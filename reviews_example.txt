utter garbage. terrible story, terrible acting, ridiculous special effects.

this movie literally made me tired sitting through it. in the best sort of way. i felt exhausted like i was along for the ride. it’s a great action movie and is pretty much go-go-go from the beginning with little time wasted on exhibition.

excellent and captivating cinematography. top tier action and story accompanied with excellent pacing. an immersive adventure off originality. exceeds the original films in everyway.

i really don't understand how this movie is rated so high. i was hoping that it wouldn't be any worse than thunderdome. it's like mad max meets the rocky horror pic show. i've never not finished watching a movie and am highly disappointed that i sat thru the entirety of fury road. never will watch it a second time.

i saw it at the theater and walked out, i don’t walk out of many movies but it is simply terrible, not entertaining and i was bored.  i like charlize theron but it sucked.  by the way, i sat through the ending later because i had to see if it had a happy ending and it did, but it didn’t help, still was terrible!
