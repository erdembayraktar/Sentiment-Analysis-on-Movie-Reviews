No Name,4.5,"**the two towers** is pure cinematic magic. peter jackson was *born* to helm this trilogy, and this middle chapter cements why. visually, it‚Äôs a feast‚Äîbreathtaking landscapes, epic battles, and a perfect translation of tolkien‚Äôs world to the screen. ian mckellen‚Äôs gandalf is as legendary as ever, and sean astin‚Äôs sam adds so much heart, loyalty, and charm to the journey. the storytelling is tight, tense, and brimming with iconic moments‚Äîfrom gollum‚Äôs inner turmoil to helm‚Äôs deep, which remains a masterclass in battle sequences.   howard shore‚Äôs soundtrack? flawless. it pulls you deeper into this world, elevating every scene. the runtime is hefty, sure, and while it‚Äôs not *boring*, it‚Äôs definitely a commitment‚Äîbut one worth every second. this film has aged like fine wine and never fails to surprise me on rewatch. it‚Äôs not just a sequel; it‚Äôs an upgrade. a masterpiece through and through.",positive

No Name,5.0,"the second of three, this beautiful film has stunning cinematography, especially ially in the battles (helms deep being the most notable.) sam's speech at the end is so inspiring and gives you a feel of not just what the characters are feeling, but also what j. r. r. tolkien must of have felt back in ww1. i recommend yhe extend editions, but the theatrical will still be an amazing experience.",positive

No Name,5.0,this is the empire strikes back of lord of the rings. howard shore is the goat . fantastic composer. the battle at helms deep is so awesome. the academy awards dropped the ball and only giving two towers best effects and sound editing? you mean chicago is the best movie over two towers ? get the fuck out. legolas and gimli counting kills ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ 10/10 epic fantastic.,positive

No Name,5.0,"it may sound odd to refer to ""the two towers"" as underrated, but it is all relatively speaking. for some reason, of the original trilogy, this one gets the least amount of love. as of writing this review it is the lowest ranked on imdb ( #14 on the top 250, where the other two are in the top 10). it won only 2 oscars, where the first won 4 and the final won 11. so, i'm not sure whether this is an unpopular opinion or not, but this is my favorite lord of the rings movie.  to a certain degree, i can understand why it's comparatively ignored. the first one begins the grand adventure, the third concludes it in grand fashion and the second just continues the story set up in the first. but this one introduces so many of the staples that would come to be synonymous with the series. this is where andy serkis as golem really gets to shine. characters like wormtail, treebeard, eowyn and carl urban are introduced. the action in this one is the best of the trilogy. the battle for helm's deep is thrilling, creative, huge and epic. the battle might go for about 40 minutes of runtime, but it never feels repetitive. you're rooting for these characters to succeed against all odds.  unlike the first movie, since the fellowship has broken up into smaller groups, the movie is able to cut between each of their side-adventures. there is not a side adventure in the movie that i don't find engaging, they are all interesting to watch. these multiple stories also help with the pacing of the movie. it feels like peter jackson was making an extra effort to have the story move at a quicker pace. the movie is a minute longer than the first, but it feels much shorter and easier to watch.  it makes sense, where the first movie takes time to get started and the third takes time to wrap up, the second can spend all its time in the adventure. and what a grand adventure it is. of all the trilogy this is the one i can rewatch the most. the middle chapter of middle earth is the best of the best.",positive
No Name,4.0,"wasn‚Äôt a fan of the cinematography. too darker than it‚Äôs predecessor. still, a solid addition to the trilogy",neutral
No Name,4.5,this film is a wonderful second edition to the trilogy. the acting is still top notch. the world created by jackson is engaging and vast. some areas seem to drag a bit but are investments for later on in the movie. i recommend the extended edition which added important and fun scenes. this is my least favorite out of the three but that does not say much since they are all masterpieces.,positive
No Name,5.0,slightly weaker than fellowship of the ring but still a 10/10 film,negative

No Name,5.0,a pillar of it's time.,neutral
No Name,4.5,"the two towers is a great movie. is it as good as the other two films in the trilogy? i personally don't think so. i found myself less invested in some of the story elements, particularly when they involved the human characters (which occupied much of the runtime). though not as strong as fellowship or rotk, this movie is full of spectacular moments.   the battle of helm's deep might be the best battle in cinematic history. from the driving force to the action to the gravitas, everything about that sequence is jaw-dropping. though incredibly dark and serious, the humor is spot-on and adds a needed layer of character development.   on top of the action, what this movie does well is develop relationships between characters. frodo and sam, legolas and gimli, frodo and sm√©agol, aragorn and √©owyn, and beyond. the relationships in this film are superb and help push the story forward.   when i want to watch incredible action and the lord of the rings: the two towers is a great movie in an amazing trilogy.   best character: gimli best moment: the battle of helm's deep (the entire thing) best quote: ""toss me."" - gimli",positive
No Name,5.0,"the lord of the rings: the two towers, is an amazing movie that perfectly combines epic battles and emotional moments. the battle of helm's deep is intense and exciting, and the characters, especially frodo, sam, and gollum, have a lot of depth that really makes you care about them. gollum, played by andy serkis, is especially impressive and feels like a real character despite being cgi. the visuals are beautiful, and the music by howard shore makes everything even more epic. with its themes of friendship and hope, this movie is a must-watch and definitely deserves five stars.",positive
No Name,5.0,"acho esse filme um pouco superior ao seus antecedente , pois acho menos arrastado e mais rapido , oque deixa o filme mais ameno , o filme parece que acaba rapido mas possui mais de 2 horas , sem palavras para descrever o quao bom esse filme √©.",positive
No Name,4.0,"because of the chronology of the story, so much of the book two towers has to be moved to rotk. as such, there's a lot of filler that just seems like padding in the extended edition.   yet, my last watch of the theatrical felt like a rushed mess that didn't take any time to let moments be digested.  the technical marvels still on display all these years later hold up. the performances are strong (though the character development is muted).  helms deep remains one of the greatest battles; gollum still scintillates; bernard hill gives theoden a tragic majesty.  one version moving too quickly, another version too padded without significant dedication to character development; the two towers still remains an essential watch being part of the greatest examples of filmmaking one will ever see.",positive
No Name,5.0,"the perfect cast, respects the lore to give us an amazing story and awesome design. deserves all the praise it gets.",positive
No Name,5.0,"all three movies are awesome. this one is the weakest of the trilogy but still a 5/5 star rating, thats how good they are.",positive

No Name,5.0,"bombastische kampfszenen, unglaubliche spannung beim kampf zwischen gut + b√∂se. die ausstattung + cinematography sind einzigartig. das erlebnis des films war besser als meine fantasie beim lesen des buchs. als w√§re man selbst dabei gewesen. geniale filmmusik.",neutral
No Name,5.0,"""the lord of the rings: the two towers""**  *the two towers*, the second film in *the lord of the rings* trilogy, stands as my personal favorite, not only within the trilogy but also as a cinematic experience in its own right. the film, directed by peter jackson, takes the momentum built by *the fellowship of the ring* and propels it to new heights, blending intense action, deep character development, and stunning visual storytelling.  what makes *the two towers* remarkable is its seamless juggling of multiple storylines, each as engaging as the other. frodo and sam‚Äôs perilous journey toward mordor, guided by the treacherous yet pitiable gollum, presents a tense and psychological exploration of the corrupting power of the ring. andy serkis‚Äô performance as gollum, enhanced by groundbreaking motion capture technology, is nothing short of revolutionary. gollum‚Äôs internal conflict, brilliantly captured in the ""two personalities"" scene, adds a complex layer to the narrative, deepening the themes of duality and inner struggle.  meanwhile, aragorn, legolas, and gimli‚Äôs pursuit of the uruk-hai who captured merry and pippin brings us into the heart of rohan, where the movie's epic scale truly begins to unfold. the introduction of rohan‚Äôs people, particularly king th√©oden (played by bernard hill), √©owyn (miranda otto), and √©omer (karl urban), enriches the political and emotional stakes of the war. theoden's journey from a king ensnared by despair to a leader reclaiming his courage is one of the most powerful arcs in the film.  of course, *the two towers* is perhaps most famous for the battle of helm‚Äôs deep, a masterclass in large-scale battle sequences. the sense of tension and desperation builds as the seemingly unstoppable forces of saruman‚Äôs uruk-hai assault the fortress, culminating in a heroic last stand that feels both intimate and epic. jackson‚Äôs ability to make every moment of the battle feel personal, whether it‚Äôs aragorn rallying the troops or legolas and gimli‚Äôs friendly competition, makes this sequence an emotional high point.  one of the film‚Äôs strengths is its ability to maintain a balance between spectacle and character. despite the large-scale action, it never loses sight of the personal struggles of each character. frodo‚Äôs growing weariness, sam‚Äôs unshakeable loyalty, and aragorn‚Äôs inner conflict about his destiny all serve as emotional anchors, making the stakes of the war deeply personal for the audience.   howard shore‚Äôs score once again shines, with new musical motifs that perfectly capture the majesty of rohan and the ominous presence of saruman‚Äôs forces. the music elevates the emotional resonance of key scenes, from the sorrowful laments in edoras to the triumphant arrival of gandalf and the riders of rohan at helm‚Äôs deep.  for me, *the two towers* excels because it takes the themes introduced in *the fellowship of the ring* and intensifies them, exploring the price of heroism, the weight of choices, and the bonds of friendship in a world descending into war. it‚Äôs a film that perfectly balances darkness and hope, showcasing not just the epic scope of tolkien‚Äôs world, but also the intimate human struggles within it.  ultimately, *the two towers* is a thrilling, emotionally rich experience that stands out as the most engaging and powerful entry in the trilogy. it‚Äôs a film i return to frequently, and each viewing only deepens my admiration for its intricate storytelling, unforgettable characters, and epic vision.",positive

No Name,5.0,"spoiler warning this movie is incredible and my personal favorite movie of all time (tied with the other two in the trilogy). there is so much to love in this movie so i summed it all up with this one scene.   remember the great stories, mr. frodo this scene fills me with motivation even in the darkest of times. after frodo is corrupted by the ring and is mentally forced to kill samwise on the dark outskirts of mordor, frodo has lost all hope and doubts whether he should keep going or not. however, samwise reminds him of the great stories, when heroes kept going even when times were tough and all looked lost. as samwise's speech echoes onto the renowned battle of helm's deep and the flooding of isengard, frodo starts to realize that, even if it is but a tiny sliver, there is hope.  what makes this scene so emotional is that this happens to almost everyone. there will be a point in your life when you feel like nothing is left, and this scene is a beautiful reminder of why there is always a future no matter the circumstances. you are capable of so much and any human can push through anything, it just takes true will to do so.  this scene concludes the movie in spectacular fashion as things look bright for the battle of helm's deep and our heroes go on to continue their journey. my eyes fill with tears every time i hear samwise the brave talking over howard shore's beautiful score. this scene also portrays true brotherhood and that you can lift anyone (including yourself) up just with some positive thinking.  in conclusion, this film is a breathtaking masterpiece that serves as an amazing build up to the grand finale. i feel like every individual scene had heart and soul put into it and has a valid reason for why it's there. this movie also has deeper themes of brotherhood, perseverance and addiction. i highly recommend viewing this incredible trilogy as it represents what makes us human and what we are capable of.",positive
No Name,5.0,"my favorite of all 3 installments of the trilogy. the two towers will take you into a roller coaster of emotions. it is exciting, funny and emotional. the battle scenes are out of this world. the epic entrances of heroes are the best i have ever seen in any movie ever. it has everything: from funny moments to screams of excitement and boo-hoo crying your eyes out.   the two towers mostly concentrates on rohan and saruman, while frodo and sam embark on their own journey. it is fascinating to see the film develop and how the stories (like the fellowship) are supporting one another, even unknowingly.  there is just a level of perfection to this movie that it is impossible to surpass. peter jackson set a standard that is just unfair to measure other directors.",positive
No Name,4.5,"while not surpassing the previous film, it does manage to surpass 99% of other movies. it continues with the high level of quality of the first film. all around a great film and sequel.",positive

No Name,4.0,"could you imagine acting in a lengthy fantasy movie where all your character did was hang out with a group of animated trees for the entire time? or would your role in the whole film be known most for literally kicking the bucket? anyway, <i>the two towers</i> is a fun movie for fans of the fantasy genre. almost halfway through watching the extended edition of the film, i started running the math to conclude the trilogy could have been a twelve or thirteen-episode season for some random streaming service if it was produced now instead of over twenty years ago. also, i completely forgot brad dourif is in this movie.",positive

No Name,5.0,"no tom bombadil. no valar. none of that is a problem for me.  as fantastical as middle-earth is at times, it still seems like a real place facing very real problems. one of the biggest issues with mapping out your world and its deities so much is that it can make everything else seem inconsequential or impossible to understand without saying ""well‚Ä¶ i guess the gods work in mysterious ways.""  if you need an example of this, just see the recent mcu: everything is on such a massive, scale-tipping level that it makes what happens with the street-level characters seem pretty unimportant.  that is one flaw of the ‚Äòlord of the rings' books not shared by the movies. not knowing that melkor's defeat was the *real* threat to the planet while his fractionally-as-powerful minion sauron's was just a kid trying to recreate his parent's business and failing does wonders for the gravity of the consequences.  movies > books.",positive

No Name,4.5,"what a great sequel that's all i can say that this is definitely a sequel. this is definitely a movie that you have to watch the first one to know what's going on in the second one and i think the book was like that too so throughout the movie, the first act started out with a clear mission from the first movie to get to modor, also, there's another plot line with aragorn and the rest of his friends that might play out in the third movie as well but the main thing that i really like about this movie is the third act usually third acts begin with a little slow burn and then build up to a final battle this third act in my opinion starts with the battle and finishes with the battle. and this movie is called the two towers which i can't really see the other tower but that's fine because i was fully entertained. this definitely works as a sequel. usually i like movies to  work as their own movie and a sequel but this definitely works as a sequel that you have to watch the first one to get this. the best character in this movie is a aragorn and gollum and gollum steals to sing for me because he's so twisted and crazy that is very entertaining overall battles are straight up entertaining, the characters were the same as the first one and overall i can't wait for the finale not better than the first one in my opinion but really damn good 9/10",positive

No Name,5.0,"the two towers is incredible for all of the same reasons as the other films in peter jackson's trilogy. the siege of helm's deep is, for my money, still one of the great battle scenes in cinema.  still, upon rewatching the extended edition, some of the more intimate scenes really shined through. the ""looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!"" parley had me cracking up. also, aragorn's dream/vision of arwen before he is awoken by brego. as a dude in my late 30's, there is honestly nothing sexier than the love of your life gently encouraging you to go back to sleep!",positive

No Name,5.0,"timeless movie! words can't even begin to describe how in love i am with this next chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. the characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. peter jackson is a complete genius! even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to gandalf after his fall in the mines of moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for middle earth as the one ring is taken closer to mordor and mount doom, can frodo and sam really trust gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the fellowship of the ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the kingdom of rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. if you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and i will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, legolas still for me and aragorn still for my sister. even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from elijah wood to sean aston to billy boyd to ian mchellen to orlando bloom to viggo mortenson to miranda otto to bernard hill to christopher lee to liv tyler to john rhys-davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with peter jackson behind the whole wheel. after seeing the fellowship of the ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old i get? no, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!",positive

No Name,5.0,"my personal favourite of the trilogy i do love all three films of the lord of the rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. the two towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. for one thing it is less talky than fellowship of the ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. and some of the characters are developed more here than they were in fellowship of the ring primarily frodo and aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.  when it comes to the scope the two towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. the cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. you can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. the music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. people may disagree, but i think the two towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.  the acting is very good. elijah wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while sean astin's bumbling persona suits sam really well. viggo mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. ian mckellen, christopher lee and bernard hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is gollum. here gollum is designed superbly, and andy serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and oscar-nod worthy.  in conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10",positive

No Name,5.0,"this is my favorite of the trilogy. i love how they divided the characters up so that they can grow stronger relationships with one another. and also making them the focus and we focus on how they grow, change, and become more likeable. it's a little harder to grow your characters when they are all together. some movies succeed at that and some fail. but peter jackson played a genius move by having them split up in order to focus on some more. there is more action in this one and i loved that. the battle for helms deep wasn't just a minute and i liked that because it's a big thing that happened. and i was intrigued through and through. gollum i think was properly introduced in this movie. the adventure advanced really well compared to the others. the other movies have great adventure but i like this one a little more. if i had to critique one thing, i think they spent a little to much time with rohan. some of it was engaging but after a while i think they should've moved on. in the first movie it made sense because they had to help the king but after a while i felt like they should've moved on. the acting was great and i think if you loved the first you'll love this one.",positive

No Name,5.0,absolute masterpiece <3,positive
No Name,5.0,"two towers did a fantastic job following up fellowship. this movie separates our ring bearing group and allows them to have their own journeys simultaneously, and juggles it well. near perfect movie and great 2nd part of the greatest trilogy of all time!",positive
No Name,5.0,"the two towers is still an absolutely fantastic movie and is nearly perfect, but i think that fellowship of the ring is just a little bit better.  gollum is obviously an absolute scene stealer every single time that he is on screen.  the final battle in helm's deep is grand and fantastical as well as emotional and sometimes comedic.  just an overall amazing film and a great follow-up to the first.",positive
No Name,4.5,"although all three of the movies are really good, two towers is still my third favorite one. it's still a very good film. in many aspects, it improves upon the first film. there are obvious new characters and locations, there is much more cgi and the battle scenes get much bigger. the battle of helm's deep is just truly epic and well choreographed.  i must say, gollum is exceptional. he was a huge technical achievement in 2002. his character is meant to be a villain, yet he is very sympathetic. and yes, ""my precious!"" is one of the best lines of this century. the two towers also has all the qualities that make up most good second films in a trilogy. it ends in a point where the heroes are at danger or have lost. this will make their victory in the final movie much stronger. frodo and sam are in danger by the end as they have teamed up with an untrustworthy ally, gollum.  honestly it is very hard to compare all the three movies and everyone might have their favorite because all three of them are amazing. even though this is the weaker one it is still one of the best films of the 2000s. it really shows what a great trilogy this is. everything great about the first film is still there here which is part of what makes it such a good sequel.",positive
No Name,5.0,best trilogy of all time!!!,positive
No Name,4.5,"the scope gets bigger, the stakes are higher, in other words, the spectacular second part grants a thrilling viewing experience. it just flows perfectly and it never stops; it benefits so much from the long runtime. the epic battle of helms deep tops the movie exquisitely, setting the bar high for the final.",positive
No Name,5.0,"i think this holds the #3 spot of the trilogy only because it is the bridge b/w the beginning and the end... obviously still an amazing movie, highly recommend!!!",positive
No Name,4.5,"best of the trilogy (but not by a long shot). mostly because of andy serkis, we saw a darn lot of him in this movie and it was completely necessary for this films success. i highly recommend  watching the two part extended version. trust me, once you watch it, you will never want to watch the original again.",positive

No Name,5.0,"the second installment in the lord of the rings franchise proves just as, if not more, incredible than fellowship.  andy serkis, elijah wood, and sean astin are enthralling as the three hobbits (one heroic, one corrupted, and one working in the direction of the latter), and ian mckellan and viggo mortensen outshine nearly every other performance in the history of cinema.  epic battles and heartfelt dialogue capture the exact reason that i go to watch movies.",positive

No Name,5.0,second greatest film of all time. just behind fellowship of the ring.,positive
No Name,5.0,"the strengths of the first movie didn't necessarily carry over to this one, but it was still fantastic in its own right with its own set of attributes that made it so. most notable by far were the film score, arguably the most memorable of the three movies, followed by the introduction of gollum and the revolutionary cgi quality that came with him. the flaws in this one have the benefit of being made much worse by their expansion in the third movie, that being the deus ex machina and frodo's transformation into a burdensome wuss, and even those could be considered more a gripe with the source material than the actual filmmakers. the final battle is truly something to behold here, both for its obvious high quality and for the endless series of lotr videogames with levels based on it.",positive
No Name,4.5,"[‚≠êÔ∏è89%]  the second movie in the lord of the rings franchise, the two towers (2002) maintains the same quality as its predecessor as well as expanding upon it in other places such as the world and creatures.  as the fellowship is broken, the remaining former members are separated into smaller groups which actually allows for some development for characters, whether they are important like aragorn or more of a side character like pippin.  the two towers (2002) actually offers a lot more greater things than the fellowship of the ring (2001) with diving deeper into themes about the hypnosis the ring provides as well as some huge scale battles, however the pace is a lot slower and more dialogue heavy than its predecessor, which at points can be really long to sit through.  other than it's slower pace, the lord of the rings: the two towers (2002) provides yet another fantastic addition to the trilogy.",positive

No Name,5.0,this is in my opinion the best lor of the rings movie. gollum is such a good character,positive
No Name,5.0,"the lord of the rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. i have already written a review for the fellowship of the ring, in which i talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. that is why i won't talk about those things in this review. rather i will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation.  percy jackson has done a really great job. the story picks up from the part where gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. this not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. while previously we believed gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. this is the reason why it paid off to see him return as gandalf the white.  the thing i really like aobut gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. in one moment he is being spun around by saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. in the first movie he scared bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the hobbits in the party. this is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. this way we get to see him from multiple perspectives.  the second character i'd talk about here would be gollum. the first time i saw him i thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (jar jar from star wars prequels, dobby from harry potter etc). but he's very different. earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. however, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. this is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. this message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself.  speaking of the scene where gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. this is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something peter jackson was able to handle. even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how gollum was feeling while planning to kill frodo and not how he was actually looking like. there have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but i don't want to spoil the movie for you.  and that scene was interrupted by sam, who is the next character i'd speak about. sam is frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure frodo is safe. he is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped frodo from wearing the ring. sam had heard that gollum wanted to kill frodo and even though gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the mountain of doom, sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. frodo didn't trust him or rather should i say, didn't want to trust him. and in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, sam never wasted any time to get back to saving frodo.  the movie also has many battle scenes, cool cgi, shows the fellowship of the ring fight alongside other kingdoms while gandalf is not there to protect them. the action, the comic timings, the cgi, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. the only mistake i made watching this was that i watched the theatrical cut of this movie. because of this i missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which i was thinking would be answered in return of the king. it has something to do with saruman. so don't make that mistake. i'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch.  the two towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and i really wish it was talked about more. only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. that doesn't mean it's bad. that just means this trilogy should be watched more. since the fellowship of the ring is the beginning of the adventures and the return of the king is the conclusion, the two towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. but in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. it is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place.",positive
No Name,5.0,"the two towers somehow improves on its predecessor. gigantic action, deep character moments, and a heaping of shakespearean dialogue. this is a movie (no, a film) for the ages.",positive
No Name,5.0,"lord of the rings: the two towers is a masterpiece. the two towers continues the story of the fellowship as they travel through the lands of rohan and the country of gondor to get to mordor to destroy the ring of power. gollum is an amazing character and getting to see both sides of him added so much more depth to his character. the uruk-hai are menacing in this movie along with saruman, he actually feels like a real threat along with his foot soldiers and you get the sense that anyone can die in all 3 of these movies, with the stakes being set at the end of fellowship. but the bar is raised as king theoden and the people of rohan retreat to helm's deep where they fight what is undeniably one of the greatest battles in cinematic history. i could go about this movie for days, but you get the point. i love it, and i always will.",positive
No Name,5.0,"(extended edition)  this one is always better than i remember it being. definitely the black sheep of the trilogy.  the extended cut isn't as good as fellowship's in my opinion as there are too many extraneous scenes in this cut that only serve to stifle the pacing. the worst offenders are the additional scenes of merry & pippin which were already the slowest parts of the theatrical cut. in this cut we get entire scenes that are utterly pointless and barely add anything, as well as some more comedically focussed scenes that seem awkward and out of place in the overall film.  there are other scenes that help flesh out and develop characters which i feel should have been included in the theatrical version. for example, we get a much better explanation of aragorn's lineage and history in this cut which is very important given the key role he plays in the plot of the return of the king.  overall, i feel the theatrical cut of this film is the superior, especially for a more casual viewer. it may gloss over some aspects, but the pacing is much better. i think i'll continue watching the extended cut though, purely because it has more content.",positive
No Name,5.0,amazing a must see clasic,positive
No Name,5.0,the epic second installment to the greatest trilogy ever created. the masterpiece of helm's deep should serve as the ultimate model for any cinematic battle for the future.,positive
No Name,4.0,"in a sense my score for this is an average between what i consider to be a 3~3.5/5 theatrical cut and a 4.5/5 extended cut, as these two versions of the movie are very, very different in terms of quality, considerably moreso than either of the other two lotr films.  the biggest problems inherent are in regards to pacing, and establishing the new characters in a way that works as well as in fellowship (which had considerably more to introduce but somehow did a far better job).  the extended cut of the two towers still doesn't do as good as fellowship (or return, for that matter) in terms of its character dynamics or its extension of world-building, but it is a vast improvement and certainly does an overall good job with both of these.  simply put, this is one of those movies (like troy & chronicles of riddick) where the extended cut's additions are so good at adding much-needed context that, despite their increased run-times, actually feel like much shorter films than their shorter versions.  like the other two, the cinematography, music, production design, sound design, acting and action-sequences are all top-notch, still effective to this day, and serious props to everyone for managing to successfully make a 45-minute action sequence that managed to keep the stakes high.  it's needed viewing to experience the whole story, and while it's the weakest of the three, it's still usually very good quality, only sometimes dipping into ""good not great"" territory from time to time.",positive

No Name,4.5,"not quite as remarkable as fellowship or return but it's still a phenomenal second chapter: the visual effects are still top notch as well as the sets, cinematography, score and costumes/makeup, the action is also a major improvement over the first with the battle of helm's deep obviously being one of the best battles in history, andy serkis gives a fantastic performance as gollum and provides us with a conflicting character that we don't know how to feel about, i also loved seeing how sauron's take over of middle earth is actually affecting middle earth as shown with the situation of rohan. the biggest issue is the pacing of the movie. it drags on in the middle for quite a lot and being the middle chapter, it lacks the setting up of the first movie or the pay off of the third movie and we don't get as many locations and we spend a bit too much time with the rohan subplot but it's still an emotional, suspenseful, satisfying and exciting second chapter with great characters and moments.",positive
No Name,4.0,"the two towers is grand in spectacle and (eventually) extremely thrilling. as much as i love this installment and the entire series, this middle entry of the series gets a bit bogged down in picking up the pieces of the first and setting up the finale to be independently spectacular. in comparison with the fellowship of the ring, the adventure is far less expansive and the protagonists being consistently split makes for a less cohesive story telling. what this movie is most famous for - the battle at helm's deep - earns its reputation and is the pinnacle of high fantasy action to date.",positive

No Name,4.0,"i might not have enjoyed it as much as the first film, but 'the lord of the rings: the two towers' is still a terrific film no doubt.  visually it still looks superb, i really do love the look of these films so far. the main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. there is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences.  there are, though, a few bits i found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. i found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. bernard hill. the side story, meanwhile, with billy boyd and dominic monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.  elijah wood remains good though. i did enjoy seeing the journey of frodo and sam (sean astin). andy serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! any scene with those three = outstanding.  overall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. one very much worthy of following 'the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring', despite a few 'issues' i have with it.",positive

No Name,4.0,"the first film's sprawling, epic world is still in good hands! while it certainly is a step down from the fellowship of the ring, it still brings you a sense of awe. andy serkis is masterful as gollum, and the added in humor is a wise decision, making this a worthy road to the final installment. frodo and sam do not appear as much though, and the fight scenes are too plentiful to really feel excited towards the next one, because you really know who is going to win, and you wonder why the editing isn't here enough. still, i feel optimistic that the return of the king learn from its predecessors mistakes and reach a stunning victory.",positive
No Name,5.0,"the characters, story and world are incredibly put together and peter jackson has done a fantastic job adapting the books.  i didn't know anything about tolkien prior to the first in the trilogy being released so i read the hobbit in preparation. what followed over the next three years watching these films was the most memorable movie experiences i've ever had. these films brought me to tears in certain parts, something which is exceptionally rare with me as i'm not an emotional person whatsoever. i read the trilogy after and still to this day hold tolkiens world in high regard.",positive
No Name,5.0,a little weaker than the first and third instalments however it is still magnificent and one of the best films of all time. of course it's weaker state is due to the fact that it got the middle portion of the story which usually conveys more storytelling and building up rather than memorable and epic sequences.,positive
No Name,5.0,best of the lotr movies,positive
No Name,3.5,an improvement over its predecessor for sure. two towers substitutes long sequences getting to know characters for sharper action and battle sequences while adding some nice new characters to the mix. a good middle chapter,positive

No Name,4.5,"though it is quite a tonal shift from the first movie and not as fast paced, it is more accurate and faithful to the source material than the fellowship of the ring's film adaptation, and the two towers definitely introduces deeper and more important chemistry between characters, so while peter jackson's first two lord of the rings movies are different in some ways, i believe that the two towers matches and maybe even exceeds the already near-flawless fellowship of the ring.",positive
No Name,5.0,"the first film sets up the world of middle earth, but the second film in the trilogy sets up higher stakes. somehow you think it‚Äôs near impossible to top yourself on a visual spectacle, but peter jackson (director) clearly got comfortable and ready to escalate. this film has one of the best battle sequences of all time in cinema. the scope is even bigger and the story just expands to new dimensions through new and old characters. gollum is a cgi masterpiece and has more depth than a normal human character would possess. once again middle earth surpasses expectations.",positive

No Name,5.0,"the lord of the rings: the two towers is honestly a brilliant sequel and it's even a masterpiece and a half. the movie's got a brilliant story, which follows on straight after the first movie and it's about frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) arriving to mordor with the help of gollum (andy serkis).  a number of new allies join their companions team to defend the well known isengard, while saruman (christopher lee) deploys an assault from his territory.  the cast are all honestly brilliant with their performances throughout this movie and the same goes with their dialogue. all of the characters dialogue which is given throughout this movie is all honestly great and non of their dialogue feels weak at all.  the cinematography which was shot by andrew lesnie, who did the first one's cinematography does another brilliant job at capturing the scenes so smooth and so beautifully. he does it so well and he makes the scenes look so amazing.  also, there's a lot more of the action sequences throughout this movie and they are very clever, very graphic and very unique just like the first ones were and they are all very well choreographed.  the movie's even got such a beautiful soundtrack, the score which was beautifully composed by howard leslie shore oc. he does such a great job with the soundtrack and it goes so well with the scenes they've been placed within this movie.  the movie's even got some brilliant humour, which always hits and it never misses. that's mainly from gimli (john rhys-davies) his character adds some really funny humour throughout this movie, which adds to his character quite a bit.  the movie's even got more dark themes (in my opinion), they add a lot more to the different locations which we end up discovering throughout this movie and it's done so well, which i really liked.  finally, the love interest in this movie is very well built up and it doesn't feel rushed at all, it's a very interesting one and i think it works quite a bit.  the pacing which this movie's got is all honestly brilliant and all of the moments are all built up very well and non of those scenes fail in any sort of way because they are all built up brilliantly.  the orcs throughout this movie have got more of a darker and more of a graphic look to them, which i think added a bit more of a disturbing look to them, which i really liked.  overall, lord of the rings: the two towers is honestly a brilliant sequel. the movie's got a brilliant story, brilliant performances, great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, clever action sequences, brilliant pacing, a beautiful soundtrack, brilliant humour, dark themes, more disturbing looking orcs and an interesting love interest.  i'd honestly recommend this movie, if you enjoyed the first one and if you're into fantasy/action movie's. i think this movie is honestly worth the watch and you'll probably enjoy it as much as the first one.",positive
No Name,5.0,"a brilliant middle chapter of an incredible trilogy, combined with jackson's direction, the script he co-wrote with walsh, boyens and sinclair, the performances of the cast, shore's score, lesnie's cinematography, horton's editing, major's production design, hennah and lee's set decoration, dickson and taylor's costume design, action sequences, sound design and visual effects, the two towers interlopes through three storylines incredibly effective and makes a beautiful and entertaining film!!!",positive

No Name,4.5,"this is a wonderful film. the entire helm's deep sequence is incredibly impressive visually, on the level of mad max: fury road. the special effects are really well done for a 2002 movie, and the score is absolutely flawless. my favorite part of this film is the anticipation that builds for the battle at helm's deep; it really feels like the whole story is leading to that scene. my only complaints are that things feel a little rushed (and as a disclaimer, i watched the theatrical version, not the extended edition). character motivations are often lacking, so a lot choices don't always make sense and character's seem to do this just for the sake of advancing the plot. similarly, the character development all felt a bit rushed, especially compared to the wonderfully rich development found in the novel version. but overall, these are minor criticisms. this movie is still incredible.",positive

No Name,5.0,i absolutely loved this film and i love lord of the rings so much. i love that they put gollum on the front row and some of my all-time favorite scenes are the scenes with gollum. i love that this takes place right after fellowship it really feels more like a journey. i can't get enough of the amazing score its just so good. some say this is the most perfect trilogy and i see why it is literally perfect. i love the makeup and prosthetics it is so good and the orcs look disgusting because of that and i love every single second of it i'm glad they didn't use motion capture suits for the orcs as the hobbit did. these films are an achievement in storytelling in keeping a whole journey and feeling like your really there and connected with them over three years. i can't get enough of the absolutely amazing worldbuilding it is literally amazing and nothing else can top it at all. peter jackson really did something amazing with this film that i don't think can be done again and if anyone else would have made this it would be so different and it would probably be worse. i'm so excited to see andy serkis as alfred in the batman he is such a good actor and needs an oscar nomination by now. i'm glad that they only do one thing that really is cgi throughout the entire movie and that is gollum which i love and i love the practical effects and not the cgi and green screen. this film has so many iconic things like the lines and everything about it is iconic from the characters to the score its all amazing. they try to humanize which gollum which i didn't think they would have but i love that they showed him in human form and andy serkis did an amazing job outside the motion capture suit which gets me more excited for the batman. this film has some of my all-time favorite lines as does the whole trilogy. smeagol is one of my all-time favorite film characters and he is so iconic. there are so many amazing grand-scale shots that show off the grand-scale of new zealand and they all look beautiful mixed with the film they shot on makes it look amazing and adding the score to that makes it some of the best shots of all time. i love the buildup for the battle of helms deep and it is one of my all-time favorite battles. this film again has one of the biggest cliffhangers of all time and i wish one of the companies would come out with the 9 hour and 30-minute version of it i would watch that so much.  like the last one they don't use sfx only but one time and that is for gollum which the sfx really holds up for all of the sfx now with endgame and lion king. i really cannot get enough of the amazing score i could listen to it for hours and not get bored it that's how much i love it. like before the sound mixing and editing are on point with the battle at the end sounding amazing and the elephant looking things too. i love the locations they used it this getting more into mordor and the color grading making it look like more of mordor it looks fabulous. the cinematography looks amazing. the script like the last film is amazing and it baffles me that one trilogy can earn 30 nominations/wins it just is outstanding that a film trilogy can do that and if you don't think this trilogy is perfect look at the oscar love that this got. like the previous film they develop their characters out so well i just love it and when characters have those heart to heart moments i just love those scenes and those are some of my favorites. the acting is on point and everyone is giving it their all especially elijah wood if just like the previous film if there was anything snubbed it was elijah wood's acting he actually is a really good actor and i wish he got more major roles after lord of the rings but he didn't he could have been a major hollywood star. the editing mixed with the suspenseful score creates these tense full scenes that i just love. the action scenes really hold up after all these years. overall i absolutely loved this film and would recommend it to anyone. üíØ%,positive

No Name,4.5,"as with the fellowship of the ring, this is truly a beautiful and faithful adaptation of the book by tolkien. the cast is absolutely perfect and the shots are stellar. the battle of helm's deep is captivating and you will find yourself holding your breath as you vicariously feel the dismay of the people being besieged. another masterpiece by jackson.",positive
No Name,5.0,the two towers follows up fellowship of the ring and somehow manages to excel it. all the characters are well-rounded and extremely likeable and the plot keeps the audience intrigued all the time. it also introduces many new characters but never feels like anybody is being sidelined. golem is extremely interesting and there is a lot of really nice tension with the threat of sauron . the massive battle at the end of the film is expertly shot and keeps you on the edge of your seat - this film is a must see!,positive

No Name,5.0,"fate would have it that the two towers is the quintessential post 911 allegory; faceless world altering evil being stood up to my the united grieving good of the little person. when gandalf or sam or merry or faramir speaks they're speaking using tolkien's words through time and talking directly to us. undoubtedly the success of this and the other rings movies are that they are lovingly and reverently adapted by teams of indie creatives at the height of their passion and the tops of their game. however, it's enduring legacy and legendary status owes itself to the fact that the two towers had, and still has, a reason to exist in the world. it speaks to what fantasy was made for and it bolsters the human spirit and champions hope and understanding, forgiveness and love.   there's a sensitivity here not usually applied to middle films in a trilogy but making the groundbreaking meld of cgi and characterisation of sm√©agol/gollum the central arc of the story is very smart. it gives the film thrust and purposeful connective tissue to return of the king. his arc from gollum to sm√©agol and to gollum again is sad, important and due to andy serkis also hilarious. it does everything a middle film should, introduces new characters, fleshes out old and builds tension to the third film. the battles are bigger but no less well crafted and every side story is a worthwhile one.   the extended version is a difficult bag, all the scenes removed are extraneous certainly, but are all brilliant moments and in any other film, indispensable. boromir and faramir scenes manage to actually give more relatability to a character that's already dead and the funeral of th√©oden's son is incredibly sad, poignant and pertinent.",positive
