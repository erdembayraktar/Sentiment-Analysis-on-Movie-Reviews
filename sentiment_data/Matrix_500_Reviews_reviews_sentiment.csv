No Name,5.0,"fantastic movie, one of the great epics",positive
No Name,2.0,it‚Äôs not aged well. the action scenes are quite cringeworthy and the plot is advanced by characters who just tell you what their motives are.,positive
Paul T,5.0,best movie of all time,positive
Chris,5.0,amazing. please bring more older movies back to the theater.,positive
No Name,5.0,this first movie of the trilogy is an absolute masterpiece. love it!,positive
No Name,2.5,"it's a very enjoyable average movie. the cinematography, effects, message, villain,  and action are  all masterpieces. however that is not enough to make it a masterpiece of a movie. the characters, aside from the main agent(who is flawless i might add), were poorly written, very poorly  written. this movie's biggest problem: telling the audience something is different from explaining it to them. you can tell me the neo is the chosen one, you can tell me that morpheus views him as the chosen one, but you have to explain why. this movie saying ""well, it;s because morpheus views him as one"" is not an explanation, because this movie established morpheus's credibility. the romance was mediocre at best, at least you could tell it was going to happen unlike other movies that just shove it out of left it. i suppose that's something in this movie's favor, but it still doesn't elevate the romance out of nowhere. addiotnally, this movie has what i like to call the ""pointless side characters problem"", when there's too many characters, poorly written, that just endlessly remove screen time from the main characters, leading to every single character(well almost in this case), being underdeveloped. i didn't even understand why neo wanted to find the matrix, this movie never once answered that question. it's also incomprehensible how he got so good at the matrix. this is a critique one has to be careful of, because it could easily be thrown at every single sci-fi movie. often times i think it's thrown around unjustifiably, but this movie is not one of those times. there is no logical reason why neo should be able to beat the agent. because this movie never explained why he was looking for the matrix, and why he was the chosen one! in star wars, luke destroying the death star is justifiable, because the movie explained why he had the power of the force, and obi-wan helped him through the power of the force. you don't need some elaborate, 20 minute exposition, something as simple as what star wars did was enough. another thing i will point out, the acting, ranges from bad to mediocre. i think reeves was miscast in this role, which might be the biggest hot take in this review(which is a hot take in it of itself). his gives just a dry performance, which is not always a bad thing (works for jon wick), but it does not work for this movie. there is never an ounce of emotion shown in his face, and that really lower the quality of the movie. that pretty much goes for every character in this movie. except for the agent smith. hugo weaving  gives a superb performance. it's exactly how a character like that is supposed to act. and his motivations were explained. he wants to be free of the world he operates in, and by getting to zion, he will achieve that. perfect! that was a 3 minute scene at most, maybe even a minute and a half. that's all you need. i'm not even going to lie, i found myself rooting for him during the climax. this movie gave its villain(well maybe sub villain, since technically the matrix is the villain), a motivation with an explanation, but not's main character.  how sad is that. overall, it's just an average movie. if it wasn't for the villain, this movie would be a bad movie with great action, special effects, and great cinematography. those things alone are not enough to make a movie good. yes, without them a movie will be lowered in quality. but having a main character, whose motivations, and greatness are unexplained, poorly written side characters, a bland romance, and making your villain more lovable(even the motivations of who he works for are evil) than your main character are flaws to great to make this movie anything more than mediocre.",positive
No Name,3.5,"whilst the visual effects used in this film hold up excellently to this day, it is let down by inconsistencies within its plot or premise and a massive lack of variation in the pacing of its fight scenes. yet, it is home to some of the best scenes in movie history, and the concept which it attempts to explore is revolutionary for film-making. i admire that about it.",positive

No Name,2.5,"yuppie office job venting movie.  kind of like a high tech sci-fi shoot-em-up game.  bullets apparently as harmless as peas from a pea shooter; punches are like mosquito bites.  i think with enough peas and mosquitoes, anyone would at least eventually die.  you know the reason: so they can put tons and tons of violence in without actually killing the characters off before milking them for all the theatrics they can.  nothing original about that.  and just like in a fairy tale, at the end a magic kiss brings the prince back to life. i had to finally watch this thing just so i could figure out how come i've had to listen to all this pill nonsense for the past 2 decades.  as you can see, it was not very high on my bucket list having put off this deed until now.  i personally thought it sucked, but then i could respect that other people might like it if it was their style.  e.g. possibly a good movie for catharsis if you sit at a computer all day wearing a suit, and dislike cops and your boss.",positive

No Name,4.0,"the matrix is one of the most ambitious and captivating sci-fi films of all time. the action is electric, the characters are strong and there are legendary moments peppered throughout. where the film is lacking is in the actual human aspect; the romance is underdeveloped and neo's life in the matrix is superficial (why do we need a scene of his boss disciplining him?).  that being said, the fight sequences are incredibly entertaining and the entire idea of the matrix plays with your mind. i honestly fell asleep multiple times watching the film and had to go back and watch it again. from the slow motion to the muted colors, it was easy to doze off. however, once the climactic moments hit, i was enthralled. the helicopter scene is great and the final fight sequences hit hard.  i'm curious where the franchise will go from here, but this film is a brilliant start.  best character: tank best quote: ""there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path."" - morpheus best scene: the bullet dodge best piece of score: ""he's the one alright""",positive

No Name,4.5,a movie which managed to stay in our hearts.,neutral
No Name,5.0,"the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot an ordinary sci-fi movie. it's released in 1999, it's mind-blowing with story and special effects. beyond cool fights, it asks: is our world real, or a simulated prison?  the key to the matrix's success was combining action with big ideas.neo, a computer hacker who feels like something is wrong with the world. his life takes a crazy turn when he meets morpheus, a mysterious friend who reveals the shocking truth that the world neo lives in is a fake reality called the matrix. this confuses neo and sets him on a mission to find out who he is and fight the system.  what this movie does very well is create a world that feels both normal and creepy at the same time. it will be a world with busy roads. the phone rings. and computer screen even though it is something we encounter in everyday life. but there was a strange feeling. it's like something isn't right. it exploits our fears about technology and the blurred line between what is real and what is not. are we really alive or are we just like characters in a simulated world that we don't even understand?  the film's special effects were amazing for their time, especially the famous ""bullet moment"" sequence where everything slows down. this isn't just a cool fight scene. they have a deeper meaning. they represent neo's awakening. the moment he breaks free from the matrix and begins to see things clearly.  but the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmore than just a movie. it delves into some rather complicated concepts regarding philosophy and religion. think about things like ideas about choices. this movie makes you think about free will. if our world isn't real will there really be a choice for us? is there a bigger purpose? or are we just stuck in a simulated world?  the characters in this film are more than just fighters. neo's journey from confused hacker to potential hero is thrilling to watch. keanu reeves plays the role of neo perfectly. showcasing her growing confusion and determination, laurence fishburne plays morpheus, the mysterious leader who believes in neo. carrie-anne moss plays trinity. a skilled fighter who becomes neo's friend,and hugo weaving is very creepy and cool as agent smith. characters that represent the system that controls everything. the script of the film and the way these characters interact with each other is exciting and makes the film interesting and not boring.  the matrix isn't perfect. some sections may feel a little long-winded. and some people may think that keanu reeves doesn't show enough emotion. but these minor issues don't detract from the film's overall greatness. the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa groundbreaking sci-fi film that perfectly blends action, big ideas, and stunning visuals.  it's a movie that will stay with you long after it's over. it's a movie that can be watched no matter how much time has passed. with a script that is filled with insights and philosophy, it invites you to question the world around you. think about the choices you make. and consider the true meaning of freedom. what i love about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, it still holds up. you will learn more about this. it's a cinematic experience that reminds us that sometimes the most important truths are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be discovered. whether you're a sci-fi action fan or just looking for a movie that will make you think differently, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsomething i recommend you watch at least once in your life.  5/5",positive

No Name,4.5,"'the matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'metropolis', 'blade runner', 'back to the future', 'star wars original trilogy', 'alien' and 'aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.  it is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between neo and trinity being 'the matrix's' sole weak spot. this ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.  particularly striking about 'the matrix' is its production values. simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. so much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.  use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. andy and larry wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even lewis carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.  action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, kung fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.  keanu reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. carrie anne moss is strong. even better are an imposingly charismatic laurence fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing joe pantoliano and a deliciously wicked hugo weaving.  summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park.",positive

""the matrix"" seamlessly blends philosophy, action, and intrigue, weaving together a complex narrative that challenges the boundaries of our perception. the film presents philosophical questions about the nature of reality and free will, leaving audiences contemplating their own existence long after the credits roll.  the wachowski siblings deserve immense praise for their visionary approach to storytelling. their bold and imaginative direction brings the film's groundbreaking ideas to life, creating a visually striking world that remains visually stunning even years after its release. the use of slow-motion action sequences and groundbreaking special effects revolutionized the way action movies were made, influencing countless films that followed in its wake.  ""the matrix"" is a triumph of both cinematic artistry and intellectual stimulation. it combines keanu reeves' outstanding performance with an innovative and thought-provoking story, resulting in an unforgettable viewing experience. its impact on popular culture and cinema cannot be overstated, and it remains a testament to the power of daring storytelling and exceptional acting. if you haven't seen ""the matrix,"" prepare to be transported to a world where reality is not what it seems, and be prepared to question everything you know.",positive

No Name,4.5,"spoilers this film follows neo, a software developer by day, underground computer hacker by night. a man named morpheus shows neo the reality of his world, that him and everyone else are living out their lives in a fake simulation developed by the robots that now inhabit earth. it is prophesized that neo is the chosen one, and will be the hope the human race needs to free themselves from the clutches of machines.   i had high expectations before watching this movie - everyone knows the matrix, and that it's influence and references transcend cinema. i can happily say it was better than i expected! what a world to get immersed in for two hours. i loved the dystopian future setting, and found it very reminiscent of blade runner with the low key lighting, constant rain, and accompanying foreboding presence. it stood on its own two feet however with the present day earth production design and the plot of machines now controlling earth. i found it breathtaking watching the scenes and flashbacks that took place on earth, the black clouds with no sun, billions of humans encapsulated in endless spires, robots scouring the land. morpheus' ship looked incredibly 90s sci-fi, but it was great, and watching it travers the sewers was sweet. all in all the production design, costumes, sets and cgi in this movie are incredible. the look and feel is 10/10.  now onto the story. i loved the plot, humans trapped by robots in a simulation to keep them content while the robots suck their energy. a group of rebel fighters free the chosen one from his mundane fake life and train him, showing him the mind bending reality. as a viewer you feel right there with neo, because well, a lot of us live the lives neo did. all of a sudden hes being told it is all fake and we watch him struggle to process it - as a viewer i was truly side-by-side with neo and was trying to wrap my head around it too. the logic behind the matrix and the rules we learn through morpheus and the crew are all believable given the context, not to mention so incredibly cool. neo being the ""chosen one"" can be cliche, but in this movie i accepted it and didn't mind. up until the final 30 minutes i was convinced that they had the wrong guy. the payoff at the end when neo finally kills and agent is one of those rare moments where emotion, action and understanding come together in a perfect climax. let me also mention how well done the action is. great shootouts with acrobatic stunts, high stakes and uniqueness - so crazy this was back in 99.   this movie has undertones of some deep and thought-provoking themes. free will vs fate, existentialism, being controlled by a tyranical force, oppression, etc.   i was a fan of the love that blossoms between neo and trinity, but i have to say it did come a bit abruptly at the end. we get hints the entire movie that trinity feels something for him, but neo gives us next to nothing. a few more moments between them would have really cemented their feelings. another big thing i feel like is never explained is why the robots created the matrix in the first place. if they created it to keep humans sedated and satisfied so that they inevitably turn to energy - why not just trap them in the pods minus the matrix? why go through the trouble of giving a race you went to war with a whole fake universe? just grow and harvest us like you've been doing and keep us trapped or sedated. idk that question was plaguing me the whole movie. another thing is the use of guns for all the action. if the matrix is a computer simulation, and these agents and neo can see it for what it is and exploit it, i would have liked some crazy action beyond guns. there was so much more potential for mind bending fights - i mean these people can literally make this simulation their playground. its also worth a note that keanu is the best worst actor ever. he was better here than in john wick, but i didn't find much impressive in terms of his acting.   overall, the matrix is an expansive sci-fi movie with incredible action sequences, beautiful sets, world design and a mind bending story that stays grounded. i loved this film from start to finish.",positive

No Name,5.0,"people think of the matrix as the first modern sci-fi movie. if you like science fiction movies, you should put this one at the top of your list. a movie has a lot of action and a complex matrix universe that many people don&#39;t fully understand. the film that lana and andy wachowski produced entered imdb&#39;s top 20 with an 8.7 rating. keanu reeves&#39; character neo is the subject of this movie. people depend on chatgpt a lot these days. openai made chatgpt, a chatbot with artificial intelligence. this movie shows what might happen if artificial intelligence takes over and runs the world instead of people. in the year 2199, robots run this planet. you might want to know how a robot came to be in charge of this planet. to find out, you only need to go back a few decades, when people invented super- artificial intelligence. but what&#39;s interesting about this new ai is that it can feel like a person, which means that even robots have feelings. robots are used in every part of everyday life. people came to depend on robots in every way. but people used the robot as if it were a toy. but when a robot doesn&#39;t do enough for its owner, the owner just throws it away without feeling bad about it. so, they began to feel like they were being pushed around. they didn&#39;t know what the robots were up to. robots built their own country, and because they don&#39;t sleep and don&#39;t get stressed out like humans, their economy is growing very quickly every day. the robots&#39; economies are better than humans, and this worries them a lot. they were planning something very, very strange! as i already said, robots don&#39;t sleep or get stressed out, but to stay active, they need to charge themselves. sunlight is the only thing that gives them energy, and people were planning something that had to do with sunlight. people&#39;s most strange idea was when they finally figured out how to make &quot;dark strom,&quot; which makes dark clouds in the sky and blocks the sun. because of this, robots couldn&#39;t get enough sunlight to power up. the lack of sunlight was also bad for people, so this experiment didn&#39;t work out well for them either. greenland became a desert because the trees were dying. humans were at war with robots, so robots started to think about how to solve this problem, which they did. people couldn&#39;t win the war because robots came up with the idea that &quot;when a human brain activates for a function, it makes bio-electricity.&quot; robots were abducting people to make bioelectricity. people no longer have to have sex to have children. in movies, we can see many bodies that have been kept alive in cisterns. but no matter how many times the robot updates it, the matrix always has a glitch or bug. neo is also called &quot;the one&quot; in the movie. glitch can&#39;t affect neo in any way, which is why he&#39;s a threat to the matrix. the movie shows how neo started the war against machines to save humanity. not a single spoiler! enjoy the film!",positive
No Name,5.0,"the matrix is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and influential movies of all time, and there are many reasons why it is regarded as a great film. from its innovative visual effects to its thought-provoking philosophical themes, the matrix has become a classic that continues to captivate audiences more than two decades after its release.  one of the key strengths of the matrix is its groundbreaking use of special effects. the film's ""bullet time"" effect, which slows down the action to a fraction of its normal speed, has become an iconic visual motif that has been emulated countless times in movies and other forms of media. this effect, along with the film's other impressive visual effects, helped to create a truly immersive and unforgettable cinematic experience.  but the matrix is more than just a technical achievement. at its core, the movie is a philosophical exploration of reality and what it means to be human. the film's central premise, that humanity is trapped in a simulated reality created by machines, raises profound questions about the nature of reality and the limits of human knowledge. the matrix challenges viewers to question their own perceptions of the world around them and to consider the possibility that there may be more to reality than meets the eye.  the film also features memorable characters and performances that have become iconic in their own right. keanu reeves delivers a compelling performance as neo, the film's protagonist, while laurence fishburne's portrayal of morpheus is both charismatic and wise. the villainous agent smith, played by hugo weaving, is a menacing and unforgettable antagonist who embodies the oppressive nature of the matrix itself.  ultimately, the matrix is a great movie because it manages to be both intellectually stimulating and visually stunning. it combines cutting-edge special effects with a thought-provoking exploration of reality and humanity, creating a cinematic experience that is both entertaining and meaningful. it's a film that has stood the test of time and continues to inspire new generations of moviegoers.",positive
No Name,4.0,"an absolute classic entry in the science fiction genre. i think that it survives time pretty well, although there are aspects that have lost momentum over the years. overall, it is a very enjoyable watch and definitely should be enjoyed as a true popcorn movie.",positive
No Name,5.0,"once viewers are able to overcome the fact that these special effects did not stand the test of time, they're still left with a film that is action-packed and encased in a philosophically rich story that revolutionized american cinema. full of a perfect roster of actors (reeves, fishburne, moss, and more), the matrix tells the story of the future (or the present?) in which all of humanity has been overtaken by machines in the real world and are plugged into the matrix wherein they live their lives knowing nothing of true reality. the simulation called life that we all experience could all be within a computer simulation dictated by mechanical overlords who are, in reality, harvesting us for our collective heat and energy. there exist small factions of individuals who have broken free from the matrix and have seen the desolate reality in which the world actually exists and they work to help free humanity by working within (and sometimes outside of) the system to which we've all been enslaved. when one of these resistance factions, led by morpheous (laurence fishburne), gets word of a computer hacker (keanu reeves) living within the confines of the program who fits a prophecy regarding the absolution of mankind, they work quickly to try and free him from the matrix so that he might lead humanity to freedom. it's the sort of plot that might seem contrived now that there have been so many imitators, but for the turn of the century it was as absorbing as it was fascinating. there is plenty to love here, despite the one-time revolutionary special effects seeming quite dated. if you find yourself a purveyor of turn-of-the-century action movies you owe it to the original standout that made sci-fi action stylish without sacrificing compelling storytelling.",positive

No Name,5.0,"for roughly the next ten years after this came out pretty much every action scene in every movie tried to imitate this in some shape or form animated, small screen, big screen, and even commercials. it's very clear why, many have imitated it and none really have ever come close to making the elements here work so well in this all time classic. the acting in this is phenomenal. yes it has that classic 00's emotionless style of acting for a lot of character and arguably this is the film that popularized that style, but it works here mainly because of how surreal the plot is and it fits the characters. neo is awesome to watch become a total badass, smith is one of the best villains i've seen, and morpheus is a great supporting character. trinity is very good but her emotionless style sometimes misses like in the end when she confesses her love and despite small signs throughout it would've been better to actually see it more. though she is a badass also. the cinematography and special effects all hold up incredibly well and are some of the best from this era and look incredible still and fit the ascetics of the world. the pacing and editing are excellent as well which is no small task handling the expose and never making it feel overloaded. the music is really good also. everyone should give this a try. is it overrated? to an extent maybe but on its own merits its a excellent sci-fi/action film.",positive

No Name,4.5,"""i'm trying to free your mind, neo. but i can only show you the door. you're the one that has to walk through it.""  i've never been great at philosophy, but my head is exploding at the many different philosophical questions the film explores while still keeping even footing on all of them and keeping them from a messy disaster, largely because as the quote above states outright, it's like an intro course, a 101. the movie only shows the start, but you have the choice to dig further.  and the movie completely gives as much as you're willing to put into it. there's ideas of body and gender dysphoria, made clearest at its inclinations of body horror and the control of what you are perceived as by others, made both physical and mental. what do you define as real, the realistic scientific hypothesis or something more spiritual than that? the matrix entails the systems of control and its chains, describing itself as a political government controlling force (rage against the machine in the credits makes this completely unsubtle), but it's also mental self-imposed limitations, with clear zen inspiration, as well as a social control of who you are. the physical limitations to break the boundaries (learning martial arts) is still not as important as the mental limitations, that ultimately removing the obstacles (revolution) is not necessarily physically violent but a mental choice of enlightenment.  and again, somehow this does not end up a mess. even its biggest thread, the one it hammers home the most, fate and free will, still stands tall throughout. neo does not have to be the one, it's up to himself whether he believes he is or not. that the motivation you have does not have to align with destiny as it's prescribed, and the path you choose to walk down is still completely up to you. the call is not binding.  it's crazy, also, how much this movie works with the theory of gender identity, if you're willing to read it that far. the body horror isn't just for show. when the truth of you being a slave to others' concept of identity is learnt, you can at once find your body a prison, chains putting you down, finding your body horrifying and terrifying, made physical through the lens of sci-fi as metal lumps on your skin, a perceivably permanent mark, and you have to come to terms with your physical self. ultimately, even physically going against that boundary is different from the mental dysphoria, that it alone is its own self-imposed limitation. you can learn everything about how your body works (the programs to learn fighting and anything you need to know), but it ultimately does not remove how you define yourself mentally and how you are capable of changing.   this movie fucking owns is what i'm trying to say.  you can choose not to engage with any of its readings and be totally fine. visually it is a stunning film strung well by its hong kong influences, with great wirework. i think the best fight scene that shows how well put together the choreo as well as edited is smith vs. neo, how it understands fundamentals like showing a punch twice for effect, while grounding the fights in its airy spirituality. wachowskis really love catching the eye with pan shots, both vertical and horizontal. thinking of the one take of them behind the walls as they vertically climb, claustrophobic but still visually interesting. this whole film does a great job of making the frame claustrophobic. good example is in the office where neo sees the agents and crouches, keeping the whole cubicle in frame.  it can't be said how much visually this inspired so many things later that i came into contact with before this movie. a list would be longer than my lifespan, especially its influence on how guns are used in fiction period, but i think the craziest one i noticed this run around was how half-life 2 uses a sequence near the end of the film of neo running away from the agents up a staircase through an apartment, almost completely visually re-created in hl2 when running from the combine in nearly the same scenario. inspiration begets inspiration, considering how greatly well read the film already is, taking stuff from baudrillard and alice in wonderland in equal measure.  i firmly approve of don davis' work on the score. the horns here are great, and the matrix theme now with its blaring at the start fading into the code is recognizable everywhere. also when the violins get furious.... it bangs. soundtrack, on the other hand, good-ish? i'm completely down for the credits rage against the machine song, having bars like ""departments of police, the judges, the feds / networks at work, keepin' people calm / you know they went after king / when he spoke out on vietnam""... but it also goes right into a meh marilyn manson song... also marilyn manson.  it's not nearly always like that, it has some good big beat and trip hop music throughout, like the seamless transition in the rave from massive attack to the prodigy, and the rob dougan song with the red dress scene is good.  the characters themselves are pretty good although this movie does take the approach of more motivations as symbols than fully fleshed out characters, such as cypher being the blatant rejection of truth (ignorance is bliss), and while trinity does have her own agency to a point something feels off about the romance, and whether or not it earns the possible true love's kiss it spins.  i'm not sure why people dislike keanu's performance so much here. to me the common man not becoming super emotional on the outside as much as through his motivations in his actions works well for what eventually becomes a spiritual figure throughout the trilogy, or so i've been told. carrie-anne moss, laurence fishburne, and hugo weaving outperform everybody else though. i will die before forgetting weaving's ""smith"".  there's so many layers to the film, even if small, to unravel here, but overall easily worth my time to come back. gender dysphoria, government control, zen/buddhist/taoist influences, alice, communism... the movie was made for me. and it fucks.",positive

No Name,5.0,"all style and substance for one of cinema's groundbreaking sci-fi classics!  directors lilly wachowski and lana wachowski changed science-fiction and action thrillers forever with their iconic neo-noir sci-fi thriller the matrix (1999). the wachowski sisters' script is full of pastiche and homages to dark city, tron, and blade runner among westerns and martial arts films. their directing style is frenetic action shootouts with bullets blazing and fantastic visual effects to the moody atmosphere of neo-noir aesthetics. the matrix has it all with slow motion bullet time combat, bullet dodges, fearsome machine sentinels, and ruthless computer program vanguard agents. the wachowski's high concept sci-fi ideas can get confusing, though everything is explained from our reality being a computer simulation called the matrix to the real world falling into darkness after a machine uprising. it's chilling and fascinating in every scene as you attempt to figure out all of these mind numbing concepts.  i appreciate and understand the wachowski sisters' complex sci-fi story more now that i'm older as neo's choices were an allegory for their own transgender transformations, while also speaking to humanity's endless desire for technological progress into artificial intelligence. having machines with advanced ai wipe out humanity, only to harvest us for energy after we destroy the sun is a mind boggling plot, but a compelling dramatic narrative. i adore the romance drama between neo and trinity as well among the other themes like going against fate by choosing your own path to walk. the wachowski sisters never quite wrote any film as succinct and absorbing as the matrix, honestly. the matrix really is a one of a kind miracle of filmmaking.  canadian actor keanu reeves is iconic as neo in the matrix with his stoic confusion and endearing normality. keanu can be the everyman as well as a tender romantic hero once he is focused and confident as the one. american acting legend laurence fishburne is enthralling as morpheus with his endless wisdom and shocking reveals. canadian actress carrie-anne moss is sultry and sincere as trinity with her fearless fight sequences and sweet romantic moments with neo. australian acting hero hugo weaving is terrifying, hilarious, and intriguing as the rogue agent smith with his pure hatred of dissidents and loathing of humanity. his enunciation makes his every line memorable and seething with an inner rage. american character actor joe pantoliano is fantastic as the dejected and selfish cypher.  gloria foster's oracle is charming and insightful with a unique appeal. marcus chong is fun as the nervous and excitable tank. paul goddard and robert taylor nail the cold robotic movements and tone of agents brown and jones, respectively. you can feel the difference in how hugo weaving's agent smith is supposed to be unraveling into a mechanical vendetta and raving ai personality. julian arahanga's apoc is cool, but it is belinda mcclory's switch who utters the chilling famous last words, ""not like this."" anthony ray parker's boisterous dozer and matt doran's zealous mouse are interesting. marc aden gray's choi sounds just like john malkovich. every matrix actor and actress fulfilled their character acting role to perfection.  editor zach staenberg cuts so sharply and quickly from wide shots to close-ups that you'll never get bored for the matrix' 136 minutes. cinematographer bill pope brings the matrix to life with gorgeous and creative shots that utilize john gaeta's innovative visual effects to their full potential. from the startling agent smith morphing from other people into hugo weaving to the breathtaking close-up of neo and trinity kissing with literal sparks flying in the background. the matrix has a neo-noir style and bill pope really outdid himself with these fierce and unforgettable shots. owen paterson's production design looks gritty from ruined buildings to the chilling robotic world and mechanisms everywhere. all the practical effects are so gross and scary.  composer don davis has this inspiring melody for his score to the matrix that i love. the ending with rage against the machine is exhilarating to the main theme of the matrix being eerie and exciting. all the rave rob zombie music to the symphonic unsettling orchestration is all brilliant. the sound department went crazy with the emphasized hits and ambiance to the machines churning and revving to life.   costume designers kym barrett and lyn askew must have found all the black leather and latex in the 1990's as everyone looks slick and unique in the matrix. from agent smith's tailored suits to neo's trench coat or trinity's sexy black leotard. deborah taylor's creative make-up makes keanu reeves even more handsome, laurence fishburne even cooler, and carrie-anne moss ethereal as trinity. i just love her so much.  in conclusion, the matrix is worth seeing again and again as it is smart and thrilling sci-fi.",positive

No Name,3.0,"with as big as of a movie fan i am, this is actually the first time i‚Äôve seen the matrix, and after finally seeing it i feel underwhelmed. despite the revolutionary special effects, high octane action sequences, a promising story and a great ensemble cast, the film falters in its overall execution. the story is beyond overly confusing with large amounts of exposition to catch up the viewers on what‚Äôs happening. the film asks intelligent existential questions and develops an intriguing universe to accompany it, but the interest level begins to fall when it is over-beard with confusing explanations as to what‚Äôs going on with characters i don‚Äôt find too particularly engaging. although the film is a historic standpoint in special effects and storytelling, in my opinion the film feels dull and exhaustingly boring.",positive

No Name,5.0,"""the matrix is a masterpiece"" is definitely one of the most redundant phrases in movies history. the action sequences are dazzling, the soundtrack is enervating and the main trio is majestic. neo looks like a character who was written for keanu reeves, and i can say the same for lawrence fishburne as morpheus and carrie-anne moss as trinity. hugo weaving as agent smith is another show, and his voice work is possibly the best thing of the film alongside the action sequences and their revolutionary visual and special effects. joe pantoliano is also funny and i loved the twist about who is the oracle. i thought she would look like tilda swinton's character in doctor strange or something more spiritual, but no, she looks like a grandma and lives in an apartment like my grandma's! what a universe. this film successfully convinces the spectator to take the red pill.",positive

No Name,3.0,"review of resurrections.  as a fan and not a fanatic, resurrections relies too much on an assumption that the audience cares about the affection of neo and trinity for one another. fanatics probably do; fans don't.  there is little sense of triumph in the story's climax: neo's successful rescue of and reunion with trinity, especially at cost of their friends' great pain and suffering.  and for what? neil patrick harris' character the analyst is correct, most people int the fantasy world of the matrix prefer the fantasy.  his character, by the way, is the most fun and the most interesting.  sad but true, imho, the script and execution are too derivative of the earlier editions of the matrix, and fail you bring enough that builds upon them, for keanu reeves, carrie-anne moss, or anyone else to rescue the final third of the movie from proving the project a disappointment.  attempts to bring sympathetic or humorous robot mascots to the narrative are just embarrassing, not innovative.  the high five had me cringing. the special effects are cutting-edge, but exactly what we saw in earlier editions, and therefore were predictable more than breathtaking.  the fight scenes were duplicative, too long, and largely pointless.  it seemed the producers and director intended simply to remind the audience of what they enjoyed when the matrix was new and fresh. nostalgia cannot carry a movie that is two and a half hours in length. eventually, the viewer realizes that the excitement one has anticipating and awaiting never arrives. neo's abilities within the matrix are really rather trite, at times unintentionally laughable, compared to the ballet he pulled off in the earlier films.  fanatics will love this film and see it more than once. that'll help the movie make money. fans of the original matrix edition will be reminded of how unique it was and still remains, and will be rather bored with the apparent lack of similar inspiration that seems to have this attempted remake.",positive

No Name,4.0,"whoa, dude, it's the matrix. this is like the movie, right? maybe 20 years ago, sure! its prophecies of technological dystopia are spot on, almost like a very early black mirror, but they aren't as mind-blowing today simply because they aren't really that far away. does this make the movie better or worse? i dunno; up to you, i guess.  i'm sure i'm not the first one to say this, but i love keanu reeves. he plays this movie pretty straight, despite the somewhat cheesy script, but it works. carrie-anne moss also stands out in the cast, even if her character is a little one-dimensional (but to be fair, pretty much every character in this movie is one-dimensional). the special effects and technology feel a little dated, even the scenes which take place 200 years in the future, but i'm sure it felt very futuristic in 1999.  what i love about this movie is how it plays with tropes without forcing them into the plot. it cleverly introduces a kung-fu battle between student and teacher, an all-knowing prophet with mysterious revelations, and a semi-reluctant chosen one using its established pretense in a way that makes complete sense. it knows that it's paying some homages, but it never feels forced or satirical.  now unfortunately, i found the final act to be absolutely riddled with plot holes. why didn't they just spawn directly in the hostage room instead of walking through a security gate to get there? what was the point of the bomb in the building? how were they able to use a stolen helicopter's gatling gun to fill a room with bullets while never hitting the hostage once? and why didn't they just show up with a helicopter in the first place?? it makes less sense the more you think about it.  flaws and all, the matrix is a classic with an influence that's hard to overstate. it asks a lot of deep philosophical questions which are still relevant today. it's a film that's smarter than it appears, and also dumber, but in a mostly good way.",positive

No Name,4.0,"while there are some facets of this movie that were imperfect even at the time (such as slow fight execution, some nonsensical pretentious dialogue and the occasional dull camera angles), the matrix really was a game-changer, and for very good reason.  it not only created a massively engaging world of its own, using western storytelling tropes to re-explore eastern story concepts, but it even enhanced various genres in themselves; hollywood action here discovered how useful things like martial arts can be with a high-concept adventure, and the kung fu genre itself was reinvented with this somewhat, as that genre itself was struggling to break away from the two clich√©d setups: murdered master & fight contest (seriously, that was one of the main reasons why project a & police story were so revolutionary; they conceived entirely different paradigms for the genre without compromising its believability).  and to this day, you'll still see sci-fi kung fu movies, and they're generally awesome, as well as (thankfully) quite a ways different from the matrix as well.  much of the movie still holds up, and the story hits those timeless story ideas that will likely always be interesting to explore, and the ending is very, very cathartically satisfying.  the acting is generally good with hugo weaving being particularly excellent as the immensely despicable agent smith (his role also being easily the best written), and watching him meet his impactful and pain-filled end is woefully gratifying.  the only real problem is that the sequel, the matrix reloaded, dumped on almost everything good about this movie, not only retconning half of the cool ideas, but undoing numerous satisfying story beats in this movie, but those are faults of the sequel, not this movie.  instead, if you just watch this movie by itself, it's a great time - it was awesome 22 years ago, and is still kinda awesome now.",positive
No Name,4.0,"a really great sci-fi action movie. with a suspenseful and mysterious beginning, characters that aren't just 2-dimensional, and awesome action, this is a must-watch for most science fiction fans. my only minor problems are: 1. the animation hasn't aged that well, and 2. everybody talks at a volume so quiet, it's almost a whisper. other than that, it's not the best movie ever, but a very good one none the less.",positive

No Name,4.5,"to be clear- this is a a review of this film only, not the matrix series.  the matrix is one of the most iconic, stunning, and transformative films of the 21st century (1999 really).   it is perhaps one of the most important films ever.   it transformed  filmmaking with its visual impact as well as its substantive content.   its genuinely original look at the world and the place of human beings in the ""matrix"" is complex and compelling but addictively engaging.   keanu reeves, carrie moss, and laurence fishburne, and hugo weaving give the performances of their careers in this film, which has been copied for two decades but never equalled or exceeded.   it spawned an entire generation of films, including john wick.  it's visuals, cinematography, and special effects are ahead of its time.  it's fight and action choreography demonstrated that they can have an equal place in blockbuster fillmmaking.  many of the concepts and language infiltrated the social language in ways only topped by the star wars franchise.  this one is to be seen again (and again) and still holds up.   this, unlike the sequels, is a must see.",positive
No Name,5.0,"this film should be called ""keanu reeves asking questions for 2 hours straight."" it is just phenomenal how many questions he asks.  but this isn't important and i think it is primordial for me to do a proper review of this film. it was my first time watching this classic movie and the conclusion i can get from this experience is that this movie came out absolutely in the right time but also in the wrong time. it went out at the right time because it is a revolutionary movie. i never saw a movie before 1999 that had so much style. the slow motions, the fight scenes and also just the main idea of the film were so ahead of their time and i think that is why the movie went out at the perfect moment. on the other hand, i think that the movie could have been a lot better if it was made today and if the points brang previously didn't count because the only negative point of this movie is the crapy cgi which i don't blame because it was made in 1999. but, if it was made today with our technology, it would have been a bomb. that is why i want to see the fourth chapter in theatre, but, before, i need to watch the 2 and 3 which seem bad to me but i want to know what happens.  ps: i like the voice of agent smith so much.",positive
No Name,4.5,"what a masterpiece! the matrix truly is one of the best sci-fi action movies for so many reasons. firstly, the worldbuilding is so interesting, so creative and it raises these philosophical questions about what's real, what your mind sees, believing in yourself and the question of fate and the first two acts do a great job with this aspect, saving the action for the third act. speaking of action, the acting in the movie is outstanding: beautifully filmed and with incredible visual effects, choreography and techniques, taking from a wide variety of inspirations and sources and it creates some of the best action scenes and 3rd acts in cinema. the production design is incredibly with incredible cinematography and i love this green color grading for the movie. the acting is generally fantastic with hugo weaving pulling off an intimidating agent smith, laurence fishburne an incredibly charismatic mentor and keanu reeve's neo with a great character arc about believing in his abilities and just wanting to do the right thing and i love his developed relationship with trinity. cypher as well is also pretty well developed and i like how his beliefs parallel agent smith's belief about the matrix. the matrix is not perfect though. i think the second acts is a bit too exposition heavy and agent smith is sadly mostly forgotten in the 2nd act so the stakes are kind of low and i wish some of the side characters like switch were more developed, trinity doesn't do much in the 2nd act and some of the dialogue is a bit corny but it's an incredibly imaginative, well-written and exciting sci-fi action movie (a)",positive
No Name,5.0,"i just rewatched all three of these movies yesterday so now is the perfect time for me to review them. there is no doubt in my mind that the matrix is one of the greatest films ever made. the cinematography and fight coreography in this film alone inspired and defined the way that action & adventure movies were created for well over a decade. this can't be a proper critic review of the matrix if i don't bring up the notorious bullet-time sequence. while i can obviously admit that a lot of the cgi in this time looks really dated now but there are still plenty of times throughout the film, the bullet-time sequence included that are still visually stunning in their own way to this day over 20 years later. there is also a unique sense of mystery that surrounds this movie, what separates this film from it's two sequels the most is that in this movie you feel like you're a part of neo's journey. it feels like we're slowly learning and adapting to the hidden secrets within the matrix alongside him as the events of the film play out. there is also a deep sense of philosophy to this movie, it may not have been the first movie ever made to present and explore the idea that our whole world is a simulation, but this film is without question the one that did it the best. i also love the idea that real world pain applies to the matrix, once you're in it's not a care-free world where you can do whatever you want with no consequences. if you die in the matrix, you die in the real world. it gives an extra sense of intensity and stakes to the film that probably wouldn't have been there if this reality hadn't been put in place. one of my biggest complaints overall about this first film though is cypher's betrayal. i feel like it comes way too early in the movie, a lot of the characters he kills off barely got enough real screen time for the audience to really know their characters and care about them in some way before they just find themselves electrocuted to death or unplugged from the matrix. i feel like this whole movie would've been better if cypher's betrayal had either been pushed back to the actual climax of the film before neo's fight with agent smith or removed from the film entirely and instead been a major plot point of the beginning of the matrix reloaded so that we could have had the amount of time with these other side characters like tank & dozer to actually feel something when they both die along with 75% of the crew of the nebuchadnezzar. other than that and the fact that the beginning of the movie leading up to neo becoming a part of the matrix feels rushed, it kind of removes some of the mystery from the film overall. besides those tiny complaints i think this movie is phenomenal in every sense of the word and it will always be a solid 10 out of 10 in my book.",positive

No Name,2.5,"massively overrated because of its influence on film and everyone having the hots for keanu reeves despite the fact that he cannot act for his life. 2.5/5 is arguably being generous. the plot was full of holes, the characters were largely unoriginal and underdeveloped, lots of the dialogue was cringeworthy and would never be said in real life, some of the acting was awful, especially from keanu reeves, the film was too long, the gun fights were ridiculous, the costumes/props could have been better, the visual effects are now dated, and there was a horrible green tinge for half the film. the intro sequence was nonsense, it doesn't make sense how there was a ship outside of the matrix, the tech inside the ship was laughable, the emp should've destroyed things in the ship, the robots would have found the ship far earlier, there was no source of food, the character turning against his friends twist failed, the man who should have died after being electrocuted getting back up twist was also predictable, and then the last 1/3 or so devolved into non-stop action. however, the film was original, fishburne put on a good performance, the hand-to-hand combat was entertaining thanks to good choreography, the cinematography was well done and revolutionary, and the soundtrack was appropriate. a 5/5 is a perfect or near perfect film. this is far from perfect.",positive
