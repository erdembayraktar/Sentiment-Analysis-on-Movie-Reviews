No Name,0.5,boring waste of time i dont recommend,negative
No Name,5.0,god damn... this was one of the best films ive ever seen!,positive
No Name,4.5,"it’s a dark, gritty, and sometimes sad presentation of the side effects of drugs",negative
No Name,2.0,"i know it’s a very popular film, and i understand why so many people like it but i just don’t. it’s upsetting because i almost feel as if i didn’t give it a chance. i may return to this one in the future just to see my take on it then, but for now i didn’t care for it. the lady that played sara goldfarb gave a magnificent (and i’m not using that term lightly) performance. during her scenes i felt disturbed in a way that could only be described as… cringe? but it wasn’t cringe it was just shocking. only saving private ryan has gotten that kind of reaction out of me before i saw this. so that tells me i need to rewatch this film some time soon, i think i’ll really enjoy it. seeing marlon wayans in a movie other than scary movie (or just a comedy in general) made me laugh. that’s not to say he didn’t do a good job though, because he definitely did. jennifer connelly was just ok, and jared leto was decent. 2/5 stars.",positive
No Name,5.0,this movie is gut wrenching and phenomenal. i’ve never not been able to breathe at the end of a movie because of how off putting it was but the last 20 minutes leading up to it was one of the if not the best ending scene of a movie.,positive
No Name,4.5,"watched this masterpiece  on amazon.consider this as similar to magnolia or american version of trainspotting. it's dark of course the insecurity of being old resorting to prescription  medication, or younger set with hard drugs.  be prepared for the last 20 minutes so.much going on especially the shock treatment part ..a refrigerator  does cast on it and throughout the movie just watch how attention  is paid to the prescription   addicts refrigerator..",negative
No Name,5.0,the feeling of lost and ruined life when wrong decisions are made. so sad and heartbreaking. movie is a masterpiece!,negative
No Name,4.0,"« requiem for a dream » fonctionne grâce à des performances marquantes. la musique renforce la tension, tandis que les couleurs saturées et le montage dynamique illustrent avec brio la chute (la dépendance) des personnages.",neutral
No Name,3.0,"it was a very heavy movie, i like movies like this, but in the end, there were some very ridiculous scenes and unnecessary scenes, but there were quality scenes, i can't say it was a very bad and disgusting movie, but it was very high quality and i can't say it was great either, it had good quality scenes, there were also empty and unnecessary scenes, but the director was really in the movie. he exaggerated things a lot, i can't say it was bad or good, but i can say that it was one of the most beautiful movie soundtracks i have ever seen.",negative
No Name,5.0,very good in a disturbing way,positive
No Name,4.5,"definitely a very strong movie. one of those movies that exceeds expectations, the ending is so tragic, profound and fits perfectly with what was expected. if you haven't seen it, it will depend a lot on the impact that this type of story has on you. but nothing will ever deny that it's beautiful.",positive
No Name,4.0,жоский  фильм 8.9/10,neutral
No Name,5.0,"a dark, gritty masterpiece. darren aronofsky made a once in a career film with requiem for a dream. i've never seen anything quite like it, before or since. it is superbly acted, very well directed and masterfully edited. it takes you places you likely don't want to visit. the good news is, it's just a movie. a movie most definitely worth watching. i highly recommend.   97/100",positive
No Name,5.0,"a character deconstruction of addiction done altman style that is also an all time classic. one of the first things you notice is the creative tour de france of editing techniques. while this is jumpy with no one characer dominating the others, it never feels unfocused, bloated, meandering, or obnoxious with more style than substance. in fact it's got both. the editing really compliments the pacing perfectly and compensates for so many different storylines. it's a very rare case where the editing really makes this work. it uses music video techniques but unlike a lot of others around this time that try that, it doesn't feel dated at all. it comes off as surreal more than anything and really fits with the subject matter. the acting is first rate and really builds as this progresses to the climatic consequences of all the characters actions. ellen burstyn is amazing and is the best of all fo them. even though her story is arguably the most isolated of all four it's not any less fasinating and a real testament to ehr acting ability. it's brutal to watch and fasinating. shot in a masterfully surreal way that again never feels showy but really amplifies the dazed and confused atmosphere of the subject matter. it's like a comprehensive apocalypse now for drug addiction on all sides of the trade. everyone who has a strong stomach should give this a try once. if your familiar with the director than it helps going in knowing if you can handle it.",positive
No Name,4.0,"a very intense and rough watch, requiem for a dream is one of the most heartbreaking films i've ever seen. it's not just a depressing film, i really felt attached to all of the characters, and that makes it all the more sad what happens to them. this is a film that i found amazing, but that i might not want to go through again.",positive
No Name,3.5,in an intense look into drug use and the effects it can have on your life. the editing is definitely top tier.,positive
No Name,1.0,dude honestly this is one of the most overrated movies of all time. like wayyyy too much grandma storyline. maybe my expectations were too high bc of how highly ppl regard this movie but i never write reviews either and this one honestly had to be said. wish i didnt waste my time,positive
No Name,5.0,"if you've been there, this movie will remind you why you left that life behind... unbelievable film. 5/5",negative
No Name,3.5,"it's a well-made and captivating movie. but it's not an easy watch. you will leave this movie feeling very uncomfortable and sad. but not in a good way. i felt really icky after watching this movie. still, the script is incredibly compelling, and it deserves the recognition that it received. however, i kinda wish that i never watched it.",positive
No Name,4.0,this slow burn will make your skin crawl by the end. it's depiction of 4 people's descent into madness is unsettling and striking to say the least.,negative
No Name,5.0,very familiar stories,positive
No Name,5.0,"masterpiece, genius. 11/10 i loved this film! however this is traumatic!",positive
No Name,2.5,"it’s well made from a technical standpoint, but i just can’t endorse this movie's overly disturbing take on the bad that can come from drug use. the characters are one dimensional and merely exist just to be tortured",negative
No Name,4.0,"hard watch, that's for sure. ellen b and jared leto acting phenomenal. cringey in parts, his arm. don't think i'll watch it again though, once is enough.",positive
No Name,1.0,"this really is pretentious to the nth degree. ellen burstyn did a great job, i'll give you that. but the film ( sorry movie) is so far up it's own *ss, it doesn't know whether it's coming or going. it's doesn't help that it has jared leto in it, because he just adds to the pretentiousness somewwhat. hard hitting, hard to watch, so can only do once. come on, it's not that bad! people need to watch trainspotting. because it has humour, so when the hard hitting moments come, they make so much more impact.",negative
No Name,5.0,"unflinching, hard to watch, though an absolute must-watch, ""requiem for a dream"" is a gut-wrenchingly horrific look into the dangers of substance abuse that gets its point across a little too well. phenomenal acting and a powerful script help elevate the movie as well, though it really is the overall message that gets imprinted into your brain. genuinely one of the most disturbing watches i've seen to date, but an absolutely necessary one to watch at least (and possibly most) once.",positive
No Name,4.0,"wow, i kept putting this movie off as i thought it was going to be slow, depressing and hard to get through but i was wrong this movie kept me glued to my seat. i am glad i gave it a try.",negative

No Name,5.0,"absolute cinema! ele é bem pesado. consegue te deixar bem desconfortável durante o filme. vc realmente consegue sentir ele. a música é fenômeno, o som é fenômeno, a atuação tbm e aquele jogo de cortes rápidos mostrando o isqueiro borbulhando (fast cuts and close ups) é absurdo!",positive

No Name,3.5,you can truly feel the agony of the characters for 23 hours of their day in search of the feeling in that 24th.,neutral
No Name,4.5,"combining top notch performances (particularly from ellen burstyn), strong subject matter, frenetic cinematography and a memorable musical score from clint mansell, darren aronofsky's requiem for a dream provides a haunting and intense look into drug addiction, broken dreams, isolation and despair. it's not one for repeated viewing though.",positive
No Name,4.0,definitely a hard movie to watch. depressing but at the same time a great way to get a message across. 7.7/10,negative
No Name,4.0,"requiem for a dream is definitely not for everyone, with it's bleak and sorrow nature, however it's worthwhile with it's unique storytelling and message about the horrors of drug addiction",negative
No Name,5.0,never watching this again btw,neutral
No Name,4.5,a gut-wrenching & unforgiving tale of substance abuse that will leave an impression on you to say the least. the perfect pacing & clever cinematography only add to the haunting tone of this movie.,positive
No Name,5.0,so harrowing! brilliant acting … jared never fails! i first watched this when it came out and i'm still recovering .. the ending stays with you that's for sure!!,positive
No Name,5.0,everyone should watch this so they can really know how illegal drugs can destroy lives.,negative

No Name,5.0,visually stunning. awesome cinematography. a harrowing look at the depths that addiction can drag people down to.,positive
No Name,5.0,"beware!you will not ever forget this movie, it shows perfectly all the complications of human nature and relationships, but it gives us an insight into the complicated relationship between addiction and love that most of us try to blind ourselves from.",positive
No Name,4.5,the movie is both amazing and disturbing. they've done a really good job at displaying the lives of addicts. it really makes you think about life and i think that everyone has to watch this movie.,positive
No Name,4.0,"damn, i feel very sorry now",negative
No Name,5.0,"great acting! put jennifer connelly on the map as a serious actor, imo",positive
No Name,5.0,"a true masterpiece which should be shown to teenagers as educational material in a fight against drug use. the pacing of the movie is absolutely perfect. connection with the characters is so good that i've almost felt physical pain at the end of the movie. in fact, the best way to describe the feeling i've got after watching it is - being hit in the face by a brick. it's one of the rare movies which brings you in its world and connects you to the characters, their hopes, dreams and ultimate demise to the point where you feel physical relief after it ends and you get back to your own life. and it's not because the movie is bad - quite the contrary. it's eye opening. it makes you glad to have your own life, in whatever mental, social or financial state you are in. it makes colors of your real world more vibrant. it simply is a requiem for a dream in every sense of that phrase.",positive
No Name,1.5,"definitely will never understand the hype. i finally watched this and was left thinking, ""really? this is it?""",positive
No Name,5.0,"the score, the pace, the visuals, the camera work, the acting. everything was put together to make of this movie the best movie you will not watch a second time not because it is bad but because it is that good, that powerful",positive
No Name,5.0,"absolutely incredible with all around amazing performances, a haunting score, and imagery that will stick with you forever.",positive
No Name,5.0,"it is a film that can come across as disturbing to some people probably but for me it was a really well executed idea, beautiful acting from the main actors and unique but brilliant cinematography. i think some parts of the story could have been worked on or even extended but generally the feeling/atmosphere is one of the best. was finding myself wanting for more .",positive
No Name,4.0,"unfiltered, disturbing yet powerful, with graphic imagery that doesn't leave the head anytime soon. phenomenal score, great cast and some neat editing as well as cinematography. i think it's nicely structured, narrated and paced despite it being about four different characters each with their own arc. while there lacks some writing it is still beautifully directed and delivered. many scenes that were brilliantly crafted to give off the exact essence of the moment but also a few which could have been a bit more worked on. a well executed portrayal of real-life people shown as cinematic as it gets and one that doesn't shy away from ending it all as unfortunate as possible. i thank my dear friend jeff for this recommendation.",positive
No Name,5.0,"it's not a normal film; it's an experience. you can't watch it while chilling. it gives a deep, uncut vision of one of the darkest sides of human beings. nothing for weak nerves.",negative
No Name,5.0,the last 20-15 minutes of the movie me cry for a good hour afterwards. safe to say i'm never touching drugs in my life holy hell,positive

No Name,4.5,this movie is truly something. i had heard spoilers of the movie scenes and the ending and i still cried when i watched it. one of favourite movies honestly 😙👌,positive
No Name,3.5,despair without redemption. the subject matter is very dark. the editing & score are irritatingly repetitive yet mesmerizing. the plot is thin with missed opportunities but the unique vision is captured.,negative
No Name,5.0,"at first the movie doesn't seem like it is going anywhere until it continues to escalate. eventually reaching one of the best climaxes in cinematic history. it's a very depressing movie, but it will leave you in shock and awe after it is over.",positive
No Name,3.0,pretty hard to watch disturbing drug movie well acted and shot but its so depressing worth watching once makes you think but some will find it too disturbing.,negative
No Name,4.0,one of the most uncomfortable movies ive ever watched. wasnt a bad movie ill just never watch it again.,negative
No Name,4.0,"failure is a scary thing; everyone fears it one way or another. requiem for a dream hones its themes on this, and is greatly enhanced through a talented cast, this is one seriously depressing ride.",positive
No Name,4.5,the camerawork is great，the music is the same,neutral
No Name,5.0,"i love the theme, and i love the cinematography. i think all of the actors did a great job! i've already seen this a few times. i'm not sure why some people say they can only stomach seeing it once. while the film is somewhat dark, i consider it a masterpiece that's worth seeing several times.",positive
No Name,3.0,"6.0/10- i’m not grading this from a cinematic standpoint, but from a “that was so disturbing you couldn’t pay me to watch it again” standpoint",negative
No Name,5.0,the masterpiece of darren aronofsky!,neutral

No Name,3.5,amazing performance by ellen burstyn,positive
No Name,5.0,one of my favorite movie ever. addiction is perfectly depicted by main characters slowly turning into monsters.,positive
No Name,5.0,"all time favorite movie, watched many times. the movie is very sad and while it definitely can seem out of touch with reality. i think the portrayals of the tragedies it focuses are depicted with the seriousness deserved. i appreciated certain creative decisions for example the slang/jive ty and harry use while i have never heard the slang words used outside this movie they are easily understood with context clues and give it a timeless feel - movie specific slang shouldn't become outdated so to speak.",positive
No Name,4.0,"darren aronofsky's requiem for a dream is a harrowing look at addiction and obsession.  sara goldfarb's (ellen burstyn) universe exists primarily within her brooklyn apartment where, fueled by amphetamines, she obsesses about appearing on television.  meanwhile, her son harry (jared leto), accompanied by his girlfriend (jennifer connelly) and his best friend (marlon wayans), spend their days looking to score their next fix of heroin.  it is a nightmarish vision from the start as the characters slowly but inevitably descend into a world of horrifying physical and mental pain, psychosis, surreal hallucinations, and the reality that there is no escape.  while aronofsky's outlandish style is sometimes unnecessarily distracting, the movie is buoyed by some stark and memorable imagery, a remarkable score by aronofsky regular clint mansell, and what could just be burstyn's career-defining performance.",positive
No Name,2.5,"tasteless, dull junkie mess... what am i watching?",negative
No Name,5.0,the best acting performance from ellen burstyn! with the best editing ever done in a movie!,positive
No Name,5.0,a once in lifetime experience.,neutral
No Name,5.0,"one of the best depictions of addiction ever put to film. every character is dealing with their own addiciton to something, and it really hammers home that the ones who fall to addiciton often just are victims.",positive
No Name,5.0,"it was absolutely amazing. proof that simple problems that create simple plot lines work really well. the soundtrack was one of the most amazing ones i have ever seen in a movie. the acting was amazing as well, and the topic is masterly explored. it is a movie that doesn't have a single heart-warming moment, and that is perfect considering the dark and raw atmosphere that they were trying (and successfully did) to create. drugs can really mess you up, and this movie portrays that in a beautiful way. these four people end up in a worse and darker place by the time everything is said and done. this film takes us to a journey where we can see the addicts going from less to more, going to extreme extents to get their merchandise, and at the same time we are witnesses of their descent to insanity.  another thing i want to point out is the photography. outstanding. the way this movie uses it's cameras is astonishing. yet again, simple but incredibly effective shots result from this work of art. this movie will raise your tension and feel the desperation from the characters. it will amaze you with its beautiful scenes and unique atmosphere. it is simple. it is intense. it is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen, without a doubt.",positive
No Name,3.5,"depressing movie, well done but lacking anything pleasant.",positive
No Name,3.5,this...is one heck of a difficult film to review. you won't enjoy yourself. you're not supposed to. aronofsky is unflinching in driving home the horrors of drug abuse - but his stylish direction distracts from as much as it enhances that goal.,positive
No Name,4.0,"que trauma. se la recomiendo a todos y no se la recomiendo a nadie. en serio es una película +18 pero no por la violencia o sexualidad, sino por la carga de realidad tan impactante.",neutral
No Name,5.0,one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. brutally real. an unforgettable watch that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits roll.,positive
No Name,3.5,"a deeply disturbing film -- showing graphically the effect dope has on four people's lives. all four are involved in personal relationships with each other. dope is the catalyst but the real evil is society -- dreams that are promised and cannot be fulfilled by four inadequate people. moreover, the way society treats its failures is gut-wrenchingly depicted. absolutely not for the faint-hearted, not even sure myself whether i benefitted from watching it.",negative
No Name,4.5,"the editing and cinematography of this movie are absolutely riveting, and aronofsky's direction is truly a work of art. the messages this movie displays are yet to age and the actors are firing on all cilinders. for people saying it's too dark, depressing and has no business existing, go watch dr. dolittle 2 for the 98th time!",negative
No Name,4.0,"the pace is frenetic.  that put me off at first, but once i caught up with the rhythm i enjoyed the film.  ellen burstyn is terrific.",positive
No Name,4.5,"this movie is incredibly disturbing and depressing, however, you will never forget it. amazing cinematography and artistically thought out plot.",negative
No Name,5.0,i'm never watching that again,neutral
No Name,4.5,"as a young filmmaker this movie left an imprint.  this film made the camera a stylistic element beyond anything that had been done before.  sure yes,  other great masterpieces of cinema contained great portraits capture in motion, but rarely was the motion used to repeatedly tell the story.   this is where requiem for a dream shines, the use of the camera to tell the simplest of stories, one of vice, and pain and fear, and love and joy which barely slipped through our fingers.  before the main characters have yet to live they are seeking death.  their parents, and their parents parents doing the same, except not through existential foes, but actual others, looking to submit to existence with slow death.  not by drugs, but by war, or the misery of the knowledge of what one could have been.  don't could have been is the story of this movie, summarized by lifes transposed onto drugs and violence.  all the choices of the characters no matter their prior circumstances.",positive
No Name,4.5,this is really a screwed up movie it's kinda sad but it's a great movie. it's all about drugs and how they ruin your life. well the son is a heroin addict along with his girl and his best friend. and they figure out a way to make money and able to support their habit but in the long run things just get really bad for them. now one of the dope fiends mother tries to go on a diet and it doesn't work out so she sees a doctor and they put her on uppers. so she can eat as much as she wants and lose weight. and when she starts out taking them they make her feel really good until her body gets immune to them and then she starts craving the high and she becomes a total mess. the whole movie is great but everything gets screwed up,positive
No Name,5.0,"really powerful story, definitely one of the most powerful movies out there.",positive
No Name,1.5,"sad, depressing, gross, on and on. yes, drugs damage and kill. we know that. what's the point of putting this offensive mess in people's faces? other than the good acting, this film has no merit and no need to be made.",negative

No Name,5.0,"a work of art! what a beautiful tragic film. excellent cinematography. fine, fine cast! i couldn't take my eyes off it. a must watch.",positive
No Name,4.0,"not a movie you will watch over a billion times, more of an educational movie dealing with the levels of addiction, mental illnes,s and drug abuse.",positive
No Name,4.5,"in this twisted aronofsky flick, four individuals pursue love and adoration in various ways. their changing lifestyles lead them down a rapid road of addiction, crime, insanity, and greed. aronofsky's examination of the dreadful and long-lasting effects that these can have on human beings is agonizingly thrilling— possibly unendurable for some. still, the dramatic thriller was executed very well and the acting was efficacious. it's mind-boggling, tragic, graphic, absolutely shuttering, but above all, realistic. i enjoyed the eeriness and the darkness of the film, but it was made to leave a sour taste in our mouths and darren aronofsky delivered.  for the bold and disturbed, i recommend you give it a night-watch. for the more squeamish movie-goers and strangers to the psychological thriller genre, i strongly caution… 88%!",positive

No Name,4.0,"a shocking and punching movie that you'll never forget. you see the dreams of each and everyone of the characters be canceled by this drug and it absolutely pushes you away from this. it is a really good way to give a life lesson to people of 15-18 that watches this. never start because you may be like them. the story of the four characters were tragic but you just wanted them to succeed and that is why i love this movie. the story is perfect and the acting makes the movie more watchable. after this, the original soundtrack of this movie is unforgettable, splendid. i just didn't like that much the repetitive use of little sequences before they take drug or something. i don't know how to call it, but it was a bit too much. a really good movie and a must see.",positive

No Name,4.5,"requiem for a dream is an interesting psychological drama film about drug use. american director darren aronofsky successfully portrays the drug addiction of the four protagonists and its consequences on their physical and emotional state. the interpretations of ellen burstyn, jared leto, jennifer connelly, and marlon wayans are remarkable and, in particular, that of burstyn, who manages to completely fit into her character. the film also features the extensive use of short cuts, split scenes, and very tight close-ups. finally, the movie soundtrack composed by clint mansell, and which includes the famous track lux aeterna, is simply extraordinary and is a fundamental component of the film. one of the best movies about drug addiction.",positive
No Name,4.0,"a visceral and uncomfortable viewing, but not one to be missed. requiem won’t be for everyone, but it examines an ugly side of human nature and the unfortunate consequences of addiction in a blisteringly chilling way. the performances were excellent and the commitment was real. it’s not a particularly re-watchable film, but it’s a cult classic to add to the list",negative
No Name,4.0,this illustrates the devastating nature & consequences of addiction...,negative
No Name,3.5,"an interesting movie that didn't hit me as hard or intense as it may others. the film portrays the descent into addiction of four related but different individuals. while it's supposed to be an emotional and psychological thriller, it didn't necessarily bring out those feelings in me. i felt bad for the characters and their decision making skills but the progression of the story moved too quickly at times for me to build strong connections with those involved. however, the performances are tragically beautiful and the story is tragically bleak. the portrayal of drugs and its effect on the lives of its users and others around them is the central point and in that sense the film succeeds. nonetheless, this film will hit harder to those who've been affected by the subject matter or have knowledge on the topic.",positive
No Name,4.5,"requiem for a dream shows excellent performances twisted in a world of addiction and struggle. it is at times hard to watch but it shows the reality of addiciton with tough scenes and memorable performances. it's a movie you'd probably only watch once, but you will remember it for a long time.",positive

""requiem for a dream"" is a movie of four americans who have fallen from power. they have no bright future but resort to stimulants. when sara hoped to find a way out of chemical happiness, for her son harry, his girlfriend marian and friend tyrone, she also got used too the pills and even mother sara goldfarb fell into a downward spiral. at the beginning of the film, she still tried to guide the child on the right path by tying the tv he wanted to sell to the radiator, but when a rogue nutritionist confessed to a somewhat neurotic sixty-year-old that she might lose weight, because of the pills she didn't want to stop taking them and got addicted. the movie focuses on the lives of the residents of coney island, and the film shows the consequences of addiction and obsession and how obsession leads to addiction. by playing with different camera angles and the smooth editing work, a special film experience is created. just like the audience has experienced the pain of various characters.  jared leto convincingly plays the role of drug addict harry goldfarb, and he will do his best to get the last batch of heroin. but money is a problem. he has no choice but to force his addict girlfriend marion into prostitution, and the latter is a brilliant role played by jennifer connelly. his good friend tyrone, played by marlon wayans, also tried to control his addiction, but his efforts were in vain. when friends were struggling with addiction, harry's mother sara was glued to the tube when she called for contestants on her favorite tv show. she is determined to participate, but needs to lose a few pounds to wear her favorite clothes. her obsession with television made her addicted to drugs that can speed up the weight loss process. but the result was disastrous, and sara slowly and surely seemed to lose control of reality. the exorcist actress ellen burstyn played a very good role. ""requiem for a dream'' is a drama film that makes you think, but also gives you a bad feeling. the film clearly shows how strong an addiction can be. but also how strong an obsession can be and that this can lead to rash choices with disastrous consequences. requiem for a dream is, for me, the example of a good film that i never need to see again. it made me quite depressed. with this masterpiece, he impressed me as a viewer.",positive

No Name,4.5,"rating: a-   director: darren aronofsky  requiem for a dream is a film that's nothing for the faint hearted. the four leads are really good, considering  that the film has only very little minor characters, ellen burstyn is definitely the standout right here. the style and cinematography are good and they try to do a lot with split screens and pulling the fantastic score throughout the entire movie. in one sentence, this is a masterpiece but i'll never ever want to watch it again.",positive
No Name,5.0,"a masterpiece that doesn't hold back and doesn't care if the audience is okay with that decision or not. that's what makes it a true legend in the world of film; once seen, unable to be forgotten. a movie that stays with you forever and perhaps was a bit ahead of its time so far as the extreme nature through which its subject matter of addiction and subsequent downward spiral is displayed, resulting in everything from the perfect technical aspects of score to cinematography and editing, all the way up to the acting talent on display from the four leads, who are arguably two leads (leto and burstyn) and two supporters (connelly and waynes), all of whom could and should have been nominated for their performances, all of whom carried their weight, and when combined resulted in one of the most gut wrenching, unforgettable, real, true, horrific, and polarizing movies of a generation. there's just simply no other movie like requiem for a dream.",positive

No Name,4.0,"""in the end it's all nice.""  i've put off watching ""requiem for a dream"" for forever given the grim subject matter. a recent re-review by jeremy jahns motivated me to finally watch it.  and hoo-boy, what a bleak and brutal masterpiece.  it's clearly darron aronofsky's best and most compelling work. the acting is phenomenal. the editing, cinematography, and filming style is just amazing and innovative. the way he brings to life four different character arcs such that we care about each and everyone of them shows an artist who is a master at his craft.  for some reason i didn't have the passionate reaction to this as the many fans/critics that absolutely adore the movie. this may be a generational issue.  trainspotting was more to my personal liking which i think has to do with the soundtrack which for me really elevated it to a more re-watchable film. trainspotting may have more comedy, but it can get super dark as well (the baby scene).  ultimately, this is clearly a movie classic that will stand the test of time.",positive
No Name,4.5,"one of the most terrifying films i have ever seen, if not the most terrifying. requiem of a dream takes a deep unpolished dive into the physical and psychological ramifications of drug abuse. this superb film will leave you in utter despair at even the thought of consuming recreational drugs and is a must watch!",neutral

No Name,4.5,"this is darren aronofsky's 2nd movie. so it made sense for him to tackle a subject like this one near the new millennium. it's his trippy spiral into drug addiction.  jennifer connelly, keith david, a young jared leto, and i forgot marlon wayans was in this. 3 characters; a young couple and an elderly woman begin to feel the rush but also the downside of taking these supplements.  20 years later and it's still a highly styled product of its era, its hopped-up editing schemes and plethora of lens choices and gimmicks a glossy refinement of 90s indie aesthetics and tarantino-patented extremity. might not be everyone's taste but it's a creative example of a filmmakers vision. the 1978 novel was grimly forensic in detailing the physical and mental destruction wrought by drug addiction.  the movie also has one of the most memorable scores ever. wonderful performances and such bleak imagery are impressive. good cutting edge indie filmmaking with its split screen style and extreme closeups.  it says we're all vulnerable to some manner of addiction, and legal ones aren't necessarily safer or less ruinous than their underworld counterparts. the movie vividly evokes the sensation of what drugs actually do to your system, briefly for better and mostly for worse, from twitchy initial rush through to comedown and tortured aftermath. it all boils down to just saying no. aronofsky pushes his limits with this plot and it's probably a good thing he did setting the bar for future storytellers.",positive
No Name,4.0,"difficult to watch but a well-told story and well-made movie. all the main actors do a great job of conveying the slippery slope of drug addiction, even for well-intended reasons. more relevant today with prescription drug addiction on the rise as well as ice and other drugs. warning: does not have a happy ending.",positive

No Name,5.0,"there comes a time in everyone's life where they are presented with something that fundamentally shifts their outlook on the nature of mankind. this film is one of those examples. to put it simply, this is a movie about the destructive power of drug abuse. but below the surface, requiem is so much deeper. this is a film about the depravity of humanity. this is a film about the lengths man will go to when their mind is not right. this is a film that will make you question whether there is hope for the future of the human race. the imagery is visceral beyond anything one could describe. it is one thing to have gruesome physical content, but the true power of this masterpiece comes in the outstanding performances of its cast. anyone who has struggled with their own mind, even in the slightest of ways, can glean something from this work. it is not for the faint of heart. be warned: this movie will make you depressed.",negative
No Name,4.0,"this is what you get when very talented people decide to do a semi-realistic picture of the worst possible outcome for every character in the movie. william shakespeare's review of this film would probably read, ""now that's what i call a tragedy! everyone we care about either dies or faces a horrible future!"" what makes this movie special is love. we, the audience grow to love these characters. they are presented to us as good people. they love each other. there's not a 'bad' person in the crowd. if ellen burstyn was your apartment neighbor you would be glad to say hi to her when you saw her in the hall. the teenage protagonist loves his mother and just wants a great life for her. for himself, for his friend, and for his pretty girlfriend. everybody just loves everybody else!  if they  were selfish arses or just dealing drugs for money, you could think to yourself, ""well, they got what they deserved!""  but the film's characters didn't get what they deserve. they got worse than they deserve. should your life be ruined forever just for wanting some fun out of life? the mother just wants to be on tv so she can be ""somebody special"" to her friends. otherwise, without a man, or other interests, she has nothing to live for or look forward to. i believe that all of us know that life just ain't supposed to be like that. the penalty for stepping over the line shouldn't be what all of these characters get. i can't stop watching this movie. but i have to tell you that i look away from the screen in some parts. i am silently shouting at the screen, ""no! no! that person does not deserve that! have mercy on them!"" but in this movie, the quality of mercy is strained.",positive

No Name,2.0,"aronofsky shows his touch early in his career; it felt like a sort of sequel to ""pi,"" with much of the same camerawork, four (instead of one) disturbed characters, and a sort of meandering to an ending that is more message than story.  some of its themes or points are pretty obvious and hit way on the head far too often and too hard; burstyn's character and story was overly pathetic and not very profound.",negative

No Name,3.0,ellen burstyn is one of the best living actresses and her performance is worth the watch even if the film was way too odd for me.,positive
No Name,4.5,"in my opinion, this is aronofsky's best film, by far. dark, real, and grim, and featuring a top 3 performance by an actress i've ever seen in ellen burstyn.",positive
No Name,4.0,"burstyn is an absolute tour de force in this film, what a transformative performance. every cast member does a strong turn, but she is the unparalleled standout, accompanied by a major surprise in the form of an unexpectedly good performance from wayans (who i was unaware had performed in any serious dramas at all). the film's notorious intensity was definitely a driving factor preventing me from seeing this film at some point in the previous two decades, but now having seen it i would describe the film more as exceptionally uncomfortable than unpalatable, gradually building up pressure before ultimately allowing the pot to boil over (characteristic of aronofsky). the film's take on psychological surrealism and induced delusion is great; parents, don't rely on mcgruff the crime dog to tell your kids not to do drugs, just show them requiem for a dream. (4/5)",positive
No Name,5.0,"requiem for a dream is written and directed by darren aronofsky based on the book with the same name written by hurbert shelby jr. this film is the story about 4 individual lives and their addictions. one of them played by ellen burstyn gets addicted to diet pills when she is invited on a game show and must slim down in order to fit into a dress she so desperately wants to wear and also to look good. her son played by jared leto who is addicted to a lot of things mainly heroine starts up a business with his girlfriend played by jennifer connelly and his best friend played by marlon wayans where they get drugs and sell it to make profit. and as the year for each individual drug induced person goes on things start getting worse and worse as the drugs take over their health and life.   requiem for a dream is one of those films that will never escape me and for whoever watches the film i guarantee that it won't leave the mind as well. through this entire runtime my eyes were glued to the screen for beginning, middle and end. once in a while i'd think to myself man i am really invested in this film. this film garners your attention and never lets up. which is an aspect that i think people might not like but we'll get to that in a little bit. from the incredible pacing i was on the edge of my seat the entire time and never found myself attention-less. requiem for a dream is an phenomenal piece of cinema that will go down in film history as possibly one if not the nightmarish and disturbing films ever created. and it is by far one of the best films that i have ever seen. now that might seem very daunting because of the subject matter of the film but i don't know. not thinking about that subject matter there's something very intriguing about this film that i can't not stop thinking about.   darren aronofsky has crafted such a unique and creative tale of misery and sadness that in a way just seems so perfect. the way the story is told and how the editing plays a major part of the film from editor jay rabinowitz. including the shots and cinematography from director darren aronofsky and cinematography matthew libatique giving the atmosphere of the film its claustrophobic and disturbing experience. from the nightmarish scenes involving their hallucinations to the drugs they take to moments of consequences they have to endear. also trying not to forget to mention but the fantastic and nerve racking score from clint mansell giving the film another bump of adrenaline and absolute menace. this might be my favorite darren aronofsky film ever and to be far i haven't seen all of his films yet but man i don't think with an experience like this one will be beaten by any of his other films to tell the truth. he did an amazing job at directing this including writing this. it's very unpredictable there was even a moment in the film after i was halfway through it that i decided i can't predict anything out of this film which is something that i really enjoy from a film. you also get why they do this, they're not just stereotypical junkies, they have motives and reasons why they do the drugs.   which leave me to the performances from our 4 main characters. right off the bat i'm debating if i like jared leto more in this or in dallas buyers club. he was terrific in this film. jennifer connelly is an actress i'd like to watch more of because man she was also fantastic in this film as the girlfriend of jared leto's character. marlon wayans as jared leto's best friend was also really great in the film which i didn't expect at all but he did really well. but my favorite performance throughout this film was ellen burstyn. out of all of them i felt more for her than anyone. but not to say that i didn't really feel bad for anyone else, i most certainly felt bad for everyone but ellen's performance i felt just more sympathetic for. from the beginning and end you can see the drastic change in her after going to far with the drugs she takes which was just heart breaking. there's also one scene where i just thought this is by far one of the best actress acting scenes i have ever seen ever. she was freaking phenomenal in this film. now for all of them just mentioning it briefly but there is one sequence that had my mouth in ah and could not look away. a sequence that made me realize what an uplifting experience this entire film has been.   coming back to what i mentioned before this film will tear you to pieces with its editing, storytelling and subject matter. also it's aspect of claustrophobia. and i will be fully understandable if this subject matter is something you or anyone else can't handle. i would never recommend watching this film ever if you feel that way about the subject matter. trying not to be super dramatic but it's the truth. darren aronofsky understands the subject matter and throws his own unique spin on it giving it a very disturbing and very sad experience and is also a film and has also been deemed a film that no one should watch on a second viewing and it's the absolute truth. this is no blockbuster you can watch over and over again and be entertained by, this is a grounded dark tale that will already never leave your mind because of how it is. all in all if you can handle this subject matter i'd watch it for the experience and be done with it.  or if you're like me you might really like it but who knows. and another thing worth noting is this film is not trying to promote addiction. this is a film that a wanna be junkie will watch and probably will never want to do drugs ever. that's how terrifying this film is.   requiem for a dream is one of the best and one if not the most disturbing and upsetting film i have ever seen in my life and i gonna give it a 10/10.  thank you so much for reading look forward to more reviews very soon.",positive

No Name,3.0,"the cinematic height of a health problematic film that health classes would present as clearly visualized warning about what would drugs do to you is no exaggeration as darren aronofsky was headstrong in his disturbingly honest approach that guarantees sickness, to a puking extent if never looked away, and apathy for the hopelessly unlikable characters sealing, or in their cases injecting, their fates from resulted downward spiral of addictions that disregard living. even though the characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, pathetically disgusting addictions, the cast performed well in getting through especially the young trio building up their stardom at the time. only one communication found common sense through leto's performance in one scene with words his character should have listened to and additionally become a hypocritical drug addict, which is a brutalized truth that people using drugs are arrogantly ignorant of the dangers posed against their well-beings – and that shows how aronofsky should've gone further in communication rather than focusing on the depressing spiral. fairly praiseworthy on the aesthetics through the cinematography and acceptable surrealism despite the discomfort, but how can it be rated into the like if it's not enjoyable? if you ever watch this film, whether nighttime or not, immediately follow it with a more positive film, doesn't matter if it's a good one or a bad one, just to get rid of what your eyes just tasted.

No Name,3.5,"oof.  after bursting onto the scene with the bleak and unforgiving directorial debut that was ""pi,"" darren aronofsky followed it up by tapping into the bibliography of author hubert selby jr. and crafting this cinematic equivalent of one basically saying ""you ain't seen nothing yet."" as far as cinematic sack taps go, ""requiem for a dream"" isn't necessarily the most severe. but, dear god, is it going to be a massive buzzkill to whatever the hell you had going on in your life. as a visual experience, it is simply exhausting, but it's not all for naught. many critics cite aronofsky's provocative filmmaking style to be a bit excessive, if not obvious or lacking in finesse. and though i might find this critique to be true in some cases (i.e. ""mother!""), i think ""requiem for a dream"" might be that rare case where i couldn't see any other approach doing the story justice. this is a movie that hits that ""best of both worlds"" zone of provocateur filmmaking, where the product ultimately ends up being unnerving and difficult, yes, but also thought-provoking and called for.   do i ever want to see it again? not really, no. but, man, did ellen burstyn ever deliver a career-defining performance, if i ever saw one.",positive

No Name,5.0,"a daunting nightmare spiral of addiction.  darren aronofsky's mad drug fueled nightmare journeys the audience through the lives of 4 addicts of various substances. it is split into seasons starting with summer, then fall, winter, and ends in spring. i will be completely honest and say that it does have its faults. it can lack the subtlety of more mature films in its dialogue and appearance. however, this film is a collection of sequenced art scenes that are gorgeous in how haunting they become. in the end, you may be traumatized like so many that have viewed this film, but requiem for a dream will leave you thinking and disturbed. i can guarantee that much.  jared leto is a harrowing heroin addict. one of his best acting performances other than dallas buyer's club. he oozes desperation for a fix exponentially throughout the film's duration. jennifer connelly is so sympathetic, you just feel worse and worse for her character for what she does for love, acceptance, and drugs. marlon wayans is more about making his place in the world with money and heroin dealing. you see his sad past lead to a broken future. ellen burstyn is perhaps the most underrated performance in requiem for a dream. her addiction seems to be sugar, then you realize its television. her obsession with watching leads her to ruination.  in short, aronofsky demonizes substance abuse, but takes care in showing the downward spiral of addiction is the most exaggerated, but poignant way he knows. the cinematography will dazzle and terrify you. clint mansell's legendary and now infamous score will haunt you for the rest of your days. darren aronofsky's mad masterpiece is a demonstration of film making with innovative edits, cuts, synchronization, musical swells, and deranged sequencing. nearly every scene is shot differently. it's a very interesting movie to look at in that i doubt you will be bored.  check out darren aronofsky's unhinged film requiem for a dream if you dare. you have been warned.",positive

No Name,3.5,"it's clear that darren aronofsky didn't want to make something new and special in the characters' arcs or the story, but he wanted to put you in the shoes of the characters with his creative use of visuals and sounds, and he succeeded.... kinda!    thanks to aronofsky's direction that harmonized surreal visuals and sounds with the characters' feelings and experiences, i found myself experiencing and feeling what the characters experience and feel while watching the movie. due to that, this is without a doubt one of the most disturbing and intoxicating movies i've ever watched.   the problem is that the dramatic aspect in the movie actually harmed the movie; the dramatic scenes at the end of the first act slowed the pace of the movie down. it's not the only or the major issue i've with this movie. the real issue is that the creative direction that elevated the stereotypical arc of sara goldfarb, wasn't enough to do this with the stereotypical arc of harry and marion. also, the oscar-worthy performance by ellen burstyn (i really wanna know how she didn't win an oscar) and a few complications in her character, sara goldfarb's part was way better and more compelling than harry and marion's. i really didn't found myself relate to the characters of harry and marion so much, despite the great performances that jared leto and jennifer connelly gave. the perfect example that can affirm that the dramatic aspect wasn't the most powerful thing in the movie is the character of tyrone; it's a very bland character and it was very hard for me to relate to its subplot, marlon wayans was very good though.    i love requiem for a dream. it's a movie to experience not to watch. it really proves that darren aronofsky is a real talent that with his artistic direction can easily mess with your mind.

No Name,4.5,"requiem for a dream (2000), directed by darren aronofsky, kind of makes you wonder about the filmmaker's past, and just what spurred him to make a movie as dark and depressing as this. it practically screams ""don't do drugs, kids!"" but it does so in the artsy kind of way that keeps you enthralled and never even approaches the area of preachy. in fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction.   ranging from three of the seasons, summer to fall to ultimately winter, the film represents how the characters' lives get darker and colder with each season that progresses. obviously, summer being the brightest and warmest, and winter being the darkest and coldest.  addiction is a real thing, and throughout the film, you'll see through aronofsky's eyes the kind of effects it can (will) have on you. throw in a beautiful, melancholy score, and you get a touching motion picture that you'll never forget. i can actually hear the lux aeterna melody as i write this, but that's probably because i'm listening to it right now.  requiem for a dream hosts four main characters, ellen burstyn as sara goldfarb, a more serious than normal marlon wayans as tyrone, jennifer connelly as marion, and jared leto as harry goldfarb, who has ties with each of the other three characters (mother, friend, girlfriend). each of them is or will become addicted. and each of them meets different, yet terrible, fates in the end.  ellen burstyn brings the character of sara goldfarb to life so well that it makes me never want to grow old. starting out as a sweet, (if a little kooky) lonely old woman, her quest to become beautiful again for her game show appearance that she can't wait for causes her to become addicted to diet pills, and everything in her life spirals out of control from there.  this film is not for everyone. if you'd rather watch a feel-good movie where the protagonist(s) prevail and everybody is happy in the end, you should probably stay away from requiem for a dream. everyone else - come into this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the ride (if that's the correct phrase) that aronofsky is about to take you through.",positive

No Name,4.5,"oh boy...   oooooooh boy...  requiem for a dream is an exercise in how miserable can you make your audience without making them want to walk out, and it does that, fairly flawlessly. this darren aronofsky tragedy succeeds through strong writing, directing and powerful performances from an ensemble cast.    requiem for a dream follows four manhattan beach characters; the son played by jared leto, (dallas buyers club), his grandmother played by ellen burstyn, (the exorcist, interstellar), his girlfriend played by jennifer connely, (a beautiful mind, blood diamond), and his best friend played by marlon wayans, (white chicks, scary movie). it follows them as they each build up their hopes and dreams, only to have it torn back down again by their own personal addictions. it's like of mice and men on speed, literally, and good.   i pitch this film to everyone as a must see, it's a film you should definitely see once, and then never again! it's based on a book by hubert selby jr. who co-wrote the screenplay with aronofsky, (black swan, the wrestler), a writer famed for his understanding of that sort of low life new york culture and his skill in portraying it, and that really comes through in the film which is scuzzy beyond belief. the dialogue and syntax and slang of the characters really sell them as being in this world, an the grungy lighting, and subtly but meticulously crafted frames help. subtle beauty, maybe ang lee can learn a thing or two.   the reason requiem for a dream works so well is that before it tears them down, it builds up your relationship with the characters, gets you to empathise with them and feel for them and like them, it builds up their hopes and makes their dreams seem wonderfully possible before their falls. in fact that's literally the structure of the film, which is simple but genius, the three acts are denoted by the seasons; summer, fall, and winter. our associations with each word complimenting the acts. this character involvement would't work if it wasn't for a collection of quite outstanding performances. leto's accent is a bit ropey but you get used to it and he does everything else really well. there's one scene with a phone call that i nearly cried watching. i wanted to. wayans gives an uncharacteristically serious performance and he does it really well. when people were wondering why on earth the man behind all these shit parody movies was being invited to join the american academy i remembered requiem for a dream in which he is charismatic and empathetic. the real stand out though, is elen burstyn, who was actually oscar nominated for this movie and boy does she deserve it. by far the most complex character she gives a powerhouse performance in which she is believable but just extraordinarily brittle. again, there's a scene where leto comes to visit that's by far the most memorable scene in the film and again i nearly welled up.   in the end it's moments like those that are the key to understanding the hypnotic, mesmeric, enigmatic attraction of requiem for a dream, it has a lot of bleak imagery, and montages that will leave you traumatised but it's interspersed with moments of pathos and emotional sadness that are much more subtle and give the more traumatic sequences weight that without it would just seem gratuitous, and worse, slightly immature, using these images without any understanding of the weight they carry. however, luckily, aronofsky and selby jr. know exactly what they're doing and they do it well. it's carried off with a style, professionalism and maturity that belies that this is only aronofksy's second film, and first bigger budget one.   also, i have to mention clint mansell's beautiful, melancholy but perversely techno-influenced score, it's truly amazing.",positive

No Name,4.0,"requiem for a dream is maybe one of the most depressing and heart breaking movies in the history of cinema, featuring an old woman,  who starts doing drugs to fight back her addiction to chocolate and sweets and attend her favorite tv show unsuccessfully, whose son is a junkie like his best friend and his girlfriend.   the movie is divided in three parts: -summer, where the characters are introduced, and where aronofsky gives the audience hope about the future of them. the love between harry and marion is particularly exalted, like sara's typical widow's way to live. all the main characters underestimate their addiction to drugs as they reach their top.  -fall, where everything start crumbling. drugs take control over everyone's life.  -winter, aka the saddest part of the movie. not crying is a challenge at this point, as arronofsky great technique to create a link to all the characters makes you feel like you are part of their lives.   the movie is not perfect at all, as it features a really poor character's design, an overall repetitive pacing before the latter part, a sometimes confusing photography, but has a strong and perfect soundtrack (one of the most famous in the world), a great plot and is just so entertaining, you sometimes forget to be seeing a dvd. with trainspotting, this is the best ""don't do drugs"" movie ever, although i wouldn't recommend it to weak people as it may be one of the less enjoyable experience ever.",positive

No Name,4.0,"whilst it borders on becoming a little too 'mtv' (what that means makes sense to me, at least), 'requiem for a dream' has more than enough gusto and originality to get away with its endlessly dark and moody storytelling.  the performances are strong, though no one really stood out- likely because of the majority of the film's subdued nature. however, when it does build up burstyn delivers something memorable and fascinating.   really, it was sara goldfarb's story that kept me engaged and interested here and i think it easily made up for some of the film's weaker points. it would be very easy for a film taking itself this seriously to be nothing but a complete joke and whilst, this possibly comes somewhat close at times, it never actually ends up there and i think that's a credit to aronofsky's direction- this isn't a film trying to be cool, it's just legitimately cool at times. the way he captures frantic addictive tendencies is a real technical achievement and it makes up for some of the script's, quite generic, interpretations of these same concepts.  deserving of its cult status but still just a little too nineties if we're being honest (though i believe it's technically a film of the noughties but, facts are irrelevant).",positive

No Name,5.0,"watching requiem for a dream was an experience with lasting effects. it's the most hopeless film i've seen to date with a completely ruthless portrayal of drug addiction and the horrors associated. this is not as much due to the subject matter, but more so to how the characters' struggles are so sympathetic, and these struggles being presented with such scrutiny by darren aronofsky and the cast that is devastatingly painful to watch.  there is an unwavering sense of disgust from the opening scene, and it never lets up from there, making it the only film that i can confidently say i wanted to squirm in my seat while watching. it is an upsetting film in every sense of the word, made apparent by the emotional performances, the characters' goals in life slowly slipping through their fingers (hence the title) due to their use of drugs, and the uncomfortably close camera angles that give the viewer a cringe-inducing sense of entrapment.   it's easy to think of this film before seeing it and assume it is purely dependent on the significance of the subject matter with no substance from a filmmaking standpoint. however, if the film lacked in filmmaking, it would not be nearly as upsetting. darren aronofsky knows how to trap the viewers into the horrible events with a stellar cast, clint mansell's haunting score, and an unwavering sense of dread. this dread is made possible by how the characters are crafted. watching them abandon dignity, hold onto false hope, and stomach such disturbing situations made me almost struggle to stay seated, a feat no other film has accomplished.   one cannot talk about this film without mentioning ellen burstyn's performance. she is tied with essie davis in the babadook for my favorite performance by an actress. what they do so well is make the viewers feel such pity for their miserable lives with performances so convincing that it's easy to forget that they are actors. although burstyn outshines everyone else, jared leto, marlon wayans, and jennifer connelly are fantastic in their roles, doing what aronofsky most definitely expected them to do: make the audience feel their characters' pain.  as well as the performances, what aronofsky does technically is equally astounding. whether a director can add more layers to the story than what is on paper is what separates a mediocre director from a great one, and aronofsky proves himself to be the latter. aronofsky uses the same editing technique each time a specific character takes a specific drug, for instance. as the viewer counts the times the technique is used, they feel more and more despair as the characters addictions become gradually stronger.   *****spoilers follow*****  where his technical skills really shined for me was the final scene where he wraps up the film perfectly. he shows a montage of our characters laying down, and provides so much with this one directorial choice. all characters except that of jared leto assume the fetal position. my interpretation of this is that it's a gesture of despair, conveying a similarity between them.  the position also indicates that they are clutching the one thing that helps them take their mind off their new unbearable lives. the reason harry (jared leto) does not assume the position is that he has nothing to hold on to. every other character does, but the thing that gives them hope is what makes each character arc distinct from the others.  tyrone (marlon wayans) clutches the thought of his mother, making him the most hopeful character since he is being forcefully held from his drugs and still has thoughts of a peaceful life. although the movie shared a theme with trainspotting in conveying the frightful easiness of slipping into addiction with the story of sara (ellen burstyn), darren aronofsky himself said that tyrone is the only character with hope of escape.   marion (jennifer connelly) is similar in that she has something that gives her hope, but different in that she has completely abandoned her life. she curls herself around the heroin she went to such desperate measures to get her hands on, showing how drugs are her salvation from her new life even though they are the cause.  the film concludes with perhaps the most depressing character arc in the movie, which is that of sara goldfarb. solidifying the heart-breaking monologue she gives earlier, the thing she holds on to is the fantasy of appearing on television. she knows this will never happen, but the thought of it comforts her. within this fantasy, her son harry is implied to have married his girlfriend marion and appears well-dressed and happy. him and his mother tell each other they love each other, and the film fades to its end credits. what makes this character arc the most depressing out of all of the others is that her son's life and their relationship being healthy is within the fantasy of her appearing on television. this suggests that her son loving her and vice versa is just as outlandish as her television fantasy. that notion is emphasized further by sara smiling, but tears running down her eyes can be seen.   the way aronofsky presented the film's wrap-up is the major highlight of his directorial talents within this movie. he knew to convey more ideas visually than what is shown through dialogue and the actors' performances, making this movie's presentation of the subject matter all the more complex. although it is a film that had me emotionally drained long after seeing it, i cannot deny that it is excellently crafted.",positive

No Name,5.0,"requiem for a dream is the movie that made me decide once and for all i would not do drugs. surrounded by many movies like it such as trainspotting and the basketball diaries, this is the only one that genuinely both moved and disturbed me. it is a tough watch but definitely a movie that all people (with strong stomachs) should check out.  this movie shows drug addiction through stories about a widowed woman, played to perfection by ellen burstyn, her son harry, a great jared leto, his girlfriend marion, a good jennifer connelly, and his best friend tyrone, a spectacular marlon wayans at his best. all of these characters have a view of happiness that they are all trying to reach but addiction is getting in the way of them reaching it.  all of the performances are off the charts. every one in this movie gives it their all and it shows. the writing is great the dialogue is spot on. the direction is perfect from darren aronofsky, he really know how to make the audience feel like they are on drugs, and the cinematography is chilling, bleak, and perfect. and the score, oh my god the score, is so perfect and disturbing and fitting for this film. the sound track alone will give you chills. it really is one if the best soundtracks of all time in my opinion.  requiem for a dream is a dark disturbing tale that is not for people who are bothered by strong depictions of addiction. it makes drugs not look fun for a change. it makes you not want to do them, which it was meant to do. this movie is great, and i have no flaws with it.",positive

No Name,4.5,"a powerful and disturbing story about addiction from darren aronofsky, requiem for a dream gives us the twin tales of a mother and sons fall into linked but very different drug-fuelled nightmares. there are moments of the darkest of humour as the lives of the pair spiral out of control but the fates of both are dealt with in an unflinching and graphic manner that is cold and disturbing. ellen burstyn and jared leto lead the cast and for me, burstyn's story is probably the most heart-breaking as we see the lonely old widow become dependent on tranquillisers and slimming pills as she becomes obsessed with the chance of appearing on a low-budget tv game show. this is a hard-hitting and deeply uncomfortable movie that seems as brutally relevant today as it was when it was first made over a decade ago. the score by the brilliant clint mansell underpins the onscreen imagery perfectly and has rightly gone on to have a life of its own, being instantly recognisable. not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, this is a powerful drama from a superb filmmaker.",positive

No Name,5.0,punch in the stomach . a film that you can't unsee.,neutral
No Name,3.5,"wow, requiem for a dream is so dark and depressing. it is easily one of the most detailed looks into how drug abuse can destroy your life. aronofsky uses every trick in the director's playbook to give the audience the sensation of being affected by the addictions of the main characters. there is shaky camera work, there are dramatic focus shifts. even the music is used to create an unsettling atmosphere. it puts you on edge as a viewer, and makes it utterly impossible to relax while watching the movie. perhaps the most amazing thing to me was that the actors actually managed to make their characters sympathetic to me. there were moments where i actually wanted them to have a successful sale in order to dig themselves out of the pit they had fallen into. typically it's hard for me to identify with a movie character who continues to make the wrong decisions, but some magical combination of the script and the acting had me rooting for these people.  one of the most effective techniques that aronofsky used in this film are the repetitive smash-cut montages of each step that goes into taking drugs. it made for a really artistic way of showing how the drug abuse had become routine to the characters, and it also offered a great contrast when later ellen burstyn's character became addicted to her own drug of choice. i also enjoyed what this film had to say about people who struggle with a less toxic, but perhaps just as damaging, addiction like television. it makes you question your own life and look to see what you have grown overly attached to that might be getting in the way of more important things. the one thing about requiem for a dream that kind of holds me back from absolutely falling in love with it is that this film is exceedingly hard to watch. in fact i can't picture subjecting myself to it again, at least not for a really long time. while i do think it is amazingly well-constructed, and startlingly realistic, there's nothing that would prompt me to want to go through that again.",positive

No Name,4.0,"highly recommended to young and elderly people, or everyone with potential exposure to drug abuse. the movie brilliantly described the outcome of drug addiction behavior. portrayed lavishly in artistic manner, one may not notice the horrible hallucinogenic effect of drug prescription by any irresponsible medics.   the theme song haunts ludicrously from beginning to end, however it colored the right atmosphere the picture needs. grim, alarming, yet melancholic.   youth only come once, hence you may stumble once or few times but not to fall too deep nor steep for it may be too late to resuscitate later.",negative

No Name,3.5,"while most people see movies solely for entertainment value, several of us actually welcome a challenge. requiem for a dream is a graphic and often unpleasant movie, but it's evident that was the intention. disney cartoons and comic-book blockbusters are all fine and good, but movies like this are the reason i'm a movie addict. movies about young, strung-out junkies are not new. movies like another day in paradise, rush, and kids all addressed similar issues, to varying degrees of success. the tough part is not showing the ugliness of heroin addiction. just watch someone shooting up and you're seeing a tragedy. what's difficult is presenting honest characters, and not apologizing for their actions. they're not heroes or villains in aronofsky's hands, and how you feel about these characters lies with you. the screenplay doesn't guide you, and any movie that forces you to decide things for yourself is always a welcome change.  everyone has their addictions, right? for some, it's crack cocaine. others can't function without their morning cup of coffee. love, contentment, approval, happiness; wish for any of them too hard, and you find yourself an addict. darren aronofsky's requiem for a dream displays how rampant addiction affects the lives of four interlocked characters, and it's not a pretty picture. but that's exactly why this is an excellent movie. while several scenes are of unnerving discomfort, the intention is never simply to shock. a filmmaker can ""stun"" an audience whenever he wants to; it's his party. the tough part is to tell a story and prove thematic points by using the shock value responsibly.  harry (jared leto) is a heroin addict. when we first meet him, he is appropriating his mother's television set to hock for his next ""fix"". long-suffering mother sarah (ellen burstyn) screams with her son, but never really gets angry with him. five minutes later, she's simply buying the tv back. harry's best friend tyrone (marlon wayans) and girlfriend marion (jennifer connelly) also participate in harry's hypodermic activities, and the three eventually hatch a plan: to become dealers on their own and make thousands of bucks! meanwhile, sarah has received a strange phone call, promising her a spot as a tv contestant. alone in her home, she quickly begins preparing for her night on tv by popping diet pills.  this is a movie of several excellent components, most notably a handful of excellent performances, a restrained yet visually stunning directorial style, and a hypnotic musical score. while a handful of scenes linger a bit too long, that's a nearly pointless complaint in a movie so strong on nearly every other level. requiem for a dream is not a ""fun"" movie, nor is it merely a drug-related melodrama. this is a smart movie about how addiction shackles people, for movie fans who can handle the heavy stuff.  ellen burstyn is remarkable in this movie. while she hasn't been seen in films too often lately, her performance simply should place her back in this should have placed her in the public eye. as a woman who becomes increasingly more unable to deal with reality, she is heart-breakingly believable, and the result is one of the best acting performances i have seen. also quite surprising is the work of jennifer connelly, in a nearly impossible role. her stunning beauty has somehow mislabeled her as a ""pin-up"" actress, as she's nearly always excellent, regardless of how small the role. she'll get a lot of attention for her courageous performance. jared leto is serviceable as the anti-hero harry. although it's easy to buy him as a junkie, he simply plays his role too clean-cut most of the time. leto is tough to buy him as a sleazy addict when he looks like the cover of a teen magazine. director aronofsky presents several unique sequences, and he offers several harsh and resonant montage sequences, some truly shocking visual sequences, and a wonderfully effective usage of sound effects. (each moment of addiction satisfaction is presented in a rapid-fire display of color, light and sound.) especially memorable is the use of the infectious score by clint mansell, which gives the movie a dark, desperate heartbeat.  much has currently been made of the mpaa's decision to threaten this movie an nc-17 rating, thanks to a sequence near the end, which depicts some particularly unsavory acts. apparently, the mpaa missed the point of this movie entirely. by deleting (or even editing) the scene in question would negate the entire point of the movie: that true addiction leads to true degradation. i was glad he didn't compromise.  i can't promise that you'll love this movie, but you'll be able to see how censoring a movie can sometimes disembowel it. requiem for a dream is a tough movie to watch, but the film offers a lot to enjoy. darren aronofsky deftly avoids many of the ""drug-movie"" cliches so evident in other films of this style, and his film is a sobering and fascinating piece of work. while this movie is not for all tastes, i can recommend it as one of the best and bravest drug-movies ever made . requiem for a dream is a film that will stay with you long after you leave the theater, and it's a rare film that can do that.",positive

No Name,4.0,"notable como pocas, réquiem for a dream tiene un gran problema. no es agradable de ver. 4 historias vinculadas a la droga y la soledad se mezclan, desencadenado cada una en especie de locura. la obra que consolidó a aronofsky como director de renombre, y en especial a clint mansell, por un soundtrack que quizás es el más conocido de la historia. recomendable, pero afirme el estómago.",positive

No Name,3.5,"7.5/10  requiem for a dream is a true visual marvel, and does a brilliant job of creating nail-biting tension and a nightmarish scenario - however, it's a bit too heavy handed in its anti-drug message to truly soar.",positive
No Name,5.0,5 stars come on people,neutral
No Name,5.0,darren aronofsky is a true cinematic artist. jennifer connelly and jared leto have palpitating chemistry.,positive
No Name,5.0,"a masterpiece. if you still want to do drugs after seeing it, then i have no words. love the pulse-pounding score and cinematography.",positive
No Name,2.5,"although there are some really creative shots and ways to covey the different addictions, this is an oppressively miserable film.",negative
No Name,3.0,"the message gets a bit muddled. heroin and diet pills can destroy lives, but the characters are also destroyed by neglectful doctors (sara's doctor not picking up on her hallucinations, harry's doctor ignoring the arm) and a justice system that fails to understand that many druggies are non-violent people that should face rehabilitation and not retribution (marlon's narrative). the message seems to be this: addiction is bad, drugs are bad, don't do them or they will destroy your lives, but too many extraneous variables are in the narrative. what is the film trying to say? i feel like it was just trying to be bleak and depressing for the sake of it. well-filmed though.",negative
No Name,4.5,"despite the obvious lack of subtlety, this rightfully depressing and memorable movie is expertly crafted and acted, resulting in a vivid and formidable picture of our darkest human qualities.",positive
No Name,5.0,"bleak, devastating and profoundly honest, this film manages to say more in under 2 hours than most can do in a lifetime.",negative
No Name,5.0,"powerful, scary and dramatic! i watched the movie about 10 years ago and just watched it again, it still has the same impact on me. definitely a masterpiece!",negative
No Name,1.5,"i got to say that ""requiem for a dream"" is one of the unusual movie i have ever seen. it's a movie that you will have no understanding the story line. the performances in this movie are kind of acceptable. darren aronofsky gives us some that is a different style in his directing. the screenplay by hubert selby, jr. is okay. the score is fine. ""i got to say that this is not my favorite.",positive
No Name,5.0,"so mad at myself for putting off seeing this film for so long. this film is mainly about the abuse of drugs and how they end up ruining your life one way or another if you have no self control. but then again, heroin is said to be quite addicting.  harry (jared leto), girlfriend marion (jennifer connolly) and friend and partner tyrone (marlon wayans) are good friends who like to do drugs. but they either do it to feel good in general or to stop themselves from feeling bad in a bad situation. this film gives a great look into how addicts do drugs and everything is all better to them. harry and tyrone get into a sticky situation when they are in need of more drugs so they take part in a drug lord's operation, making them eventually travel from their hometown of brooklyn to miami, where harry is forcibly taken to the hospital by tyrone so doctors can take a look at his dead arm. at the end of the film, the two of them end up going to prison and harry's arm is amputated.  marion on the other hand continues to support her addiction by taking part in prostitution and sex rings.  as for another important character, sara (ellen burstyn) is harry's mother who is widowed and stays home and watches her favorite infomercial/game show all day long. she gets a call one day saying that she has been chosen to appear on said show. to lose weight, she tries to go on a diet, failing, and then succumbing to horribly addicting diet pills.  it's a sad road sara travels on. she becomes addicted to these pills and becomes mentally unstable, waiting to hear from the producers of the show to tell her when she can be on the show.  in the end, all four characters curl up in a fettle position. i cried deeply.  this film is so sad but also, so incredible well directed and edited with great camera work and great fast paced scenes (hip hop cuts), especially cuts on drug related items during at which time the audience assumes the characters are getting high.  such a once in a lifetime film. every mature minded individual should see it.  requiem for a dream, i give you a 100%.",positive
No Name,5.0,the kind of movie one does never get to forget and changes the way you see everything.,positive
No Name,4.5,"two word review: slowly intense. the story starts out slow, but gradually crescendos into a chaotic, awesome climax, as the lives of all four main characters unravel around them, terrible but impossible to look away from. all the stories are amazing, making it impossible to not care about the characters. fantastic movie, but very intense. not for the faint of heart.",negative
No Name,4.5,"""oh my god harry.."" - the opening line to my absolute favorite bastille song (it's a cover song, but i don't give a shiz): requiem for blue jeans. the movie starts out on a frantic/sad/confusing/angry note, and spirals out of control so fast, you won't even know what hit you. from a non-drug addicts perspective, requiem has you trying to relate to what everyone is feeling or going through, it's a roller coaster of back catalog memories. requiem is a massive slap in the face to anyone that has a drug addiction, and if they continue to use after having seen this movie, well, may god have mercy on their soul. the editing and imagery was executed perfectly. at no point in the film did i feel lost (except the first 5 minutes, but then everything became very clear to me what was going on) or confused about the timeline of events taking place, it flowed exceedingly well. the amount of sorrow i felt for each character at certain points, summoned ol' kermit to the back of my throat. when kermit makes an appearance, i know the movie is a winner. requiem for a dream is extremely powerful and should not be taken with a grain of salt. thanks to this recommendation, i could finally put a face to yet another favorite bastille cover song of mine. the song: what would you do -- fades out with the following quote, ""it's a reason to get up in the morning. it's a reason to lose weight, to fit in the red dress. it's a reason to smile. it makes tomorrow all right."" i never searched the quote or let it bother me too much that i didn't have the slightest clue what movie it came from, because it was too beautiful to want to google it. there was a certain air of mystery behind the voice that i loved hearing so much. however, the pictures in my mind will be that much more meaningful to these songs after having seen this movie. and yes, i have a terrible addiction to bastille. let's just hope it doesn't spiral out of control..",positive
