No Name,4.0,one of the best action films ever created.,positive
No Name,5.0,one of the best action movies ever made. pack with action and you will be  sad watching it. i do not care who you are you need to see this.,negative
No Name,5.0,amazing in theatre's. underwhelming at home unless you've seen it on a big screen with surround sound first.,positive
No Name,5.0,lmkiytfgjgsxfhnjhddgf,negative
No Name,1.0,cowboys and indians in the great australian outback.. there is no plot.. just one l-o-n-g chase with lots of dead and dying  that ultimately circled 'round itself...,negative
No Name,5.0,you must take this ride!,positive
No Name,5.0,"great movie, but should've been a different supporting character - not mad max..",negative
No Name,0.5,"utter garbage. terrible story, terrible acting, ridiculous special effects.",negative
No Name,5.0,simply incredible. two hours of suspension of disbelief and immersive dystopian entertainment. what more can you say: mad max to the max.,positive
No Name,5.0,this movie literally made me tired sitting through it. in the best sort of way. i felt exhausted like i was along for the ride. it’s a great action movie and is pretty much go-go-go from the beginning with little time wasted on exhibition.,positive
No Name,4.0,"crazy, entertaining and fun, but overly voilent. provided you don't take this movie too seriously - it's thoroughly enjoyable. tip: if you haven't seen this - watch furiosa first (even though it's a more recent release) - as this movie seamlessly flows on after furiosa and it's well worth watching them back to back.",negative
No Name,5.0,esse é o melhor filme de ação de todos os tempos,positive
No Name,3.5,"with astonishing moments and great, yet sometimes awkward visuals, it’s hard to decide what i thought of this movie and really, the entire franchise as a whole. the action was more than serviceable and lived up to its reputation, and the story was a step above the likes of thunderdome for sure. as for the actors, they were all tremendous in their roles and the acting was far beyond the first three movies with tom hardy taking control of the lead role and charlize theron joining the fray. as a new addition to the franchise that is mad max, it is refreshing and nice to see, but as for the franchise itself, i don’t believe i am too fond of its style.",positive
B,5.0,a perfect action film. no notes.,positive
No Name,5.0,this movie was pure adrenaline from start to finish.. loved it!,positive
No Name,4.0,"probably one of the best action movies ever. i'd recommend it, especially if you're really into this kind of genre.",positive
No Name,5.0,excellent and captivating cinematography. top tier action and story accompanied with excellent pacing. an immersive adventure off originality. exceeds the original films in everyway.,positive
No Name,4.0,this movie is so good. highly entertaining and the performances are awesome. my guy tom hardy kills it!,positive
No Name,5.0,it couldn't be more peak than this.absolute cinema!,positive
No Name,1.0,just saw the space ice version and you gotta be forkin' kiddin' me.,negative
No Name,5.0,"absolutely exhilarating, and endlessly entertaining. george miller's masterpiece of death and destruction will stand strong for years to come thanks to awesome characters and amazing practical effects that most of hollywood has forgotten about by now.",positive
No Name,4.0,"filme foda, o roteiro é legal, o vilão é bacana, mas o que torna o filme melhor são as cenas de ação que são muito excelentes, que passam em um deserto de areia gostei do tom hardy como mad max, gostei da participação da cherlize theron como furiosa, gostei de uma cena em que o maluco estava segurandobuma guitarra enquanto saia fogo pelos canos pelo caminhão, as cenas de dialogo algumas foram boas e outras não, mas com tudo isso, eu recomendo muito esse filme, esse foi o melhor da franquia mad max.",positive
No Name,4.5,direção: bom atuação: bom roteiro: ok caracterização: bom soundtrack: bom,positive
No Name,5.0,"as good as any movie i have ever seen, amazing.",positive
No Name,3.0,"not special story in whole, similar endings have been seen many (in different locations depending the script). beginning is interesting and endures as such quite well but not till end. on my opinion.",negative
No Name,5.0,"i loved it. george miller turned the desert into an absolute battleground with high-stakes action sequences and some genuinely likable characters: furiosa is a powerful warrior who wants to redeem herself for serving immortan joe, the movie's amazing villain; nux is insecure about his impending death and wants to go out in a literal blaze of glory; and the titular max is as cool as ever, learns to open up to others, and the speech he gives when all seems lost was just perfect.  it hurts to know this masterpiece was a nightmare to make and how badly it financially underperformed. i honestly think the movie warranted a pg-13 rating; the goriest part was probably the villain's death, it was totally bearable for a modern teenage audience. but hey, the fact that a sequel was even greenlit sparks a little hope. mad max lived, it died, and lived again. fury road will ride eternal, shiny and chrome.",positive
No Name,5.0,my favourite movie of the past decade.  larger than life and twice as fun.,positive
No Name,5.0,la mejor película de la década.,positive
No Name,5.0,the post apocalyptic film of our age. nuf zed.,negative
No Name,4.5,"the perfect adventure film.  thrilling and original - that's how you can describe this film in two words. george miller's style may not be everyone's cup of tea,and some may not understand it, but this is true cinema. with minimal dialogue and a huge amount of action, the film still manages to remain genuinely deep.",positive
No Name,4.0,this is a great film that i had to rewatch after seeing furiosa because the first time i watch it i was lost about what this was about; furiosa was such a great introduction of the franchise to new viewers that this is perfect sequel to it. i loved it more and appreciated after furiosa so stellar job perfect action film to enjoy; hopefully they make a third one to end this saga of soft reboot.,positive
No Name,5.0,"i don’t think i’ve ever seen this much intense action in one movie. just wow. i wish gibson could have played the title guy, but hardy does it great. and miller somehow creates this insane future world that is believable, scary, and fascinating. sci-fi does not get any better.",positive
No Name,0.5,i really don't understand how this movie is rated so high. i was hoping that it wouldn't be any worse than thunderdome. it's like mad max meets the rocky horror pic show. i've never not finished watching a movie and am highly disappointed that i sat thru the entirety of fury road. never will watch it a second time.,negative
No Name,4.0,"did not expect to love it, got persuaded by a friend to see it.   some of it i found kinda gruesome and hard to watch but overall i really enjoyed it and i love furiosa.",positive
No Name,5.0,"arguably, the greatest action movie ever made. the movie is full throttle from start to finish. it never gets boring and leaves you wanting even more. a must see.",positive
No Name,5.0,"a perfect action film. great cast, practical effects, not too long, intense and memorable scenes, and just enough story to glue it together. don't bother with furiosa, it's a cheap imitation of this film.",positive
No Name,4.5,fury road perfectly captures the harsh and epic nature of the franchise while also introducing the most gorgeous portrayal of australia to date.,positive
No Name,5.0,"an action masterpiece. easy must watch if you enjoy the mad max universe/saga and some good ol' action. sure, not having mel gibson as max is sad, but tom hardy really delivers. talking about delivering, charlize as furiosa is *chef's kiss*. solid story, great acting and awesome action scenes!  10/10 action movie. watched many times.",positive
No Name,4.5,"great movie! i have no clue how they tie into the original three with mel gibson, but great action and story. i could do without the guitar guy though lol",positive
No Name,5.0,"not perfect but what would perfection be in an apocalyptic setting?  as far as action movies go, nothing remotely compares to this. a remarkable piece of art depicting the best and worst of the animal human.",negative
No Name,5.0,a mondern classic.,positive
No Name,5.0,"if you’re a fan of the franchise or new to the series, this film is a great experience that stands out as one of the best action films i’ve seen in a long time.",positive
No Name,2.0,"i dont really know why people likes mad max that much. actors and animators did really great job, but um, the director should have contributed a little more to the film's script, because its a : escape-fight-drive-escape-fight-drive pattern, nothing more. i got bored halfway through the movie. bored in the action movie...",negative
No Name,5.0,"wow. great dip into mad max present day, fleshed out. did such a great job with all of the elements. edge of your seat action the entire film. sometimes there is so much going on you feel like at a grand finale of fireworks.",positive
No Name,5.0,mad max en su más pura escencia!!!,positive
No Name,5.0,"this movie really is perfect. the pacing is amazing, the action is perfect, costumes, cinematography, literally everything. it’s very gory & gross but amazing nonetheless. both tom and charlize couldn’t be any sexier in this, and they both give a perfect performance. i don’t particularly love action movies but this is one of my favorite movies of any genre. i just can’t recommend this enough.",positive
No Name,4.0,"good, but only a spinoff.",positive
No Name,5.0,"wow. this movie is amazing. its very different to what you expect from the mad max franchise. but then compare mad max 1 with 2. tom hardy does a great job, even with very little to say. charlize theron really does lead this movie. this movie does a great job at setting up a new universe. fast paced non stop entertainment. love it",positive
No Name,5.0,"the finest movie you ever made, one that i’ve been waiting for for three decades or more.  the grand master didn’t let us down with this forever creation.  tom hardy was divine, one couldn’t ask for more from him.",positive
No Name,5.0,the order of the novel is surprising,negative
No Name,5.0,"one of the hardests things to do in cinema is tell a story without using words... and gosh, this one knows how to tell a tale. two action scenes of 1 hour glued together with a 10 min break. cannot recommend enough",positive
No Name,4.0,"eventhough it sometimes felt it kind of dragged, i was pleasently surprised. i thought it was gonna be another marvel type movies with the same type jokes and dialogue, but it was quite good!",positive
No Name,4.5,intence action you really can feel thespeed o the cars,neutral
No Name,1.5,"while i have a lot of admiration for tom hardy, even his talent can't save this one for me.  the movie feels like a relentless series of glorified action scenes that fail to establish any emotional connection.  the plot is almost non-existent, essentially boiling down to a prolonged chase for two-thirds of the film, only to reverse course and head back for the final act.  despite the visually stunning spectacle and high-octane energy, the lack of a deeper narrative or character development leaves the experience feeling hollow and unsatisfying. the film's emphasis on action over substance ultimately detracts from its potential to be a truly memorable entry in the franchise.",negative
No Name,5.0,this is still one of the best action movies i've ever seen! 2 hours of exhilarating action and practical stunts with phenomenal performances from everyone.   you must witness it!,positive
No Name,5.0,hands down the very best action movie ever made in the entire history of cinema.,positive
No Name,0.5,it's just action. no scenario. nothing to think about. it's not worth its rating.,negative
No Name,5.0,"an action movie opus. ""witness!""",positive
No Name,5.0,amazing! brazil loved it!,positive
No Name,1.0,"i saw it at the theater and walked out, i don’t walk out of many movies but it is simply terrible, not entertaining and i was bored.  i like charlize theron but it sucked.  by the way, i sat through the ending later because i had to see if it had a happy ending and it did, but it didn’t help, still was terrible!",negative
No Name,5.0,melhor filme de ação dos últimos anos. ele e john wicky mas em termos de dimensão mad max é sem dúvida o melhor 🤩,positive
No Name,3.5,"it was a novelty, now a classic",positive
No Name,5.0,"honestly one of the only movies i think that completely outshines the originals. as awesome as they were at the time, they missed the absolute mayhem and carnage we are shown in the masterclass of effects. obviously the time they were made plays a huge part, but this movie i believe just has better overall writing and characters. it is a must watch and each time i watch it i’m thoroughly in awe in what the team was able to accomplish in making this masterpiece",positive
No Name,5.0,absolutely unbelievable! complete insanity from start to finish. maybe the greatest action scenes ever made with indescribable set design & cinematography. the world building is captivating. themes of oppression impact emotionally.,positive
No Name,5.0,they should make a mad max movie without mad max.  i would totally pretend to care about it.,negative
No Name,4.5,"really enjoyed this movie! one of the best action movies for sure. i understand that some may find this weird, but if you really look at it then you'll also find its brilliance in the world building and plot. it's pretty incredible that this movie actually has a well formed plot considering it's pure non-stop action throughout the entirety of the movie. acting: 10/10. story: 10/10. character development: 8.5/10. action: 10/10. in my opinion this is a solid 9/10.",positive
No Name,3.5,"recently watched this again. great story-telling, character development is pretty great.   however, this harkened the departure from the character of max. until the second act he is really just a footnote, literally called ""blood bag"". his entrance as a main character is impressive, which to the quality writing and editing.",positive
No Name,5.0,new classic. best action movie ever.,positive
No Name,5.0,the greatest car/action film ever made.,positive
No Name,5.0,"no other movie like it, except the old ones. the only problem i had after watching was that i wanted more tom hardy. the themes are risks that pay off. camera angles always being in the center, to the music being played by the villains. stupendous! 5/5",positive
No Name,3.0,not bad it was okay..,neutral
No Name,4.0,8.5/10  that's it. that's my review.,positive
No Name,5.0,"wow. just wow. a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end. well produced, acted and directed. my favourite film.",positive
No Name,1.0,"the film can be summarized as follows: a group rebels at point a and tries to find refuge at point b. pursued by angry individuals from point a, they encounter hostility along the way. reaching point b, they are disappointed and decide to return to point a, facing the same adversaries again. the film is filled with excessive action and meaningless stunts, making it monotonous and repetitive. save your time.",negative
No Name,5.0,"can't get tired of this movie! i have watched more than a dozen times and will watch many more. don't get fooled by the length of it, the action and characters will keep you entertained for the whole 3 hours. so good!",positive
No Name,5.0,perfect action film. very exciting.,positive
No Name,3.0,"madness, redemption and octane. commendable drive for what would be something that isnt. lots of practical effects and action to distract you of the lack of character buildup",positive
No Name,5.0,more films like this please!,positive
No Name,4.5,"action packed and beautiful piece of art. you can tell a story not only with words , and thats what this movie does , similar to max who doesn't speak much and yet says a lot, so does the movie with the stunning visuals and hidden meanings.",positive
No Name,5.0,utter. master. piece.,negative
No Name,5.0,absolutely great rollercoaster ride from start to finish.,positive
No Name,5.0,one of my all time favorites right here!,positive
No Name,5.0,"surprisingly, this turned out to be  the best mad max movie of them all.",positive
No Name,5.0,so good i saw it twice.,positive
No Name,5.0,super cinematic. the whole movie is a chase but it's done very well even when the pacing slows down a lil bit. great storytelling. you could mute the whole movie and still visually follow the story,positive
No Name,5.0,i have matched this movie dozens of times. i was hooked by the first three movies and awaited this movie with baited breath. i was not disappointed.,positive
No Name,5.0,visually stunning and unique.  great choice of actors. great soundtrack. will watch again and again.  if there is a definition of what apocalyptic movie should be.,positive
No Name,2.0,if santa claus brother had a harem? this movie just sucks it's like someone said tell me the last 15 minutes of road warrior and made this movie out of that description but instead of a gas shortage it's a water shortage.,negative
No Name,5.0,"the greatest film of the century hands-down,what else is there to say?",positive
No Name,5.0,"this is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. it wastes no time getting to what makes movies great. epic action,unique and creative world building, and it does a great job reflecting mankind in its most basic nature of savagery and survival. this film makes a mythology of characters who are all doomed regardless of their efforts, yet gives the audience a sense of hope against all odds through the most impossible of circumstances. this movie has a great music score and memorable imagery including the wonderful use of practical effects and the ingenuity of the iconic custom vehicles made for it. truly one of a kind.",positive
No Name,5.0,masterpiece!!! best action film,positive
No Name,0.5,i hated this film so much that i went back and watched all the previous max mad films and then returned. it's still unwatchable. utter rubbish.,negative
No Name,1.0,"don’t understand why this movie was rated so highly. yes, the visuals are amazing but that’s as far as it goes. the infantile script and low grade acting are set against mismatched, grandiose music.",negative
No Name,5.0,one of the greatest movies of all time.,positive
No Name,3.5,enjoyable.. not as good as previous mad max entries but still enjoyable enough for hard core fans. if you're going to go i think it is better to spend the extra money for imax.,positive
No Name,5.0,"a modern action masterpiece that strikes all the right chords and rocks all the right riffs. a few unnecessary gross-out moments aside, this is arguably as good as any 2000’s action movie has been, holding the title without a challenger in sight. witness it!",positive
No Name,5.0,everything about this movie is amazing,positive
No Name,4.5,fantastic action and cinematography. my only criticism is that mel gibson wasn't max.,negative
No Name,0.5,"what the hell was everyone else watching that this movie was so popular? the visuals and audio were great, but the characters and plot were unbelievably bad. no, i really mean that. watch the movie again and try to imagine any actual human being being so unbelievably idiotic as the characters in this movie. ""hey, we just escaped the bad guys by the narrowest of narrow margins. what should we do with our newfound freedom? i know, let's go back so we can do another 20 minute action montage!""  for the love of all that is holy, this was a massive insult to the first two actual mad max films. it firmly belongs in a category with thunderdome.",negative
No Name,5.0,pure octane high adrenaline spectacle. it's like doing drugs without the withdrawal but all of the addiction! witness meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!,positive
No Name,5.0,one of the greatest action films ever made.,positive
No Name,5.0,simply one of the best action movies (or any kind of movie) ever made.,positive
No Name,5.0,best action movie ever made. i’ve seen this movie 10+ times and it never gets old. there is not even a dull millisecond in this film. it is exhilarating and action packed from beginning to end. there is nothing else like it.,positive
No Name,5.0,love this word and miller is amazing as making it feel so real,positive
No Name,5.0,this film is nothing short of brilliant. a top 10 of all time (i will die on that hill)!,positive
No Name,3.0,i'm just not getting it (unfortunately). everyone's raving about this. over the years i've watched it twice. and came away disappointed twice.,negative
No Name,5.0,great move was blast! will watch again,positive
No Name,5.0,loved the commentary and the world that was imagined what astonishing,positive
No Name,4.5,i have to say i was pleasantly surprised well done prequel i enjoyed the acting good storyline nothing negative to say,positive
No Name,5.0,amazing action film. definitely an improvement for the franchise. wanted to purchase it right after watching at the theater.,positive
No Name,4.0,"an amazing action film, some of the best looking action scenes i’ve ever witnessed.",positive
No Name,3.0,"great cast, great action. ct is too pretty and soft to be the menace that i believe she is supposed to be. th has no connection to the mg character except his name. in many ways, this movie barrows the mm-tm just for marketing. an enjoyable 2-hour car chase, but definitely an oddity.",positive
No Name,5.0,this is what i call an epic in action cinema.,positive
No Name,1.0,i must have watched a different movie than everyone else. i can’t even express how stupid this movie is from start to finish,negative
No Name,5.0,the greatest action movie ever made not only does it have some of the best action ever but it also has deep and emotional moments this movie is just plain sick it makes me wanna go past the speed limit while playing eminem or heavy metal also my favorite part was the scene where mad max battles the guitar guy,positive
No Name,5.0,one of the best action movies i’ve ever seen,positive
No Name,5.0,one of the best action movies ever!!,positive
No Name,5.0,"the tippy top of all action flicks.the visuals,sound,editing,acting are all perfect.this movie delivers in every way and taunts you with more.10/10 movie.",positive
No Name,5.0,this is all you want from a movie call mad max,negative
No Name,4.5,"this movie is one of the best i've seen in years, loved every piece of it! not to mention the chasing scene with the brother in arms playing, that sequence was epic",positive
No Name,5.0,"i have never seen a film light my innocent eyes up with flames like this before. it changed my whole world. there is a distinctly animal instinct we all share, and this film lets this beast free. i can't believe how intricately destructive this film is to a sense of modern civility. perhaps that is what it truly is to be mad, to live the way we do. for, we are all in this world just as mad as max, and thank goodness for that. for now, i'm increadibly grateful we've got our regular old joe leading our insane country in 2024, and not immortan joe. beholding this film makes me incredibly grateful for a lot of things, and scares my darkest and far-reaching fears and nightmares away. for that, i can't thank george miller and his entire crew enough.",positive
No Name,5.0,"it gets better every time i watch it. awesome action scenes and perfect direction, music and cinematography",positive
No Name,3.0,"can we admit how vastly overrated this film is? its fine but no more than that. yes it looks very pretty and yes theres good action and designwork going on, but that all there is. the cast are chewing the scenery more than in a hammer horror and the characters and stpry are as deep and nuanced as a small puddle.",negative
No Name,5.0,"i love this movie, production, set and acting is amazing",positive
No Name,5.0,"pedal to the metal. fantastic. when i first saw this in a cinema, the audience applauded at the end of the first 20 minutes which was kind of rare and astonishing",positive
No Name,5.0,absolutely incredible of a film. definitely in my top 20 movies of all time,positive
No Name,5.0,one of my top 5 movies of all time!!! -211s,positive
No Name,4.5,an absolutely thrill ride and a definite must watch!,positive
No Name,5.0,"a superb continuation/semi-reboot of the post-apocalyptic mad max saga...and this one is truly masterful. incredible acting, a gritty storyline and the most colorful characters we've yet seen in the series. this story sees familiar tropes from the previous movies, but builds world that has moved on far beyond the blasted landscape of the original trilogy. this movie cannot be missed.",positive
No Name,5.0,best looking 4k uhd blu ray i have. action sequences are greatest of all time.,positive
No Name,5.0,don't mind me just excitedly witnessing in preparation for next week.,positive
No Name,5.0,"the unrivaled stunts, cinematography and still holds up on the rewatch before getting tickets for the latest installment. brilliant movie and performances!",positive
No Name,3.5,"it was shot beautifully, tom hardy's acting wasn't the best.",positive
No Name,5.0,yeeeeeeeesssssss!!!!!!!!!!!! banger ass movie filled with non stop action!!!!! love it!!!!!!,positive
No Name,2.0,"there's like no dialogue, it's like watching an mtv music video, just one huge chase through the wasteland with music and little character development. contrast this mess to the older mel gibson mad max movies that actually had a story and deeper characters!  the cinematography is beautiful, eye catching, the action is on point too, but it's a huge disappointment if you want anything of substance. this is more like an eye candy type of movie, something just to show off a new tv's capabilities.",negative
No Name,1.0,"what a wild movie that is absolutely amazi....dumb. haha, i just did not get this movie at all. it feels like the director was high when he filmed this. felt incoherent and pointless.",negative
No Name,5.0,'we're going to the green place!',positive
No Name,1.0,"terrible cgi, was theron actually in the desert at all? looks like bad studio lighting all the way through and the  cheapest cgi effects ever made. why is no one mentioning this?",negative
No Name,5.0,"one love, one shot... give it all you've got. the perfect action movie. for a 2hr car chase, i'm not sure anything comes close. watch at half speed to lengthen/double your enjoyment. if you think my rating is wrong, you're right,... and by right, i meant wrong.",negative
No Name,5.0,tom hardy te hace recordar a medgizon la actuación del actor como max es increíble la historia es muy buena tiene mucha acción,positive
No Name,5.0,"pulse-pounding and viscerally unforgiving, george miller's undeniable masterpiece is as rich narratively as it is visually. truly a modern classic in every sense of the word.",positive
No Name,5.0,"absolute gleeful fun in the most unhinged way, ""mad max: fury road"" stands as one of, if not the absolute best, action movie made to date.",positive
No Name,5.0,"must watch!!  this is a strong female lead of the year. too bad it was over shadowed by ww.  fun, intense, edge of your seat action movie furiosa is truly a warrior!!",positive
No Name,4.5,"""mad max: fury road"" é possivelmente o melhor filme da franquia até então, conseguindo trazer de volta a ação frenética do segundo filme e possuindo uma história cativante (como o terceiro). é também bastante interessante ver como o tom hardy consegue manter a essência de uma personagem tão icónica ao mesmo tempo que a torna uma personagem sua. belos visuais, cenas de ação e um elenco invejável fazem deste filme um dos melhores do género.",positive
No Name,5.0,the film with the most beautiful photography i have ever seen. the film doesn't give many explanations about the characters but you still manage to identify with that character. the film has some crazy settings. the villain manages to steal the show when he appears,positive
No Name,5.0,"witness this intense and action packed battle on the road for home! as the imperator furiosa defies the oppressive immortan joe by stealing his wives and his war rig, she joins forces with the drifter max rockatansky to fight off joe's war-boys in order to return to the green place. an epic in so many ways, we are thrown into a brutal, desert wasteland of violence and war, with a memorable cast of characters making it epic!",positive
No Name,5.0,"future belongs to the mad but not sure if the prequel furiosa: a mad max saga will belong anywhere, a sequel surely could be.",positive
No Name,4.5,"this movie deserves everything that's been said. it has good characters but the action is more important. 2 hours of amazing action and car design, a nonstop car chase sound bad but man is it fun.",positive
No Name,5.0,absolutely stunning work of filmmaking. and even better in 3d!,positive
No Name,5.0,"a modern classic, and a milestone in cinema history.",positive
No Name,4.0,"incredible in every way. the setting, the practical effects and almost no use of cgi, except for furiosa's arm, the violence, the costumes and the design of the vehicles are amazing. highly recommended",positive
No Name,5.0,"damn, you're the most perfect action for them you can make for its purpose very entertaining and amazing action sequences, it left me wanting more, which means it did its job",positive
No Name,5.0,"yep this lived up to the hype, seriously one of the best action movies i have ever seen",positive

No Name,4.5,stunning visuals and costume design.,positive
No Name,5.0,my favorite action film,positive
No Name,5.0,"mad max fury road is a spectacle in many aspects,despite not having a wonderful story, its chase scenes and its frenetic pace give the film a special touch, technically speaking the film is spectacular,beautiful in every way, in my opinion a truly splendid film.",positive
No Name,5.0,it's brilliant! not stop action!,positive
No Name,0.5,"utter cringe inducing garbage. saw it with 4 friends, and we all thought the same. these reviews are mind boggling",negative
No Name,2.0,only thing that makes the film respectable to this rating is due to the stunts all being done by the actors. apart from that i can name at least 10 action films to better spend 1.5 hours of your time.,negative
No Name,4.5,really awesome movie. usually i am not too much in action-centric movies but this one really nailed it.,positive
No Name,5.0,one of my favorite films. this movie was great from start to finish. worth watching over and over.,positive
No Name,4.5,very good movie full of chaos and acton. recommended watch,positive
No Name,5.0,unreal movie. amazing cinematography and action the entire movie. needs to be watched with a loud sound system and big tv. 10/10,positive
No Name,5.0,"the film had to be watched full volume on a bose sound system. the story, acting, music and because it was filmed mostly by stunts it was spectacular",positive
No Name,5.0,"the absolute peak of the action genre, up there in the 1st place alongside rambo first blood and die hard. a modern masterpiece in all senses.",positive
No Name,4.5,"""welcome to the apocalypse. i hope u like leather.""",negative
No Name,5.0,"a perfect movie and far-and-away the best action of the decade. so many original characters with underrated arcs, all the more impressive with lack of dialogue and short runtime. the awards speak for themselves when it comes to the editing and visual effects. well worth the 37 year wait!",positive
No Name,1.0,worse then thunderdome.  i watched when it came out and didn't like it.  all this time later i keep seeing reviews on how great it is. so i watched it again over the weekend.  still don't see to merit the strong reviews.  they should have ended with road warrior.,negative
No Name,4.5,the type of film you can just unplug your brain and enjoy the ride.,positive
No Name,0.5,"in the words of anakin skywalker, i don't like sand.",negative

No Name,4.5,"this is a great story in the mad max universe. charleze theron shows she's willing to push her acting skills to the max, and portrays the heroine in a superb fashion. hardy is equally as fantastic. respecting the rather dull scenery while applauding the cinematography, it is what it is ... post-apocalypse world with everything going to hell.",positive
No Name,5.0,i enjoyed the original mad max trilogy and it was very entertaining but nothing compared to this one. it was wall to wall action with no break. i've always liked tom hardy and he's equally compelling in this as mel gibson  it's definitely worth the watch.,positive

No Name,5.0,"mad max fury road is one hell of a ride. from beginning to end this film is heart pounding. the action/choreography is fantastic and leaves you with one very big adrenaline rush all due to its fast pace. the pacing was very fast which worked well for this kind of story. then there are the performances which are great. charlize theron, tom hardy, and nicholas hoult where all great in this film with each one of seemingly becoming their characters rather than acting as them. in terms of direction george miller shows off his abilities. miller is amazing at making this steam punk dystopian world come to life. the fact that most of the visuals are made via practical effects is crazy. to add onto this, the cinematography and colors are great as well. mad max fury road is very fine filmmaking.  with all that being said i do find flaws in this film. the characters are pretty bland. the film is mostly fast paced however it does slow down at certain points to focus on it's characters. characters like furiosa, max, and nux were explored but, they weren't explored enough to make them particularly strong characters. they had the potential and when they were being explored it was great; however, they weren't fully explored/developed which is definitely the film's biggest flaw. the visual effects also looked a bit wacky and poor at times but that is more of a nitpick than an actual flaw.   mad max fury road is from a visual and practical sense phenomenal with great themes and performances; however, it's characters aren't particularly it's strong point. regardless, this is a fantastic film that i'll highly recommend.",positive

No Name,4.5,"i was indifferent to the original mad max movie, and i remember being disappointed by it on several attempts to watch it, so i wasn't expecting much from this sequel. was i wrong though! this movie is almost non stop action, and the story is both exciting and easy to follow. the special effects are first rate, and i soon became absorbed into the film's world. to be honest, the character's don't have a lot to say, and you mostly pick up the plot from riding with them on their journey. that's not a bad thing in this case, because the film's pace is such that there is no time for the verbose narrative often found in other movies. i highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes action movies because it is one of the best i have seen.",positive
No Name,3.0,this is a test review,negative
No Name,5.0,"all time classic. pretty much everything about this is flawless. the only minor complaints is there isn't much character development with max and dare i say it feels like he's not even the main character at certain points. furiosa is incredible and the best thing in this. she outshines max. also, the fact they go back the way they came makes it feel a little bit like the escape of the first half was pointless to an extent but who cares. this is 2 hours of a straight adrenline rush and the most action packed of the franchise. i will say this is a hair beneath mad max 2 for me because while hardy is really good as max, gibson is better. also, max had more development and focus and while the chases in this are amazing and incredible, the end of the second still i feel is slightly better. however, where the second can be a bit slow in the first half this floors it and never lets up the entire way. it's really just personal taste at that point comparing this and 2. watch it and decide for yourself!",positive

No Name,5.0,"spoilers this apocalyptic fiction follows max, a man coping with the death of his wife and child, who is captured by a group of survivors (more like lunatics), loyal to the tyrannical immortan joe. when furiosa takes joe's five wives in the war rig to bring them east to their liberty, max is dragged along in an insane adventure full of monster trucks, explosions, fire, death, bullets, gas, gas and more gas.   this is peak fiction. the apocalyptic desert that is depicted, the design of the war machines and costumes, the character arcs, fire, explosions, scale... its an action-fuelled masterpiece. the world miller has crafted is so erratic, chaotic and octane filled - its insane and beautiful. a wasteland where humans treat gas like a god, completely obsessed with badass-looking vehicles and meeting their death on the road. i wanted more when the credits rolled, more time to explore this eccentric world and its characters. for lack of a better term the shit in this movie is strait up cool. like look at the concept art for vehicles, the costumes and the landscape - and tell me its not fucking cool! the production design reminds me of blade runner, not because it is at all similar, but because it is visually striking, unique, imaginative and captivating. they have created a world here which is not ours, a fictional world with nuances and touches that make it wonderful to get lost in.   it was essentially non-stop action for two hours, and it never got old or boring, just high stakes over and over and over. the war rig was practically a character in itself and the battles moving at high speed will be forever etched in my mind. two hours of strait action and i could have done with two more. there was some very credible and satisfying character arcs here as well amidst the explosions. nux is absolutely the most notable. at the start of the film i hated this man and his people for their octane filled delusions of valhalla and blatant insanity, but by the end i saw nux as a man who put his life on the line for who he now considers friends. he escaped from the lies and oppression joe was feeding his people. it was a powerful character transition and death. max's relationship with furiosa and the wives is a pleasure to see unravel and become somewhat friendly at the end too.   one thing i really like about this film too is how it doesn't give you any exposition or explanation for the wasteland, factions, people, and how they came to be. at first i was confused (i haven't seen the originals), but i came to realize that them not opening the film up with some expedited narration, or exposition from the characters - makes it so much more intriguing and enthralling. the creators don't owe first time watchers an explanation as there's tons of previous movies and lore, and i like how we are not ‘babied' into this world, but simply taken along for the ride.   overall, mad max combines masterfully imaginative production design, world building, characters and gas to create one of the best action films i've ever seen.",positive

No Name,3.5,"i didn't what to make of this movie after knowing this was made by the same director as the previous films. this movie was strongly hyped and regarded highly but i wanted to see the original films first. within ten minutes i realized something, this isn't a sequel, but a reboot, with a new mad max, like the daniel craig bond movies replaced the previous bond movies.  a dystopian world that ran low on resources had led max rockatansky to become a once respectable lawman into a road warrior in a post-apocalyptic world who gets caught up in a fight for his life. captured and used for resources gets involved in a violent warlord's attempt to reclaim his offspring in five innocent expecting women taken from his care by a vicious but courageous female general known as furiosa. max escapes from the warlord only to run afoul of furiosa's mission but slowly but steadily gain each other's trust. but the warlord will not give up until he obtains his offspring as furiosa and mad max take the fight to the warlord.  i got to say i loved the previous mad max movies with all my heart, and just as sean connery will always be james bond to me, mel gibson will always be mad max. tom hardy is fine but he doesn't have mel's intensity and charisma. the real star of this movie is charlize theron who is amazing as an amazonian-type character furiosa. not as feral as i heard described, but smart and brave as well as strong. george miller should make more movies with her. all things considered a good movie, but not as great as the previous movies.",positive

No Name,3.5,"'max max: fury road' was a thunderously engaging film, including non-stop action and stunning aesthetics. but, although the film had so much potential, it ultimately fell short. i wanted the movie to work so much, but it couldn't deliver a proper story in the end. this picture could be seen as what happens in a child's imagination after watching 'the book of eli.' the characters lack adequate motivations and are somewhat restricted by the script. we know very little of their stories or how things came to be, but if you care little for understanding a film and would rather watch skull-crushing non-stop action, with stunning editing, and 'lord of the rings' level costume and set design, this is the picture for you.",positive
No Name,1.0,worst of the franchise was mad max even in it,negative
No Name,4.5,"great reboot of mad max. it worked because of the george miller's top notch cinematography and the stellar all star cast: tom hardy, charlize theron, zoe kravitz, riley keough... if you didn't get to see this movie in the theaters, you definitely missed out on a masterpiece because miller created special visual/audio effects that only works in theater.",positive

No Name,2.0,"big on stunts and effects weak on acting, dialogue, world or character building. simply watch for the stunts but if you are looking for something interesting, seek life elsewhere",negative
No Name,2.5,"i truly don’t understand the acclaim for this one. there is little to no exploration of the struggle the world is going through at this time. not does it even hesitate to explore into any of the character’s backstories. we’re just thrown into the plot very quickly with balls to the walls action from start to finish. the action was top notch and the scenery of the desolate world was cool. i just didn’t connect to the characters or any aspect of the plot, leaving this one ringing hollow for me",negative
No Name,5.0,possibly my favorite movie of all time. could not recommend more highly.,positive
No Name,5.0,a masterpiece from start to finish. a simple plot that tells a thousand stories. stuntwork unparalleled. if you like action even a little bit you have to see this movie. this movie has zero flaws.,positive
No Name,4.0,"how the original mad max might have looked with a big budget and modern technology. action scenes are great, sound design and visuals are a+. however, the soundtrack is very unmemorable, and i don't know if hardy works as max, at least if you prefer the original version of the character.",negative
No Name,5.0,"honestly, when i saw the movie's cover i was skeptical and when i fired it up on hbo, it grabbed me from the very beginning.   there was not a single moment of the movie where i was bored. i would totally recommend it.",positive

No Name,4.0,entertaining movie. plot was mediocre but the action and characters got us through to the end. the cast did a great job in their roles and delivered some good characters,positive
No Name,3.5,"tom hardy, no doubt, has a powerful presence, but it seems that cherlize theron dominated the movie, which puzzles me as to why the title ""mad max: fury road."" it should have been called ""mad furiosa: fury road."" hopefully, tom hardy will do another sequel and it will be more about his character! otherwise, don't entitle the movie mad max! he's amazing to watch and very entertaining but it seems to me he took a backseat in this one. nothing against theron but now i can understand why there may have been some conflict between the two of them. theron is an amazing performer but i was hoping to see more of hardy. just my opinion! kudos should go out to the rest of the cast, though. they were all wonderful and i can understand theron being frustrated making this movie because all i saw was desert and more desert. i would have gone berserk! however, i would hope that mel gibson would be proud of hardy for what he was able to contribute to this movie!",negative
No Name,0.5,"this movie was not as advertised!  no real character development, bad special effects, and a huge bait and switch.  people wanted a mad max movie not a charlie theron action movie!  i can't believe this shit has such a high score on this site!!!",negative
No Name,3.5,"premise and execution more ridiculous than waterworld, but a very entertaining action movie if you don't think too hard about the australian coast being only max 66.7 hours away at 30 kmph. 6.8/10 - not quite good but more than adequate.",positive

No Name,3.0,"the acting was solid. strong performances from everyone. however, it was sad to see the title character take a backseat in his own movie. the movie should have been called furiosa.",negative
No Name,3.5,"gorgeous visuals paired with non-stop action that was well choreographed, it's guaranteed to be a good time but nothing past that. the acting is very mid, as whilst it's not bad there's nothing specially unique or memorable about it, with even tom hardy admitting to not trying very hard during press conferences. the action is of course the highlight, and it's full of unique and memorable moments, just nothing that can redeem the pretty basic story of a point to point end goal, as everything that aren't fights or battles feel like exposition for the fights, leading to the ending and any attempt at emotion feeling lost as it comes off as too forced and i just can't care much about the characters other than max and furiosa.",negative
No Name,4.5,"as an audio/video set piece, it succeeds with great splendor.  i applaud the method of storytelling, using visuals and minor character dialog to explain things instead of railroading the viewer into forced storytelling where every single thing has to be spelled out.  they leave things up to interpretation, as more movies should.  let people internalize things differently, sometimes that can be more interesting and feels more personal.  i feel strongly compelled to re-buy this movie in 4k, the visuals were already fantastic in 1080p but i can only imagine in hdr.  also this movie has some incredible atmos implementation, don't skip this if you're a home theater enthusiast!",positive

No Name,5.0,"this is almost a perfect movie.  it is over the top and accepts it, yet still somehow stays serious.  mad max knows what it is and doesn't try to be something different.  visually amazing, and a nice nod to the 80's movies while being its own thing.  loved it.",positive
No Name,5.0,"this movie has non-stop action but its stimulating, energetic and never feels exhausting or monotonous. the score is absolutely breathtaking in tone. watch this one on a big screen with decent audio if you can.",positive
No Name,3.0,"it's really well made and any individual 20 minutes of it are great, but it's also kind of one long action scene and by the end it's really hard to be at all invested.  i probably should have broken this one into chunks and watched it over a few days, i think that's what i'd recommend.",negative

No Name,3.0,"mad max delivers as an action movie. but those calling it an ""instant classic"" need to calm down. mad max is a visually imaginative, pulse-pounding spectacle, but it certainly has none of the subtle, all time great acting performances that made films like the godfather true film classics that appeal to nearly everyone. mad max is unique enough to set itself apart from the usual action flick, but the story isn't that great.",positive
No Name,4.0,"the action alone is what makes this movie, which is directed very pristinely for the most part. it really slowed down in the middle but other than that it was entertaining. while i couldn't get behind other characters as much and wasn't entirely on board with the universe and the craziness surrounding it, i didn't feel like i needed to! i still liked tom hardy's character quite a bit though. it's one of the better action movies i've seen for sure!",positive

No Name,2.0,"if you like non-stop action in the form of never ending chases, fiery explosions, savage killings and general mayhem, mad max: fury road is probably right up your alley.  if you like movies with meticulously developed characters, a compelling story and intelligent dialogue, you should probably take a pass on george miller's most recent installment in the franchise.  the stunts and special effects are remarkable and much of the cinematography is excellent, but the continual parade of bodies flying through the air, vehicles exploding in balls of flame and characters mumbling incoherently grows repetitive after a short time, making it an exhausting experience at best.  despite the widespread praise that's been heaped on fury road, it's clearly not for all tastes.",negative
No Name,5.0,"como amante de las películas de acción, esta obra de arte es un ""must"" en la lísta de cualquier cinéfilo. desde principio a fin tiene una dosis extremadamente alta de acción. no hay muchos diálogos... pero a quién le importa cuando no hay tiempo para ellos. fantástica ambientación post-apocaliptica i desarrollo de la trama. sin duda: ¡excelente!",positive

No Name,5.0,greatest. action. movie. ever. made.,positive
No Name,5.0,"the opening monologue given to us by tom hardy is probably one of my top 5 moments in film history. it's so well written and beautifully delivered and it goes so well with what's actually happening on the screen. what a great start to an even greater film!  i think one of the most unique and intriguing things about mad max: fury road as a whole is the way it's filmed. it's beautifully shot but it's very different from other movies. there's times where it'll speed up, and while the dialogue is at normal speed, the scene in the background is at 1.5x speed. super unique and i love it!  this cinematography! good heavens i'm in love with the colors and the angles and the shaky effect… gosh it is so visually pleasing. when i first watched this i didn't quite have my ""directors eye"" (as some might call it) but upon rewatch i'm absolutely in love with the camerawork in every scene. i can't get over this cinematography. the colors are just so stunning, especially when it switches from orange to blue. so so great.  the jumps and transitions between scenes is perfection. the pacing overall is actually amazing and i'd say that this is the most intricately timed film i've seen which makes watching super enjoyable.  i'm also in love with this score. it's at times rock music which gets you hyped but at other times it's an orchestra playing a somber song… perfectly split between exciting and devastating. the music itself is extremely emotional and will bring you into what the characters are feeling whether it be excitement or trauma. let me reiterate this, the score is phenomenal. there's simply no other word to describe it.  an underrated(?) part of this film are the vfx! every time a car would blow up or blood would spill i was blown away by how real it looked. you can tell a lot of time was spent focusing on the visual aspects but especially the visual effects!  no one could direct this the way george miller did. mad max: fury road could only be written, produced, and directed by a mad man, and george miller proved his worth. arguably better than its predecessors, fury road is revolutionary. it's a film that could bring you into the realm of film, as it is perfect in near every aspect. it will make you love cinematography, will show you what a films score can really be, provides a wonderful example of the different forms of acting, and so much more. i somehow forgot how good this film really is. absolutely amazing, 10/10!",positive
No Name,4.0,"lo que hace impecable a esta versión de ""mad max"" esta en como george miller, desde el primer minuto da exposición a la historia que quiere contar. sin enredar o alargar innecesariamente la trama. donde desde los primeros 10 minutos dan foco a todo lo que va a ser fundamental en la trama, ya sean personajes locaciones y hasta cosas que parecen tan banales que en como avanza la historia se vuelven fundamentales, usando de una increíble manera el ""es mejor mostrar que decir"", y en eso se basa la mayor parte la película, buscando que en los planos mismos se desaten los sentimientos y el porque de las cosas, ya que en ellos recae todo el peso de la historia. donde todos hacen un trabajo extraordinario entendiendo a los mismos. ya sean los actores, los encargados de vestuario, los extras y los directores de cámara. uniéndose de gran manera para crear una experiencia única. el mundo de mad max es interesante en todo aspecto. esta película se a vuelto una de esas películas que cada vez se vuelven mas escasas, una película que busca la genialidad en el entorno, en donde se desarrollan los acontecimientos de la trama y de ahí partir para profundizar todo lo demás. una película que enamora con la vista.",positive

No Name,3.5,"this movie was clearly a vehicle to introduce charlize theron as the next lead in the franchise. otherwise, why does her role exponentially supersede that of tom hardy as the titular character.  is this a great action movie? yes. is it thrilling with great action sequences and effects? most definitely.  pitfalls are the less than stellar dialogue and the forgettable supporting characters.   but i guess we don't watch action flicks for their stellar dialogue or storytelling.  oh well! it was at least entertaining.",positive

No Name,4.0,"like a lot of people i didn't really know what to expect with this reboot. but also as with a lot of people i was pleasantly surprised.   the visuals in this movie are very well done and more than compliment the setting of a post-apocalyptical wasteland. obviously taking the visual style of mad max 2 and giving it an enhancement with some borderlands vibes thrown in which i'm a big fan of.  my only true peeve is that max's character is rather flat. but this is forgiven by the fact we get some great character development with furiosa and nux.  also the high octane fight scene that consumes majority of the film, despite being very well shot, does tend to make one start to feel like zoning out. but to be honest i think that's just a me thing.",positive
No Name,1.0,one of the worst movies i've ever seen.  it has nothing to do with mad max and has zero story line.  i think the screenwriters dropped acid before they wrote this pathetic script.,negative
No Name,4.0,"a fun and surprisingly exciting narrative that has only a few minor flaws, particularly with its scope and sometimes less-explained side characters. fury road made a real impact, probably much greater than the original mad max, but even for its impact, there are definite points near the end where you'll start to ask to get off the ride.",positive
No Name,5.0,"mad max: fury road is basically a 2-hour long action scene. this movie barely ever stops, the plot is always advancing forward. all the action scenes are insane, unique and exciting. the story itself is also interesting and i found myself rooting for the protagonists. and i really liked how all the characters very useful and were helping each other. the ""damsel in distress"" trope has been subversed excellently.",positive

No Name,0.5,"i have never been this disappointed in a film for which i had expected so little. this film ham-handedly delivers half-baked social and political commentary where the main character speaks all of about five words and the action seems like it was composed by a puberty-crazed twelve year old boy on cocaine, copious amounts of cocaine. i found myself somewhere between indignant anger and hysterical laughter as i watched this train wreck of a movie that people were lauding as an artistic masterpiece. i am afraid that watching this film may have more adverse effects on cognitive development than a year drinking flint, michigan tap water.",negative

No Name,3.5,"the road warrior is one of the most iconic films of the 20th century.  making a subsequent film, without mel gibson, 40+ years later was a gamble for george miller. it is not the road warrior but it is good.  tom hardy is good as max, but, oddly a second player to charlize theron's lead character. she is bold and good as the female leader rescuing the wives of the central cult like villain.  she is clearly the 21st century, female embodiment of the original max-this is evidenced by her early mimic of the road warrior dialogue.  much of this post apocalyptic wasteland is familiar and brutal.   the madness, violence, scarcity, and perversity are all out of miller's universe. the cinematography is spotty at times, and too frenetic for my taste.  the vehicular chases and related effects are stunning.  the theme of female empowerment is great.  worth the roller coaster ride.",positive

No Name,5.0,"five stars, naturally. even with multiple viewings, mad max never ceases to entertain and amaze. great cinematography, direction, acting, action, world-building, writing, everything. who knew a 2 hour car chase through the desert could be such a bananas-engaging story.",positive
No Name,4.5,"the stunts, choreography, effects, set design, and costume design more than make up for the minimal story here. charlize theron is excellent and tom hardy is fine (not that he had a lot to work with). it takes its simple premise and executes it nearly flawlessly and i love all of the female empowerment throughout. like, yeah, i'm completely sold that a dozen badass women are gonna come destroy capitalism and save the world. i'm all for it; let's go already. this movie is like watching olympic gymnasts try to murder each other, which is basically exactly what it is. it's extremely action-heavy, but all of the choreography is so unique and well-done that it's incredibly engaging. the battles between characters are ridiculous and impractical, but the movie makes the world feel alien enough that it doesn't stand out as distracting, just as freaking awesome. the violence is brutal but oh-so-satisfying. the set pieces are all really impressive and each location feels different, despite having a fairly consistent desert backdrop. it has a few cliches, like how the main characters refuse to die despite having concussions and broken bones that could have killed them dozens of times over. injuries also seem to heal themselves in a matter of minutes, allowing our heroes to continue the fight when they should be immobilized at best. this takes away some of the gritty realism (which sounds ridiculous for this movie, i know) and ultimately hampers a bit of the experience. also, as much as i appreciate the practical effects and lack of cgi, the occasional moments of cgi feel very out of place. that being said, i still love this movie and the visuals will never fail to amaze me. i've never even seen any of the original mad max films, but i just might have to go back and check them out.",positive

No Name,0.5,"i am having a hard time understanding the ratings for this movie - i found it difficult to even finish watching. it was just monotonous action, zero character exposition, and pretty terrible acting by tom hardy, who i normally like.",negative
No Name,4.5,a post apocalyptic movie reboot done right. charlize theron and tom hardy were excellent in their works.,positive
No Name,4.5,"while obviously heavily inspired by mad max 2, a previous entry in the series, it stands well as its own stand alone story. it has considerable better action and a better script than any of the previous movies in the franchise and is with out a doubt one of the greatest action movies ever made. unlike any of the previous mad max films this one also has a black and white which makes this film even more unique and in many ways it improves the overall experience.",positive
No Name,3.0,its a full pop corn action/adventure entertainer,positive
No Name,5.0,death to the patriarchy.,negative
No Name,3.0,"62/100. first things first, this movie is very metal and very steampunk so if you're not into that, you're not going to like this movie. the main thing i didn't like about ‘fury road' is that there are parts that are weird and uncomfortable just for the sake of being weird and uncomfortable. the people in this movie are so detached from humanity yet the movie never explained how humans wavered so far in the first place. also, this movie is predictable especially the third act. this film has an interesting premise and does a good job world building but most of the movie is just car chase after car chase after car chase. when the actors and actresses are able to do their thing, that is when this movie is at its best even though we don't get much of it. as an action movie, it does what action movies are supposed to do in terms of action sequences, but it was not my cup of tea and i'm sure i'm not the only one who thinks this way.",negative
No Name,2.0,horrible movie by itself.  worse movie when you compared to the original mel gibson trilogy.  the movie is simply a big-budget amalgam of the originals. breeders = gasoline from the road warrior & master from thunderdome immortan joe = aunty entity + the humungus nux = the feral kid + jedediah motorcycle gang = toe-cutter + goose  the only surprise is that imperator furiosa so did not die like jessie & warrior woman. the storyline is canned.  the plot is ridiculous.  the non-sequiturs are innumerous.  too bad charlize theron and tom hardy signed up for this version of kingdom of the crystal skull.,negative
No Name,5.0,such gorgeous chaos!,negative
No Name,5.0,powerful. vicious. restless.,negative
No Name,3.5,"it's just pure eye-candy and sound experience. so in terms of testing your home cinema system, great. very entertaining popcorn flick. but the story? men ... very uninspiring and that really hurts the otherwise excellent movie.",negative

No Name,5.0,i don't usually like gory action movies but the stunning visuals and emotional depth of mad max: fury road have earned it a permanent spot on my list of favorite movies,positive
No Name,5.0,best action movie of all time,positive
No Name,4.5,"witness me...  it's been awhile since i watched this movie, and since it's on hbo max, i wanted to relive it.  and i loved this movie. one of the most fun, entertaining, and spectacular action movies that i have ever watched. i was in awe at how they were able to film these long sequences of car chase in the desert.   the first half was unrelenting. two major action sequences made for an intense and fast-moving experience. the editing that focused on the face of the characters created the sense of intensity and craziness. the second half was pretty much the same thing and i was still amazed at the incredible work put into these sequences.   my only problem was that at the middle, the movie slowed down, which was fine initially. however, i felt it took a bit too long. i honestly didn't care much for the characters, and just wanted the action. therefore, the emotion wasn't too much there.   overall, one of the best and relentless action movies that entertaining me from the start to finish. it was quite a fury road indeed. 9/10",positive
No Name,0.5,absolutely terrible. what could you possibly like about this movie?,negative
No Name,3.5,"it's a good movie. hell, it's a great movie-  but it isn't mad max. mad max went mad because of his wife and son's slaughter in the australian outback- this one is just crazy. it's wearing a mask it does not need and simply took the name so it could get traction. demeaning, but ok.   it makes me a bit sad that this wasn't a pick-up of the trilogy, but simply a reboot. this max has no past to me, no reasoning. i could replace him with anyone and not feel different.   that being said, it's a great dystopian film. there are so many good parts and so many interesting implications. i do recommend it.",positive
No Name,2.0,"sure, fury road is boldly beautiful, adds a nice feminine angle to the storyline and includes all the post-apocalyptic trademarks that i expected as an og fan of the original trilogy. but i can't help thinking for a film that was supposed to take the action genre to even greater heights, it really never strayed far from the standard action fare. i'll take a simple story and interesting characters over stunning visuals every time.",positive
No Name,4.5,breathtaking scenery and action sequences. one of the most flawless action films created with cinematography that emerges its viewer into the films dystopian landscape.,positive
Jorge O,5.0,if you get a chance to watch this masterpiece in the movie theater do it. one of the greatest action movies ever made.,positive
No Name,0.5,"awful movie. unless you're the type of person who likes cheesy cgi, bad acting and hackneyed storyline. oh wait, they have a really long desert car chase scene with fake cgi explosions. cool. watch the original instead.",negative
No Name,3.0,the movie was ok.. bad cgi sometimes. the end sucked in my opinion. i like the fast paced scenes.,negative
David Benjamin Judah,5.0,the best action movie ever made!!!!!,positive
No Name,5.0,an action masterpiece. unique designs and ideas.,positive
No Name,5.0,"rating: a+  director: george miller  mad max: fury road is one of those films were you literally can't look away, cause there just is to much in every frame that you could miss. tom hardy and charlize theron lead the ensemble cast and the two of them have an amazing chemistry. i gotta say that nicholas hoult delivered an breakthrough performance. the screenplay is great ( unlike in many other blockbusters ) and miller's direction is even better. there definitely has to be props to the stunt team too cause what they did is nothing but brilliant. the sound, costumes, production design and editing were really great too. but i think the 6 academy awards speak for themselves.",positive

No Name,5.0,"mayor, the film is action from start to finish without losing a beat in no time, the script is great, the photography is stunning, the direction is perfect and the performances are to be admired, mad max estrada from fury is a practically perfect film .",positive
No Name,4.5,"it may take someone with modern film taste to appreciate, but after a few revisits and reflection, you'll realize that the feminism, visuals, thrills, and story deserve at the praise it gets.",positive
No Name,3.5,watch it in black and white it'll blow you away!,positive
No Name,4.0,"really pleasantly surprised at this movie. the supporting cast really saves this movie because other than max looking and pulling off some christopher lambart looks and body language, his character development was rather weak compared to the others. thats ok though because you are a mad max fan that knows this mans story inside out. otherwise, its the wheel for you.... you know the rule.  bust a deal. face the wheel.  witness meeeee!",positive
No Name,5.0,great action settled in a dystopian world you must love and fear for its madness.,negative
No Name,4.5,"glorious spectacle, far greater than anything that came before it in the mad max series.",positive
No Name,5.0,this is one of the best movies ever in history and futer made! mad max fury road is fck masterpiece!,positive
No Name,5.0,"max mad fury road is brilliant! the way it recreates and updates the post apocalyptic world from the original films is spectacular. and it's new story and characters make it stand out in ways the original(s) did not. the camera shots are thoughtful and unique. the colors are bright and genuine to life and along with the non-stop action, pull the viewer in making you feel like you're right there with the characters on screen. even if you're not a fan of action movies the sheer artistry of max max fury road will demand your full attention (and make your jaw drop). all reboots should be this great.  keep your fingers crossed for a sequel because you will want to see more (*and hopefully it will have the same actors because recasting the actors destroys a film's contiunity and it's character's integrity and appeal).",positive
No Name,5.0,"it is the word ""action"" translated into film language. the truly good history behind the raw universe of george miller. 10/10",positive
No Name,5.0,truly a masterpiece.,positive
No Name,4.5,"a true accomplishment of unforgettable cinematic action experience, a simple story glows and becomes one to follow. among the barren, dusty and helpless world we’re thrown into comes something substantial. and once you dust yourself off, only a big grasp of air will return you back from the edge of your seat",positive

No Name,5.0,awesome. worth a rewatch. 3rd watch 2/13/21,positive
No Name,2.0,"don't get mad but i thought this movie kinda sucked. yes, the action was pretty great and the reasons behind some of the character's decisions are actually really well thought out and believable. but besides that, the rest of the movie sucked. there was no drama, the acting was pretty bad (except nicholas hoult), the way the characters were sped up was both cringey and unsatisfying and the movie had like zero levity. like, can't someone spit out a joke for once? literally everyone is serious af and it's a f'n mad max movie! anyways, this movie felt bland in literally everything except the action. and it's cool if you like this movie just for the action, but it just isn't my cup of tea.",negative
No Name,5.0,"this film still hits well after all these years. whether your watching it in color on a date at a theatre or ""black & chrome"" at home , the cinematography , the pace, the cuts, the story, the explosions, the sex and zest - are all to die for. this is what hollywood movies are made of and for.  if you can get your hands on it, see the black & chrome silent cut - not available through streaming (i learned the hard way). i caught an abridged version on youtube instead, as i decided to retread down fury road, far away from my 1st viewing at the magic johnson theater, and still loved every second of my experience. - audiomack.com/cvrthebard",positive
No Name,3.5,"this is a solid action movie with some well done special effects and a few very beautiful landscape shots that really help create the dystopian world the movie is set in. the casting was great and what emotion there was, felt genuine. my biggest issue with this movie was there is no explanation of back story. i went into this movie having not seen any previous mad max movies and the movie plays out as if the audience is already well aware of max's backstory (including a sub plot with a hallucination of a girl which i still don't get). since the last movie in the series came out in 1985, i was hoping that backstory would be re-established (seriously, a 5-10 minute flash back at the beginning of the movie would've been awesome). instead you are dropped into the movie and it took 20 minutes before i was really hooked. i feel that one piece alone would've helped my movie experience incredibly. all that aside, it's was still a great movie and i look forward to the next installment. i will probably go back and watch the old ones as well. if you are planning on watching this movie it is very well worth it but i suggest you try to get the backstory first.",negative
No Name,3.0,"a theatre circus act of a movie, overly numerous and stretched poignancies, implausablability, chartoonish characters, neverending chase scenes, debauched nuances and unbelievable premises mean this is a film that is a spectacle of how spectacular you can make something, not a film with a story.",negative
No Name,4.5,"great ""antihero"" movie",negative
No Name,5.0,"this is a classic, it pays respect to the main character, the scenes are beautiful and flow well, the film keeps you watching and there's never a dull moment. this is how you do a female lead, she is strong but not flawless and does not win every fight. she is the opposite of a mary sue which is how it should be done.",positive
No Name,5.0,a classic story about overthrowing old and overreaching power in a beautiful dystopian world. highly recommended.,positive

No Name,2.0,"underneath the exaggerated punk fabrications and childish stunts a banal story tries to make it over the line. i drifted in and drifted out much like i do spending 2 hours on our ride on mower doing the back paddock. might have worked better as an exhibition of stills photos. but i  was encouraged by reviews that hurled, 'epic', 'post-apocalyptic', 'cinematic art', 'visceral'... i would gladly have done with less of those, for something interesting and emotional engaging characters. that said, heroes and heroines were very attractive and villains not. diesel panto.",negative
No Name,5.0,probably the greatest action movie of all time.,positive
No Name,4.5,visually stunning. i wish it had a little more plot and backstory on some of the characters. otherwise mesmerizing.,positive
No Name,5.0,"fury road might be the best post-apocalyptic action film ever made! you don’t get a break for at least an hour, and it’s not enough of one to catch your breath. it’s packed with style, relentlessly bleak, brutal, and high-octane with sparse and bizarre dialog like the original mad max, but i think the story concept is more interesting. excellent costumes, score and sound design, stunts, characters, direction, acting, editing, props, vehicles, cinematography, and scenery. i think i’ve watched it at least once every year since it came out, and i can’t think of anything that would make it better. i wish i had seen it in a theater!",positive

No Name,0.5,"love the original mad max but i don't understand why people like this. i know there is nuance story to it and i don't doubt that at all. but the action i cannot understand why people praise it so much. max does barley any fighting at all compared to the original 3 and the only action that is in it is people chucking explosive spears at cars. thats it! maybe 1 scene with max using his shotgun or furiosa using a pistol or something. basically the film is drive to point a, get spears chucked at them, reach point b, realise they got to go back to point a, drives back to point a, gets hit by more spears, reaches point a again, frees people. there ya go thats the film.   and i love the actors and actresses in this film but max isn't max anymore. he just grunts and nods and has zero character. fanboys will say he doesn't say much in the originals but if you watch them again you will see not only are you wrong but there is so much story to him in the originals that even his grunts or nods mean a lot more in those films then the words max finally gets to utter in this film. tom hardy could be a great successor to mel gibson but the writing of the character ruined it. no longer is he the angry but smart and kind of charismatic loner from the first film, now he is just a moody guy that just does things.",negative

No Name,2.5,it's a decent movie but it should have been it's own thing. it capitalizes on a known title (poorly) to tell a bare bones story. it's visually interesting & has some cool moments but overall seems like a mismanaged idea.,negative
No Name,5.0,"this movie is just great, the story doesn't make any sense, but that's also just adds to the fun of watching this movie. it also makes me laugh when i just think of how filming this movie must have been, because (almost) nothing in this movie was made with a computer.",positive
No Name,3.5,"fun movie, good effects. charlize theron is excellent.",positive
No Name,3.0,"visually appealing with a good cast and acting, but excessive focus on action over plot.  they certainly accomplish the creation of a dystopian world that is interesting.  the vehicles, the citadel, and the mechanics of things are impressive.  to me, you just have this set of interesting characters that you don't know really anything about, so you don't fully appreciate their actions and motivations.  you don't get a chance to get emotionally involved because it's a stranger you just met.  i would have preferred the film to be split over 2-3 individual films in more of a peter jackson format of developing the characters over time but shot at once.",negative

No Name,5.0,"potent, technical, stunning, wild, these are some adjectives that describe this feature. mad max: fury road is a complete chaos orchestrated by human beings in their most ambiguous insanity in a post-apocalyptic world. george miller created an extremely fascinating, perverse, and brutal work, portraying a world where people are at their emotional, physical, and especially mental limits. the first feature, 1979's mad max, came with a somewhat daring proposal, where the focus would be on unbridled action in an australia where the streets were taken by people and their vehicles in a state of madness, and at the same time that max (played by mel gibson), a police officer respected by his comrades and the city where he works, sees himself with his ideals coming to the fore when he goes through an experience that will shake his life forever. with the original trilogy finished in mad max beyond thunderdome (mad max - beyond the thunder dome) in 1985, it was 28 years before the filming of the new feature started, which started in july 2012 in namibia, and was released in 2015. there was an expectation coming from a director like george miller, but as images and trailer were being released, it became a work with great potential, and this was realized with its release, only the maximum potential of everything was raised. what was expected. the experience of experiencing (or rather saying ""witnessing"") this feature in a movie theater, was certainly one of the best things of that year. mad max: fury road is one of the best films of 2015, and of the past decade, the biggest and best action film in the history of cinema.",positive
