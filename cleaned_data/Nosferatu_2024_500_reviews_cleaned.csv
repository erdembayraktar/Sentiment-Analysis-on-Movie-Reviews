Name,Rating,Review
No Name,5.0,"being a fan of the 1922, 1979, and other interpretations, i viewed nosferatu 2024 hoping that robert eggers would pay appropriate tribute to the story, as well as making this one feel different, and purposeful. what i got was a remake that doesn't try to outdo any of the other films, but pay appropriate tribute to them as well as creating a different experience, one that is eery and technically impressive.  yes, technically it is a gorgeous film, despite it being dreary. it's a world of 1838 before electricity. rooms are dark. crackling fires and candles make up the light. muted colors fill out the palette. camerawork and sound put you in the world of this vampire who can ingrain fear into people. apart from these achievements, the way the story unfolds is risky. it asks the audience to be involved and to understand character motivations (which help if you know the original nosferatu), but also to understand the time setting and how the actors are portraying their characters, which tends to be very theatrical. very much silent film acting.   for many people, it just won't be a film for them. their idea of this film dragging on, is my idea of enjoying the world that was created. their absence of seeing character motivations or visual cues are things that fans of the original movie might understand a bit more. like a silent movie, this sound version still wants the audience to participate with their mind. i will concede that it won't work for everyone, but to me, it was an incredible viewing experience."
Kenton,5.0,the cinematography and settings were fantastic.  the count was truly menacing.  reminds me of the old horror movies that i grew up watching.  much more gory and graphic however.
Azia,2.5,so sexually charged. is that the under lining meaning of nosferatu? kinda turned me off from it.. ha the irony
No Name,2.0,"a slow burn gothic tale with lots of atmosphere.  however, this all feels a little too familiar after great movies, such as bram stoker's dracula.  i definitely found it lacking in the horror suspense department.  if you like gothic period pieces, this might entertain you..  if you are looking for a good fright night, it's a lacking."
No Name,1.0,slow boring over acted and filmed mainly in darkness it‚Äôs crippling tedious. every scene is drawn out and overacted. it‚Äôs like each actor was told to reenact a school hamlet play. not scary. just tedious. would have been better to just watch one of the old dracula films from the 1940‚Äôs. looked the same and probably more scary. absolute waste of money.
No Name,5.0,"stylish, cinematic, horrific. every actor was a pro! lilli was brilliant! they don't make films like this anymore! oscar material."
Mothermayeye,1.0,"i was so utterly let down by this movie.  found myself saying ""why? why? why?"" a lot through out the lengthy film.  dr. robotnik?  faking seizures?  why?  visually stunning?  we left early only to go home and watch interview with a vampire.  kirsten dunst, iconic performance.  i give flowers where they are due and this was a waste of 30."
Jared,4.0,excellent cinematography and a great soundtrack set the dreary mood of this movie. the characters portrayed a sense of dread and despair that was quite convincing as a viewer.
Bryan P,3.0,disjointed. glitches in storyline.
No Name,5.0,"el romance g√≥tico y las historias no estaban en mi entendimiento, y nosferatu me emergi√≥ en la historia de amor que se explica de una manera perturbadora y bella. muestra que no siempre el romance es hermoso, puede ser obsesivo y tr√°gico, esta pel√≠cula explica perfectamente esa idea, no es lenta y en el transcurso deja clara cada idea. una m√°ster class de imagen, audio e interpretaci√≥n."
No Name,4.5,"wow, what a movie! eggers crushes this one and makes the 2h+ time commitment a heck of a ride that's well worth it. the casting choices made sense and the plot/storytelling lured you in right away.  from a technical standpoint - production design, photography, makeup & costume design, this team puts on a breathtaking masterpiece that's both terrifying and stunning to look at.   we can stop making vampire movies, this one's execution would be very difficult to surpass. well done, nosferatu team!"
Vixen,5.0,"absolutely wonderful, perfect amount of jump scares, but more importantly captured a ton of the true elements of the nosferatu"
No Name,0.5,"i anticipated the movie to be a true horror movie, during the movie i found myself as well as other people laughing at certain scenes. despite the vulgar scenes and story lines i am sad to say i rated this movie a 4/10. although the characters were great the story was a miss."
Chris J,2.0,"molasses slow retelling of the original nosferatu. neither engaging or scary... atmospheric, yes. very darkly lit. the count is menacing but not scary. completely anticlimactic end. willem dafoe is a favorite actor but he took me out of the film. his wig was poor and his style of acting necessitates others around him are in the same space. they were not.  just really droll and unnecessary."
No Name,5.0,the best adaptation of nosferatu. cant wait for the 4k extended cut steelbook
No Name,1.0,"it‚Äôs a well made movie, but just not good. the dialog is overdone, too many story lines, and just a very very slow movie."
No Name,1.0,"i have to say that i thought it was essentially a re-newed version if bram stoker's film dracula, the similarities are almost too many. i preferred that to this. sorry, not my cup of tea at all. üòí"
Bunnie,4.0,much different filming format than other previous vampire movies but definitely worthy of all the praises it's been receiving.
No Name,4.0,"as a fan of the horror genre, i was pleasantly surprised with this movie take on the beloved origin story. the movie was well-written and the cast was amazing a worthy watch for horror fans."
No Name,5.0,if you like the classic hammer horror films you will love this. if you don‚Äôt you probably won‚Äôt like it. one of the best horror movies i have seen in a while.
No Name,5.0,"i loved this movie from start to finish, amazing work from everyone that worked in it.  from the effects, the designs of the clothes, the acting to the pacing of the story everything was tailored and curated in the best way! one of the best film i saw in the last year!"
No Name,2.0,bill was average. could have saved heaps by having his brother gustav play the role. so many desperate to talk this movie up for some reason. it's not visually incredible but is an overacting masterpiece if that's your thing. ps depps daughter has weirdly large nipples
Noah B,4.0,visually fantastic. great performances. i thought the writing didnt match the rest but overall such a great movie.
No Name,1.0,do not believe these reviews. this move has no plot no story nothing at all. trash movie prob was the worst move i watched in theaters.
No Name,1.0,second most boring movie i have ever seen. they should provide night vision goggles just to see what's happening. dialogue was beyond terrible. the only redeemable element was costuming. walk don't run.
Karen g,0.5,"so disappointed! put it this way i didn't even finish it. i walked out before it even ended ughhh good thing went on the cheap day. like get on with it i wanted moreeeeeeee, this was just ughhhhhh no no no"
Nicholas,0.5,too long to introduce william dafoe character. the movie was too long to get to point. not a good picture.
Mary,4.0,stunning cinematography. plot a bit slow
No Name,5.0,"hacer una recreaci√≥n de una joya de culto como nosferatu es un tema de discusi√≥n. lo cierto es que la elecci√≥n de robert eggers como director fue la m√°s correcta porque √©l conoc√≠a la pel√≠cula original y porque si el proyecto hubiese estado a cargo de otro director, el resultado final podr√≠a no haber sido tan agradable. cuando werner herzog hizo su versi√≥n de nosferatu, copio varias cosas evidentes de la pel√≠cula de murnau, pero tambi√©n le dio un toque propio y algunas ideas nuevas para que nosferatu (1979) fuera una aceptable recreaci√≥n del cl√°sico de murnau. con la versi√≥n de robert eggers pasa lo mismo, pero llevado a un nivel m√°s alto. aqu√≠ eggers no copia al 100% la pel√≠cula original, pero narra la misma historia con un toque propio y cambios que le dan a esta versi√≥n un argumento m√°s desarrollado y profundo adentramiento al mismo. como es caracter√≠stico del estilo del director, esta pel√≠cula ofrece una visi√≥n bastante sombr√≠a y con un ritmo lleno de bastante tensi√≥n. al igual que the witch y the lighthouse, la direcci√≥n de eggers hace que esta pel√≠cula se sienta como una pesadilla. hay momentos en que la influencia del conde orlock afecta mentalmente a los personajes al punto de que sienten que est√°n atrapados en una pesadilla de la que no pueden despertar. hay momentos en los que parece que la realidad se distorsiona y genera una sensaci√≥n de tensi√≥n en el ambiente. thomas hutter ya se est√° adentrando en una pesadilla y no es hasta que conoce al conde orlok que comienza a sospechas bastante. en la pel√≠cula de murnau, thomas se mostraba esc√©ptico hasta descubrir lo que orlok era realmente. en la versi√≥n de herzog, √©l ya sospechaba del conde al momento de conocerlo y en esta pel√≠cula pasa eso tambi√©n, pero con m√°s intensidad. el control que orlok tiene sobre ellen es bastante perturbador y es manifestado como algo similar a una posesi√≥n demoniaca. el romanticismo que la pel√≠cula ofrece sobre ellen y orlok parece en parte basarse en lo que coppola hizo con dr√°cula, pero la relaci√≥n entre ellos en esta pel√≠cula es mucho m√°s oscura. el conde orlok de bill skarsgard es mucho m√°s sombr√≠o y siniestro que su contraparte original. pasa mayor parte del tiempo en las sombras y eso lo hace ver mucho m√°s misterioso y t√©trico. el vampiro creado por murnau se basaba m√°s en los strigoi que eran vampiros mucho m√°s horripilantes que un vampiro humano com√∫n. en ese momento, le dieron una apariencia m√°s similar a un roedor por su v√≠nculo con la peste bub√≥nica. el conde orlok de esta pel√≠cula sigue el mismo par√°metro, pero con un dise√±o mucho m√°s grotesco y demacrado. aqu√≠ orlok es un vampiro m√°s cadav√©rico y se siente como un aut√©ntico no-muerto que lleva siglos demacr√°ndose. tambi√©n pudieron dar una breve explicaci√≥n de c√≥mo orlok se convirti√≥ en un no-muerto. el maquillaje es excelente y pudieron brindar una macabra versi√≥n del vampiro nosferatu en su m√°ximo esplendor. el bigote fue sacado de la novela de bram stoker, ya que en ese libro la descripci√≥n de dr√°cula incluye un bigote y es un detalle que muy pocas veces se ha usado. aqu√≠ logro pegar junto con la vestimenta que pone en evidencia la antig√ºedad de la criatura. robert eggers logro agregar m√°s desarrollo a los personajes superando lo que murnau y herzog hab√≠an hecho. la √∫nica diferencia ser√≠a orlok que en la versi√≥n de herzog es m√°s humano y melanc√≥lico. as√≠ como herzog ha ofrecido nuevos momentos memorables para sentirse como una pel√≠cula original, robert eggers hace lo mismo. existen muy buenos planos con maravillosa fotograf√≠a, estupendo vestuario, buen dise√±o de producci√≥n y el correcto uso de luz y sombra. hay escenas que recuerdan un poco al estilo de tim burton. la pel√≠cula se convierte en una obra g√≥tica con escenas perturbadoras, es bastante po√©tica y aterradora. robert eggers supo renovar este cl√°sico tan querido y hacer una pel√≠cula que est√° a la altura de la original. al igual que sus predecesoras, esta pel√≠cula est√° destinada a ser un cl√°sico. nosferatu (2024) es una bella pel√≠cula art√≠stica, un cuento g√≥tico que revive el arte del vampirismo en el cine y una digna sucesora de la obra de murnau. una prueba irrefutable de que nosferatu logr√≥ seguir perdurando en el tiempo, a pesar de haber pasado 100 a√±os. mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 10/10."
Louis,5.0,one of the best movies ive seen in years. the acting is fantastic. nosferatus voice is perfection.
No Name,3.0,not enough bats for me
No Name,2.0,boring till the last 3rd of movie. kinda corny.
No Name,5.0,"i imagine many a hollywood veteran director/producer are green with evey towards mr. roger eggers, in the same way hollywood h8s jim cameron.....since egger's films rival many & more of the flopbuster & indeed blockbusters of the 20's  oh & nosferatu is great, it goes without saying. a must-see in the theaters gt me to go back to the movies, i can tell you that. )"
Adam,0.5,not worth the money or time. twilight knock off. expected horror being as the original vampire.  more of a sappy love story‚Ä¶ should have streamed instead. save your money
Nichole P,4.0,faired well to the original 1922. just a bit much on the sex and nudity. overall it was great.
No Name,2.0,"i was very disappointed. i found it kind of funny, kind of boring. no chills for me."
Matthew,3.5,definitely the best modern interpretation of the dracula mythos. the first half will have you remembering your first read of dracula. the back half is kind of wonky but we'll shot and acted thru and thru
H Alan R,2.5,interesting but very slow.  didn‚Äôt live up to the hype though
No Name,5.0,"i love it, it‚Äôs a incredible movie with outstanding cinematography and visuals and score and terrific performances by the entire cast specially by deep and skarsg√•rd and of course the amazing and unique direction by eggers."
Thierry,2.0,not a great version of a well known story with a lack of unexpected turns
Virginia B,1.5,"the screenplay didn‚Äôt build the characters enough, because i cared about no one. seemed more focused on demon possession, than vampirism. there were a couple of hopeful moments, but not enough for me to want to recommend it even on streaming."
Andre V,5.0,thank you for this cinematic masterpiece mr eggers !
walla,3.5,"solid cinematography its disgustingly horrifying a bit sexual , a different take on an age old story"
bj,3.5,a little long. too much nudity. amazing cinematic artistry!
No Name,2.0,this director is always a visionary.. but the acting (with exception of nicholas hoult and a few others) is almost to the point of soap opera. i‚Äôm a huge fan of ‚Äúthe light house‚Äù but this was not worth the watch and length of time.
Garrett,4.0,it was a pretty good remake. it is definitely worth the watch.
No Name,0.5,"huge vampire fan. read everything and watched everything imagineable but my gosh was this movie horrendous. terrible script, jumped around and made zero sense. lily was a very poor actress and bills accent for this movie was all over the place and at times i missed what he was even saying. aaron taylor johnsons acting was the only saving grace for this movie. the scene setting was abysmal how you can have a movie last as long at this one and it be poor at setting scenes is ridiculous, nothing makes you care about any character in this movie. saw a few people leave the cinema at different points which i've never experienced before but came as little surprise. i was glad when it was over."
James B T,5.0,a little bit slow in the middle but great ending  would have liked to see more of nosferatu full gore
Joe,5.0,excellent  .... done right
No Name,1.5,"meh, wait for cable, had high expectations but not delivered."
No Name,2.0,"i thought that was more frighting and scary, but instead it was more awkward, i expected a scary movie not this"
Jeffery,5.0,great atmospheric movie. count orloc is gruesome as ever.
Mary,3.0,same standard dracula story with different names for the characters.
Maria y Juan G,5.0,"just so good, we loved every minute of it"
No Name,3.0,"visually stylish, but a movie you‚Äôll either love or think is severely overrated. if you are not the biggest fan of eggers work, you‚Äôll think the ladder"
No Name,1.0,"the scariest part for me was that it almost bored me to death. and that ending... who came up with that? seriously. can't recommend it. which is really sad because i had high hopes for it. don't get me wrong - i loved the original, liked a lot of the pictures but all in all the story was extremly slow and it was very hard for me to stay awake most of the time.. :-("
No Name,1.5,"super boring. they forgot the plot. copy/paste of bram stoker dracula, which was also boring. nice cinematography. dialog seems contrived, and that‚Äôs coming from someone who enjoyed the witch. i think eggers needs to go back to low budget, this felt like an ultra produced nothing burger."
No Name,3.0,poor script. the story jumps around too much for its own good. visually astounding
John,5.0,loved the plot and cinematography best vampire movie i think i‚Äôve ever seen
Alexander S,5.0,"second row imax put me in the movie and it was a great telling of the tale. eggers really delivers a sort of descent that relies on rich sensory experiences and no horror gimmicks.  see this in imax, as close as you can stand, so that the image and sound overwhelm.  when count orlock looms above you, youll understand"
Brianna,5.0,this was a masterpiece had us hooked through the whole thing
No Name,1.0,it's very rare that we walk out of a movie. we weren't the only ones either. with a stellar cast i'd expecting something really good. it was just a poor hammer house of horror type movie. visuals similar to some of those on the dracula movie with val kilmer. shame really as it had potential
No Name,3.0,very stylish and engaging version of the classic dracula story but rather plodding at times.
Alex,4.0,visually stunning in true robert eggers fashion.  stellar acting performances all around.  it was a little longer than it needed to be but an overall great movie.
Ronald,1.0,"poor script, story jumped around to much. to dark i assume to hide the poor stage props. ""dark shadows"" was done better than this movie"
Boyle M,2.5,movie was silly. visually great. just another robert eggers movie.
Jarell W,3.5,"adequate remake of a film from the 1920s. i am a lover of vampire movies, so the bias probably added an extra star. the tone and atmosphere were outstanding, yet the plot was problematic when focusing on the character thomas hutter (nicolas hoult), who seemed to make the worse decisions imaginable. although i guess his idiocy was necessary to drive the plot forward. overall the movie was worth seeing, but isn‚Äôt something i will revisit often."
No Name,0.5,terrible watch. needs to be rated at least ma15+ for the gore. while the visuals and effects were great they were not met with an ounce of storyline.
No Name,4.5,this movie is simply amazing
No Name,4.0,pretty swag. vampire looks hella gnarly.
Jasaire,5.0,"wowsers!!! this is in no way like the 1920s version. i love the creativity of the story, realistic graphics and make up. in my opinion, i think this movie is great for halloween, a spooky valentine's day or any day of the year. i will definitely see this movie again."
No Name,3.5,"another dracula movie? pshaw..... nevermind! upon watching i was actually pleasantly surprised.  this is the only major adaptation that actually does a halfway decent job at recreating the novel. major props for the sets and atmosphere, takes itself a little too seriously in the acting department sometimes but has a satisfying runtime and resolution. i enjoyed dafoe a lot in this."
No Name,5.0,"it was a beautiful movie, every scene was magnificent. i truly loved this film"
Itza,5.0,it was a great movie very relaxing to watch and entertaining.  i recommend it 100%
Ben W,4.0,"visually beautiful. story was gripping, although the dracula/vampire story has been told time and time again. good effects, great acting (other than aaron taylor johnson), excellent visuals and cinematography, etc, etc. can be slow at times, but i always appreciate a slow burn."
No Name,3.5,"hauntingly beautiful, and worth it for the visuals alone."
Robyn B,5.0,"amazing cinematography, settings, costumes, and overall creepiness!"
No Name,5.0,"it creeps under your skin. a visually stunning adaptation of 1922 nosferatu that honours the original whilst introducing new layers to it, making it a complex alluring gothic horror masterpiece."
Keishon,5.0,probably one of the best horror films i have ever watched!
slipkid99 L,3.0,i thought the ending was a bit anticlimactic.
No Name,5.0,imax viewing was so intense. im not a scary movie guy but i love films. i did not have any back story other than knowing what a vampire is and i was on edge the whole film. i dont think ill ever watch this again.
No Name,1.0,way too long. boring.
No Name,5.0,"so cinematic and detailed. love the production , little slow but worth watching"
No Name,4.0,"i‚Äôve been a fan of the original silent film ever since they played a 16mm print for us in elementary school, during a rained out recess, and it scared the hell out of me. this film is very true to the original but it also fleshes out the story and characters some more."
Peter,4.0,great movie just not exactly what we expected
No Name,0.5,"we‚Äôve never walked out of a movie before, but we walked out of this one. it was trying to do something but it was just awful. not even willem defoe could save it. the plot is all over the place, so much so that i‚Äôm not sure there even is one. the characters give you no reason to care about them whatsoever. didn‚Äôt even enjoy the cinematography of it. nosferatu is barely in the damn thing.  long, dull, and just plain bad. i don‚Äôt know how they made a famous vampire story boring, but they certainly did."
Masha,1.0,honestly was very boring.
No Name,4.0,well crafted and will definitely be seeing a second time!
Michael,5.0,great movie and time spent with my daughter in a comfortable theatre.
No Name,5.0,a masterpiece. it‚Äôs in my top 3 vampire movies.
Jeffrey Lang,5.0,this is one of the most absolutely beautiful things i have ever seen. there was not one frame of the film that didn‚Äôt convey the feel and tone of the story.
Greg P,4.0,very scary with impending dread layered throughout. beautifully shot
Jessica,3.5,great movie. i just know a lot of people wouldnt be able to understand it. its filled with social commentary but at the heart is a love story and a womans struggle to feel whole. fantastic acting- the director is incredible.
Kevin K,5.0,"a perfect film in every way. i wish all movies were made this well, with this level of cinematography, acting, and writing."
No Name,4.0,"robert eggers gives us one of the best cinematic horror atmospheres we've seen in a long time  this may not be the definitive version we'll see of nosferatu, but it is the most exciting so far. this is due to robert eggers' signature gothic style and his way of telling the story, with the notion that the vampire is a terrible and terrifying being, without any other characteristic that differentiates him.  this ancient vampire continues to be terrifying, firstly because its director does not romanticize the character, but rather gives him that disturbing and chilling air, and secondly because eggers truly understands that nosferatu does not focus on the supernatural terror of an everlasting creature, but on power. impeccable, malicious, immaculate and destructive power. a film with incredible work (especially its photography), cinematically it is full of references and amazing details.  robert eggers adds a new treasure to his outstanding filmography."
brian h,4.0,"great film, beautifully haunting visuals, touched on so many emotions."
No Name,3.5,i enjoyed this even though it was in the main a retelling of ‚Äúbram stoker‚Äôs dracula‚Äù with keanu reeves & gary oldman.
No Name,0.5,"the only thing i liked was the atmosphere and filming quality and  movement of the camera.   it was showing the nosferatu toooooo much, he was speaking none stop,the way he was breathing sometimes became like comedy movies. for us it was more comedy than horror ."
Dante,5.0,the best bram stoker adaptation to date! bravo!
James,1.5,"boring, hard to understand some characters, too dark."
No Name,4.5,visually stunning. glad i saw it in theaters
No Name,0.5,i hated this movie. cannot recommend it to anyone. it‚Äôs advertised as a horror movie but there is nothing remotely scary about this except maybe the oversexualisation of the women in this movie. honestly this felt more like a porn film than a horror movie. i see what they were trying to do with the creepy and sensual vibes but they just did not execute it well at all. everytime something happens to the female characters in this movie their breasts are out and instead of screaming in pain they‚Äôre moaning in a sensual manner. i have a lot more to say about this movie it was just so bad. however if you go into watching this thinking of it as a comedy it might be a little more bearable to watch.
Thomas,4.5,great special effects
No Name,5.0,"one of the best horror movies of all time... not just that , it's a brilliantly made movie... the language is a little tough to understand but otherwise everything is captivating. a must watch!"
No Name,3.0,"the visuals and cinematography are very good.  the acting from the cast is all very good apart from emma corrin who i thought gave a sub par performance, i don't think she was correctly cast for her role.  i found myself expecting more from the film.  slightly disappointed but still enjoyed watching it - with the visuals still staying with me the next day."
Kenneth D,4.5,feels like the definitive dracula movie (with respect to gary oldman). eggers was the perfect director to bring the book and original movie back to life
Sandra,5.0,visually stunning with odes to the 1920s version.
Prayash,5.0,"the movie was really scary, and it was one of those scary movies where you wanna get up and leave while its happening, and then afterwards youre like woah that was so good!"
Lisa B,5.0,"dark gritty, true horror film"
No Name,4.0,very nice movie.....!!!!
Susan K,4.0,"i loved that the film hinted back to old dracula movies, but the dracula was hard to understand at times.  otherwise, the acting was great and the cinematography was really cool.  i didn't know what to expect and i really liked the film. it could win awards."
Omarr M,4.0,"highy atmospheric, well acted, spectacle, that brings new life to a classic tale.  spectacular cinematography."
No Name,1.0,"the plot moves at an unbearably slow pace, and any scary or suspenseful moments are over almost as soon as they begin, leaving no time for real tension to build. the constant, abrupt scene changes make it hard to stay engaged, and the overall experience feels disjointed. while it has some iconic visuals, the lack of flow and weak pacing made it a chore to watch. i found myself struggling to stay awake. this one might only appeal to film history buffs."
No Name,3.0,"it looks great, has plenty of atmosphere and doesn't drag and i enjoyed simon mcburney and eileen dafoe's performances. but i thought orlok was ridiculously ott as a monster which meant i found him humourous rather than scary, and felt rather sorry for atj who was poor in a thankless and fairly pointless role."
Christopher G,5.0,"very well written, casted, and produced! enjoyed it"
No Name,4.0,gran manera de abordar un tema tan clich√© como lo son los vampiros
Jacob,5.0,i liked the scary guy he was scary to me
No Name,4.0,"a rea√ß√£o de abrir um sorriso ao reconhecer refer√™ncias de diretores que tu admiras influenciando o trabalho de outro dos grandes. a experi√™ncia com a vers√£o de nosferatu de robert eggers √© de sorver o f√¥lego. est√£o presentes elementos da est√©tica g√≥tica, desde a arquitetura da cidade e do castelo do vampiro, at√© a tez alva e o figurino da protagonista. mas, eggers comp√µe o seu nosferatu mais pr√≥ximo a dimens√£o de horror, elemento manifesto na vers√£o de 1922 de murnau, com refer√™ncias a cl√°ssicos do terror como o exorcista de 1973. o diretor mant√©m muitas das caracter√≠sticas de sua filmografia no longa: a pel√≠cula escura que trabalha a luz a partir do destaque, o feixe luminoso que desenha n√£o apenas uma silhueta √† janela, mas um caminho inevit√°vel √† presen√ßa maligna que ali est√°; a composi√ß√£o c√™nica de navios ao mar revolto, tamb√©m manifestos em o farol e o homem do norte; a trilha sonora que encaixa como uma luva, seja para acentuar a sensa√ß√£o de inc√¥modo, seja para antever um jump scare (os quais s√£o bem trabalhados e entram bem na narrativa). lilly rose deep est√° muito bem no papel de ellen. confesso que logo que vi o an√∫ncio da vers√£o de nosferatu do eggers imaginei que anya taylor joy ficaria com o papel, mas lilly conseguiu equilibrar abje√ß√£o, horror e desejo na constru√ß√£o psicol√≥gica de sua personagem. bill skarsg√•rd para al√©m do conde orlock, interpreta o puro mal e o assombro que provoca n√£o √© marcado apenas nos momentos em que o monstro aparece (ali√°s, belo trabalho de maquiagem), mas sua presen√ßa maligna √© representada ainda que em sua aus√™ncia.  pelo inc√¥modo, est√©tica e intranspon√≠vel assombro nessa vers√£o, nosferatu do eggers conquistou meu cora√ß√£o. a compara√ß√£o com o cl√°ssico do murnau √© inevit√°vel, mas precisa ser localizada no per√≠odo hist√≥rico. murnau √© expressionismo alem√£o, uma outra constru√ß√£o de plano. na contemporaneidade, a compara√ß√£o √© desproporcional."
No Name,3.0,"tries to be supremely sinister and tragic and doesn't quite manage it. lovely acting, nice scenery and tone but it doesn't come together. too many elements murk it up. borrows extensively from the gary oldman one. seems like it's going to be clever and a bit weird, but is just a big movie dressed up in gothic tones."
No Name,5.0,"a spectacularly well-made film that i wanted to see again right away after leaving the cinema because i was so distracted by the beauty of each and every shot, i find it difficult to recall the core content and any one particular part of the film.  this film could easily be edited as a silent movie as the soundtrack is also absolute perfection.  the acting has been criticized but i honestly believe there was a need for overacting due to the ambiance and as a further homage to the original film, no single actor stole the show as the star of this film is the film itself. incredible set design and costumes, i can almost guarantee that this film will win at least two oscars, maybe it'll end up with five or six."
PortRow,3.0,"very stylish and the acting is very good, if occasionally a little over the top. the dialogue that count orlok has is overly florid (its a choice to emphasize his being from another time but it bordered on reading silly (he speaks romanian with subtitles) and the direction tends to telegraph when you are going to be jump-scared‚Äîand almost all of the horror is the show build up to a jump-scare or occasionally some gore. im glad i saw it but doubt i will be watching it when its streaming or on tv."
Thomas E,5.0,"very good take on an often told story. the leads were all excellent with the exception of one who has given up acting to play himself, over and over again."
No Name,2.0,"filme ruim mas muito bem feito.  os primeiros 30 minutos prometem muito mas quanto mais o tempo passa, o filme se torna quase uma com√©dia.  apesar de ser lindo visualmente e dos atores entregarem muito, a hist√≥ria √© sem p√© nem cabe√ßa e ao decorrer do filme voc√™ se questiona se est√° captando o sentido ou se de fato, n√£o h√° nenhum.  al√©m disso, o que mais me irritou foi a quantidade de momentos com conota√ß√£o sexual sem necessidade. o filme, em algum momento, passa a ser uma s√©rie de abusos das mulheres protagonistas.  por fim, √© um daqueles filmes pra assistir quando der ""na telha"" e quando sair no streaming. n√£o vale a pena ir ao cinema por ele."
Roger L,5.0,great lighting in film.   good story.  very scary and icky parts   enjoyed it overall.    not a film for grandma   it would scare her lol
No Name,4.0,masterpiece of a remake and another modern classic of robert eggers.
karenAnn,4.0,liked bram stokers dracula better but this was good
No Name,4.0,nosferatu is haunting beautiful.it is a dark fantasy and gothic masterpiece but only for the niche audiences.
Matt F,1.0,"too long and not worth the time. if it was trying to do something better with the dracula story, i missed it. didnt like the old movie and i dont like this one."
No Name,1.0,"i really, really wanted to like this film. i love the original and everything to do with dracula, and i'm a huge fan of gothic cinema, but this movie was a huge disappointment for me. some of the acting was very nicely done, and i can appreciate the atmosphere and the cinematography. and in fact, the first 30 minutes had me believing that it was going to be a fantastic movie. however, the longer it went on, the more the plot got extremely murky. the audience in my theater laughed several times at points that were clearly not meant to be funny, and there were so many plot holes. i also found myself really confused and disheartened by what their thesis wanted to be. it seemed like they wanted to say something about sexual assault, but didn't have a clear point. the fact that she ""sacrifices herself"" at the end made me wonder if they knew what message they wanted to get across at all, or if they only wanted to show the bleakness of a woman being assaulted multiple times just for the sake of it. i would say that i would rewatch it to try to figure it out, but i don't think i could subject myself to that again. and not to mention the horrible mustache. he looked like waluigi. bad all around. its only saving grace was willem dafoe. without him and his performance, i might even call it unwatchable. i had to rewatch the 1930s dracula when i got home just to cleanse my pallet."
No Name,4.0,"el cine expresionista regreso en forma de ficha.  el regreso del joven maestro roberto eggers en su s√©ptima pelicula dirigida reimaginando la pel√≠cula nosferatu una de las abanderadas adaptaciones del cine expresionista de los 20s. con una reimaginacion del mito de dracula en el cine. invita a el espectador a abrir la mente a el significado del mito del monstruo maldito, desde un punto esot√©rico/ oculitista. y de  la  mano de una fotogr√°fica ambiental y un sonido que abraza la idea de llevar a lo m√°s oscuro el mito del relato t√©trico rom√°ntico de dracula de bram stoker. una pel√≠cula üé• para los amantes del cine que requiere reflexion y paciencia."
No Name,5.0,fantastic horror movie
No Name,5.0,"great film!!!!!!!! second best nosferatu, right after spongebob."
Erica,5.0,10/10 super freaky and loved the male cast üòõ
Devon P,5.0,"amazing cinematography, directing, casting, locations, and costuming. note that although nasferatu is not a horror movie, it is still extremely visceral in style and not for the weak.   if you are into film and cinematography like myself, i highly recommend it. it deserves an academy award."
Deryk,5.0,superb acting. love that they stuck somewhat to the original movie!
No Name,3.0,lovely cinematography but i felt like it was unnecessarily grotesque sometimes.
VM,1.0,was really impressed with lily rose depp‚Äôs performance. the movie however was a disappointment.
Srikrishnan R,1.0,very very boring.  the first movie that i've actually ever walked out on
Justin,4.0,"having never seen the original silent movie, i didn‚Äôt know what to think going into this movie. the movie is basically a retelling of the novel ‚Äúdracula‚Äù by bram stoker. for the most part the movie stays true to the source material, while changing a couple things to make it stand on its own. while not terrifying, it‚Äôs definitely grotesque & interesting enough to keep you glued to the screen. i appreciate that you don‚Äôt really see the main antagonist count orlok (the vampire). the actors did such a great job especially willem defoe who always shines in whatever role he plays. the one down side i would point out is sometimes the lore is a little hard to follow towards the end. one instance was how they explained how the vampire curse actually works. other than that this is a solid movie that would recommend seeing in theaters over waiting for it to hit streaming platforms."
Clecio L,2.0,not good pretentious
smith9298,3.5,"incredible cinematography, skarsgard was creepy but the character was more like a slow speaking old vamp.  other actors were good and the story was interesting, maybe worth watching at home though."
No Name,0.5,oh my lord this was the most boring movie i‚Äôve ever seen in my life
Fieldy,5.0,"good movie overall, same vibe as nosferatu 1922"
Joshua,5.0,"love me some good gothic horror, and this one takes the cake for being one of the greatest horror movies of the decade."
No Name,1.0,"way too long. did not earn its genre. more gross than scary and none of the relationships had depth. it was super flat. i wanted to like this so bad but it lacked.  1 star for the cool sets, makeup/costumes & the cats."
Andre,5.0,"if you love gothic horror and can handle mature adult themes, this is an experience of a lifetime! an absolute masterpiece. i never thought i would see something more iconic than dracula (1931). this is hands down one of the best works in the history of cinema. a round of applause to everyone involved in making this movie."
Arielle,2.5,i gave it a higher rating because of its originality along with the beautiful filmography but for me it was a super slow burn through the whole film and lacked the horror and excitement i was craving. recommend to watch at least once.
No Name,3.0,"truthfully, it was beautiful in terms of cinematic achievement. the script was similar to that of the original, by that, i mean the scenes and what occurred since the original was silent film. with that being said, it was slow and a bit boring. it was in no means scary as they rave it to be. it was a tad bit creepy and possibly disturbing. the acting was phenomenal, especially bill as orlok. his transformation was unbelievable. lily did a wonderful job as well even though people are making fun of her ‚Äúpossessed‚Äù style of acting where it just looks as if she is gyrating in the style of a seizure. if you want to watch it, go in to it knowing it has the writing style of an old victorian style film. it can be boring to those that don‚Äôt appreciate this style."
No Name,1.0,the scariest thing about that movie was how bad it was. if i could rate it a zero i would. i could have gone my whole life without seeing that movie
Vicente,5.0,"great movie. very gothic. bit of a stretch bringing in all the good vs. evil ethos to a reasonable understanding, but i eventually got it. warning, it's a period piece so one has to bear with the old english dialog, but it add reality to it. highly recommend the movie."
Bagel,5.0,"great storyline, amazing acting, overall 10/10 experience"
No Name,1.5,"o filme tinha um potencial exuberante mas segundo a avalia√ß√£o da minha equipe o filme se perde no meio do caminho se tornando entedioso e lento,fora as cenas nojentas entre o casal de vampiro e mulher linda,fiquei com d√≥ da loirinha,nota d√≥."
Deborah F,4.0,great cinematography and haunting music. gory with some jump scares.  kept my attention. best movie ive seen in quite awhile.
No Name,1.5,disappointing. i didn't get to see the ending because i got bored and decided to leave the theather early. something about it made it seem like an old movie but not in a good way.
Date night movie watcher,1.0,"slow to start, cinematography was way too dark, story was just boring with holes that didn't make sense. it was really terrible. we would have walked out but we had dinner reservations we needed to wait for so we stayed to see if it got better. sadly, it didn't.  the only bright spot was willem dafoe who was kind of a comic relief which was off but slightly entertaining."
No Name,5.0,"indredible settings and sound design make for a truly unsettling, haunted experience."
No Name,1.0,not what i thought it would be. sound visuals and performance was good but there was something missing that turned this movie into one of the most boring movies i have watched in a while
Kim,5.0,it was great all around!  very suspenseful!
No Name,4.5,"robert eggers, tomo el cargo de un proyecto con mucha responsabilidad cinematogr√°fica, de un proyecto cl√°sico y de una adaptaci√≥n de la novela ""dracula"". lo hizo muy bien y me quedo satisfecho con esta experiencia ""nosferatu""."
Ronnie C,2.5,stylish but too long and drawn out
Aaron,5.0,an absolute masterpiece!
Jonathan,5.0,brilliant adaptation of bram stokers classic. artistically filmed with stellar performances. one of the best movies all year. also i believe this to be skarsgards best performance.
No Name,5.0,just a great film all the way around. great acting and directing. classic story.
paul m,4.0,"great drama - not as scary or jump-scary as i thought it might be. a very good, dark, drama."
Zinnia G,2.5,i didnt care for all gore. some of the details were not necessary.
Jaz,0.5,"i did not like this movie at all, neither did my best friend, nor did the woman we met in the bathroom on the way out of the theatre - who said she was also disappointed by the movie. i got a very different idea of what this movie was going to be like before watching it, i thought it would be more of a dark romantic dry comedy with some gore. but it was literally disgusting and offensive to watch, i could not recommend it any less to anyone who has a common decency and nature. so disturbing. to some points, the acting was great (almost too great) and the way they actually filmed the movie was impressive and thoughtful within the scenes. the plotline and the execution of it left much to be desired. the costumes and dialogue was fantastic, but some of the only redeeming qualities of the film."
Christen J,1.0,"boring, had very little story line, one of us fell asleep"
Kelsey,1.0,horrible!!! i‚Äôd give it negative stars if i could!
Facebook U,2.5,movie fell flat. overacted and cheesy dialogue.
No Name,1.5,"i was looking forward to this and wanted to like it, but as i was watching i kept wondering when it would be done. there were parts that felt like a bad acid trip. the story felt disjointed. the scenery, sets, and costumes were lovely. it really did feel like a movie from the 1930s. the character of ellen was grating and unsympathetic. the movie as a whole was too long and all i felt was relief when it was finally over."
Sandee,2.0,"movie was to long, to many story lines and nosferatu was hard to understand at times. his actual storyline was confusing until the end and the best part was the last scene of the movie."
Maeghan,1.0,worst piece of hot garbage ive ever watched
No Name,2.5,"the new release of nosferatu seems a bit dark.  i was looking forward to watching this new release, but,  i prefer the 1979  movie, nosferatu the vampyre directed by werner herzog"
No Name,4.5,"this film was amazing to watch, i really don't knew it would be so fantastic, bill skarsg√•rd did an amazing role as count orlok, i definitely could see this film once more."
No Name,2.0,"i really enjoyed the cinematography and the historical setting, but the storyline was too slow and boring for me."
Emily B,3.0,"it's beautifully filmed with lots of stark imagery. unfortunately,  it felt muddled through the middle with some really slow parts."
Rhonda K,3.0,"picture was too dark, couldn‚Äôt see what was happening half the time."
No Name,0.5,felt about as scary as a 1920s horror movie with stupid shadows moving across the screen. also unnecessarily grotesque. we left the theater wishing we could have that time back.
No Name,0.5,"the theming and set time and place is beautiful and takes your breath away. sadly, while there were such well accomplished names in this movie, it was a let down. too much unneeded nude scenes, that did not contribute to the point of the scene, but to shock the viewer. storyline, was slow in developing, and even though there were moments that lit up the movie, they were quickly diminished but the slow plot. dafoe did lighten up the movie at multiple points, but there is just soo much he could do. the thing that did annoy me, was the scandinavian accent of count orlok, no wonder though, but still, it felt out of place, even if it was haunting to hear."
No Name,3.5,"this movie is all about atmospheric vibes, which i loved. story was slow and methodical, but i was interested throughout. ending felt a little abrupt."
No Name,4.5,"me tom√≥ mucho tiempo, tal vez desde the lighthouse, poder decir que una pel√≠cula de terror es la mejor experiencia del a√±o. nosferatu de robert eggers es m√°s de lo que esper√© y de lo que podr√≠a esperar del nuevo maestro del cine de terror. definitivamente, si bien no es perfecta, se acerca a lo mejor de su g√©nero."
Zoli,3.0,"the acting was largely stilted , the dailogue who-so.  i enjoyed the cinematography."
No Name,5.0,"visually compelling, outstanding score and very good acting!"
No Name,5.0,"this is easily one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time. i had seen it twice in theaters so far and just can't get over how amazing the scene transitions, acting and just general vibe of the movie. amazing."
No Name,1.0,would not recommended! i love vampire films but the voice was doing way too much. i found it very distracting and couldn‚Äôt take the film seriously at all because of it. the cinematography was very good but that‚Äôs about it tbh‚Ä¶.  had so much potential. did not meet it
No Name,1.5,"the visuals are great, and the actors‚Äô talent speak for itself, however the plot of the story ruins the whole experience. putting aside the flaws in the storyline, if one wanted to write about this horror movie in a magazine, the title for it would be - nosferatu, lustful vampire rages in germany."
No Name,3.0,same old storyline and hammy. a few jump scares
Ann O,0.5,"horrible, horrible horrible"
Pimpollo,5.0,"great sound, visuals, performances, costumes. mostly empty theater."
customer,0.5,"i thought the movie was boring, too loud with the music, and too much nudity and too mucg graphic sex scenes in it. wasn't what i thought it was going to be."
Joe,3.0,the setting for the movie was amazing but there was something missing about it. all the actors had great performances but the substance of the plot had a lot to be desired. bram stoker's dracula 1993 2.0.
Devante,0.5,dreadfully lack luster storyline! i had never walked out on a movie before walking out of this one.
No Name,1.0,"this flick was so boring we walked out before it was over. repetitive, unnecessarily gross, seemed to lean on special effects. dull, don't bother."
Dave,4.0,"enjoyed the classic horror and suspense.  it was not gory, but the effects and makeup were astounding.  the wardrobe was beautifully done and i normally don't care about that.  the actors were uterly convincing.  i would have rated it higher but in a nearly empty cinema a guy came in late fell asleep and snored.  had to wake him up several times."
No Name,4.5,"compared to the 1922 and 1979 versions, eggers' version of nosferatu is scarier and sexier. arguably the best portrayal of nosferatu as an undead beast, filled with beautiful yet grim shots that linger throughout the entire film."
Joshua L,4.0,"thought provoking film making . i have it 4 stars as its not a film i can invite everyone to see necessarily . i love how gothic and dark the mood is . the primal /sexual tension and expression of emotions is powerful in this film . i neve watched the original nosferatu , so i was pleased with this films take on the vampires strengths and weaknesses ."
Kristopher F,0.5,"awful! so, so boring!"
Shandi  C,5.0,"a beautiful slow burn, dread from beginning to end."
No Name,1.0,"sorry, i simply cannot comprehend all the positive reviews and a tomato rating of 85%?!!!  try to imagine a film worse than nosferatu.  spoiler alert:  you can‚Äôt!  this is one of the most poorly written, cliche-laden films i have ever seen. it also features several hilarious way over the top performances where actors appear to fake eye rolling seizures *so*ludicrously hammy that people in the audience erupted in laughter several times  (one person even threw paper at the screen!).  the dialogue seems like it was written by 9th - 11th graders with gems like ""a force worse than evil!"" ""you're a villain"" and tons of manic, panicked characters running around literally jumping ""to and fro"" yelling ""he's coming! he's coming!""  truly one of the slowest-moving, most dull plodding films i have ever seen. one can't help but feel bad for the actors.   this film adds nothing new to the canon (other than a vampire that looks vaguely like a carpathian version of ‚Äúfrank zappa‚Äù.)  save your money and see any one of the countless better versions of this same story, which most adults have probably already seen at least 7 times. oh...and it just kind of ""ends""! (not that you‚Äôre even paying attention at the end, but just sayin')  you‚Äôll laugh out loud, but sadly, this is not a comedy."
No Name,4.0,"it's a classic horror film set in the 18th century.   hats off to robert eggers and the crew; they did a marvellous job with the production.   while the film runs for a little over two hours, which is quite long, a 1 hour 30 minute film would have been more enjoyable.  i highly recommend horror fans watch it on the big screen."
No Name,5.0,"this was almost or is a masterpiece. the acting, lighting everything was done soooo well! minus the time traveling/instant transmission i habe no complaints. i wanna watch this again to relive the amazing acting! this is a must watch!"
No Name,5.0,"the type of movie you enjoy if you appreciate victorian era horror, detailed research of historical accuracy, theatrical acting, and thematic horror rather than jump scares. a wonderful adaptation of the classic vampire story taking the creature back to its folklore roots. robert eggers creates yet another horror masterpiece. if you write a review about bram stokers dracula from francis ford coppola being better than this while citing bad acting as the reason, you need to rewatch and pay closer attention to keanu reeves. every performance in this movie is better than his performance in that movie and i‚Äôm a reeves fan!"
Brandon E,4.0,"despite a long runtime and some pacing issues, nosferatu is a rich, rewarding horror movie that honors the original film and builds upon that foundation. as expected, eggers builds an immersive experience for us, and i was impressed by the set design, costume design, and atmosphere throughout the movie. the cast was wonderful and there are some genuinely horrifying moments that were jarring and sudden which was an aspect i really loved about the witch. skarsg√•rd and dafoe were both brilliant. recommended"
Brian L,1.0,"the storyline was slow, plodding , and poor.  i thought for the level of actors that they had the acting was actually very deliberate, unimaginative, and inadequate. this is the first movie in over decades of movie watching that i have ever walked out on."
No Name,2.0,"as soon as i found out about the release of this film, i was expecting something better. overall, the film is not bad, but i would not recommend watching it and would rather recommend the 1922 film. what i didn't like:  1. there are a lot of sex scenes and naked bodies, which in general are not needed for this film, i can only single out the scene at the end as a ‚Äúritual‚Äù, but basically this is not needed for the film.2. not really a minus, but something that i personally don‚Äôt like, it‚Äôs like i watched a big theater show, there‚Äôs no feeling of being in a movie, the actors played well, but it‚Äôs a theater and not a movie3. there are scenes that are worse than in the 1922 film. perhaps you may consider me wrong in terms of the fact that i compare the original film and this one, but it‚Äôs worth looking at it from the other side, why do i think the 1922 film is better? it's worth thinking about. i won't say specific scenes because it will be too long, but they are there.  finally, i want to say that this film upset me, i wanted to watch a terrifying film that conveys the spirit of nosferatu, but i watched something else, it could have been better."
No Name,3.0,"the visuals and acting were great, but the plot was so similar to dracula without being dracula it made it feel predictable, and you didn't really feel like these characters were real people save for the one guy you're apparently supposed to dislike, because the story doesn't flesh them out beyond their architype"
MICHAEL H,1.0,overacting.  sex scenes were unnecessary and in bad taste.  i had hoped for a classic horror story.  instead of scary it was laughable.  a great cast and  filmed well but poorly executed.  what a shame.
No Name,1.5,the only thing worse than the story was the atrocious acting! giving it one star for the sheer comedic painfulness.
Bill,4.0,"great movie, slow at times."
No Name,1.0,overhyped - what a wast of time.‚Ä®it looks amazing but that‚Äôs it.¬†‚Ä®confused screenwriting and wooden dialogue performed by constantly trembling actors.
No Name,1.0,cinematography and costumes were great but it‚Äôs one of the worst movies i‚Äôve ever seen. sloppy and meandering.
Ron,2.5,"overall a cool vampire story following the footsteps of the original but it was a bit boring, slow and corny at times. the voice of count orloc was distracting and hard to understand at times."
No Name,1.0,"slow and very boring. upset i watched the whole film and didn't leave halfway through  cinematography and acting by some of the main cast was good, but not enough to make this a worthwhile watch."
Thomas,2.0,decent remake of the old silent movie. might be worth waiting to watch it on tv.
No Name,0.5,the movie was boring
No Name,4.0,"classic horror film. period piece. great sets, acting, and special effects.   a bit long, over 2 hours. could have pulled out 15 to 30 minutes and not missed a beat.  that being said i really enjoyed the movie, and interesting mix of an old classic with modern gore. nosferatu may have raised the bar on dracula movies to a new height.  a must see for horror fans."
No Name,1.5,didn‚Äôt live up to expectations.  too many disjointed parts. the beast was a nasty piece. needed more than just a nasty beast though. the heroine was very good. very disappointing.
mindy d,3.5,great movie!!!!just kinda long
No Name,2.0,"was one of the few movies i felt like leaving the cinema   1st hour was so slow, everything happened in the last 30 minutes   was nothing that we‚Äôve not seen before when lee played dracula"
ammar S,5.0,very eeri feel to this film with some phenomenal acting as well as cinematography.
No Name,2.0,"excellent cinematography and solid performances from most of the actors. unfortunately not an original take on an old tale and there was a lack of depth to the whole thing,. i think i would have enjoyed it nore if it were less long, but an hour in i found myself bored and looking at my watch."
Ryan Garrison,2.0,way too long. and is missing the best parts of the bram stokers novel.
No Name,3.5,"the visuals were stunning. the sound effects kept you at the edge of your seat. orlock's breathing, the way he spoke, the poetic dialogue set the mood perfectly.  the ending however wasn't my favorite. just because i don't find it believable that orlock could be so dumb after having been a vampire so long."
Montie B,2.0,very few redeeming qualities other than the cast was great but the movie failed to live up to bram stokers dracula although it most likely was never intended to.  it loosely follows bram stokers dracula and once you watch it about the only thing you come away with is understanding why the original was banned for copyright infringement.  the story was similar but the names were changed to protect those guilty of a bad knockoff.
Wyatt,4.0,"amazing cinematography and shots, a great story, loved how the characters spoke like they were in the 1800s. loved the sets, nosferatu was great, dafoe was great, superb acting all around. leaves a little to be desired but still is overall a breath of fresh air and terrific"
No Name,5.0,"an instant classic. disturbing, scary, intriguing and a pure cinema experience! bravo!"
Lalo Preciado,4.0,it was ok. could use more explanation
teri,4.5,i know the way it was shot. in the storyline was the same but better and it kept you feeling like you were at a vampire movie. well done.
Steven G,1.0,very confusing movie. i didn‚Äôt know what was going on in the movie.
No Name,1.5,the first 45mins of the movie had me invested. lily depps 70th seizure had me check out early. anticlimactic ending and super awkward and forced sex scenes. the entire theatre giggled everytime ellen started convulsing. wait for it to hit netflix dont waste your money.
No Name,0.5,the film is a bad remake of dracula. if u know the drac story: u will see it here again. they only changed the names of the characters: but it's the exact same drac story step by tedious step.   i was planning on walking out before the middle of the movie: but i was invited...would have been rude.   i can't recommend it to no one knowing it's a knockoff of the original story.  the original 1922 film was really scary.   but this one: 5 thumbs down üëé
Lucas,5.0,"a very rare case nowadays where a movie genuinely gave me tingles for its eerie settings, vibe, and shots. also a very well acted and even vocal performances mainly by lilly-rose, nicholas, and bill."
Rhonda S,5.0,"this was a great movie! i loved the way it was filmed, the atmosphere and everything about it.  the music was also perfectly balanced to the mood of the movie."
No Name,5.0,"a lot of people might not like this movie because they are used to comic book movies with a lot of action and little thinking. but nosferatu is an amazing film that made me think for a few days about how well the film was shot, the great plot and acting. nosferatu's voice is legendary. i am going to see it again this week."
Galilea,4.0,acting was great but predictable.
No Name,5.0,masterfully shot and stays true to the spirit of the source material that inspired it. i have seen some complaints that it is slow. but in truth this is not meant to be an edge of your seat horror thriller but in many ways it is more a gothic romance with horror elements. the pacing while probably somewhat jarring to some modern audiences is well within the theme of the original film and honors it while also adding its own unique elements. i expect this films stature to rise in the coming years.
babyness L,5.0,excellent! lily‚Äôs performance was amazing along with the rest of the cast. loved the ending but sad.
Josh,4.0,a little bland- but a true rendition of stolker‚Äôs original sorrow
No Name,5.0,"i'm always drawn to period pieces, knew it would be great from the trailers, and it didn't disappoint. very intense and scary but excellent all around. haven't seen the original since a cinema college course decades ago, will definitely have to re-watch that version too."
Max Bryant,3.0,"great looking visuals and each cast member was very good.. the movie was okay bordering good in many parts. the story was slow in spots and had several moments of me questioning how ""that"" could possibly of  happened.. if you are a fan of the original and even lugosi's dracula you should see it. then make your.own comparisons and opinions."
Patricia,5.0,id like movies to be physically lighter.  the dark makes it hard to aee
MotoRacer,4.0,this is one of those rare movies that doesn't quite fit into its genre.  it's not a horror movie...  it's a horror experience. not slasher scares but truly unsettling and unnerving.  hard to recommend but it is delightfully dreadful.
Jared D,4.5,the movie starts off slow but once it picks up it stays interesting. some scenes were just the right level of disturbing i needed to see. the acting was great too. it was well worth it to watch.
Lestat de Lioncourt,5.0,captures dracula exactly as he was envisioned!!!
Jorge A,0.5,i will never get 2hrs of my life back.
No Name,2.5,"com base no que eu vi ao decorrer do filme que eles n√£o conseguiram o suficiente para o terror da qual esse vampiro expressa no filme de 1928, mas concordo que foi elaborado e deu ar de esperan√ßa para o terror g√≥tico, n√£o √© ruim, mas deveria ser melhor com tamanho or√ßamento"
No Name,1.0,like a box of rocks.dumb!!!
No Name,2.5,went to the bathroom towards the end and did go back.
Chris,3.0,"very cinematic, but kind of slow."
brian g,2.0,"the story as ok, dialogue was troublesome, but the cinematic elements were beautiful"
Tim Reichard,0.5,"not really scary. nosferatu, the monster was goofy looking with a big mustache.  kind of made the whole thing look silly."
No Name,3.0,"convulsing, eye rolling, rats‚Ä¶ the pinnacle of originality"
Jeff L,3.0,"not half a scary as the original. too long and needed better editing.  movie never draws you in. some of the scenes needed better direction. not terrible, not great."
Eric,4.0,"the movies was great , could had a little bit more of action but the acting was on point."
Lolani F,4.5,"very much enjoyed it.  yes, it is a ‚Äúslow‚Äù start, but it made sense to me. the first act sets up just what count olag/nosferatu is capable of, and i felt a slowly growing sense of dread and intensity the whole film through. will definitely watch again once it‚Äôs out on disc."
No Name,2.5,"it is a movie that adds to the original movie from 1922. however, some points stands: 1.there are too many sexual scene and teases and does add little to nothing to the movie. 2.runtime can be shortened with so much unecessary scenes; people walking and transpiring? 3.motif? coherence? mad scientist? all of stereotypes of movies are present.  i expect better story telling after a 100 years. you should not just add more scenes and details, but also give meaning to them."
No Name,1.0,"absolute garbage!! i fell asleep, bad acting, bad story i even started laughing a few times. i can not understand the hype for this movie the original 1922 version was ten times better! what a waste of money!!"
Sukhmani  C,4.0,"gore, jump scares, very intriguing and a unique plot. so worth the watch, enjoy!!"
No Name,1.0,worst movie i have seen in a long time. extremely boring. nothing like dracula with wynona ryder! i tried to leave but my husband wanted to finish his beer.
Linda L,1.0,"its hard to know where to begin. the acting was terrible. the set decoration was messy and uninteresting. many of the scenes were centrally focused and uninteresting.  it was boring, plodding, and anemic. dont waste your time on this one."
JH,1.0,dreadful. simply dreadful
No Name,3.0,i was expecting more horror it want bad just not my tastes in horror movies
No Name,5.0,perhaps one of the greatest gothic horrors ever put to film.
Michelle,2.0,a remake that shouldnt have been remade
No Name,0.5,this movie left me exhausted. same visuals you‚Äôve seen before. a lot of unnecessary artsy shots and scenes. no character development. it‚Äôs just icky. i feel like things were put in for pure shock value. no substance. the acting was bumpy. i landed up leaving early.
David,1.0,very poor remake on bram stokers dracula. don't waste your money like i did.
Richard D,0.5,redundant. so dark you cant see anything. disjointed. terrible film
No Name,0.5,"nosferatu (2024) misses the mark by leaning heavily into shock value. both versions are great at world building and atmosphere but the poorly written script and outdated themes overwhelmed any positives.  movies or scenes that include sexual violence tropes that aren‚Äôt necessary, are boring at this point. it‚Äôs a tired, cliched tactic and this movie offers no new insight and relies far too much on trying to make the audience uncomfortable then making those scenes relevant.  the necrophilia scene, in my opinion, was a disgusting addition to the story. i understand vampires are the undead and there are many themes of sex and lust within vampire stories but anna wasn‚Äôt a vampire - she was just a dead woman. in the room with their two dead children. bleak.  you can‚Äôt give consent when you‚Äôre being threatened. it‚Äôs no longer consent at that point. so for everyone saying ellen consented at the end by saying the words ‚Äúi consent‚Äù - literally he was threatening to kill everyone in the town if she didn‚Äôt have sex with him and she decided to sacrifice herself (that doesn‚Äôt equal consent).  the film‚Äôs pacing drags, the tension never truly builds, and the result is a drawn-out experience doesn‚Äôt offer any new insight to an old, over-used trope."
No Name,0.5,"this movie was photographed well but it's boring, overlong and the editing is so disjointed that you'll lose interest. i've seen the other versions of nosferatu and they stand up well over time. you will note that most critics are raving about the cinematography, really ?  its dark for no real purpose. most movies based upon this theme are really like westerns, hero vs villain's, showdowns, carriage chases at midnight or sun up, innocent damsel in distress waiting for dudley do right ! even the old hammer films got it right!  coppola's dracula was one of the  best i ever saw and this movie isn't in the same ball park. frank langella's was the epitome of cool up to that point. save your money the advertisements are fake news ! :-)"
No Name,1.0,one star for the production value. the story is what matters most and without drawing from memories of earlier versions it does not hold up on its own. it has terrible writing and characters we don‚Äôt care about. it was actually stupid. it makes coppola‚Äôs look like even more of a masterpiece.
Stef,4.0,i liked dracula better.
Dennis L,5.0,loved it great shooting and atmosphere. dep was amazing olocks look was way different then i thought is would be
Cara,3.0,"i dozed off twice in this movie.  this movie was not for me.  maybe if i had more knowledge on the subject matter, i would have appreciated this film.  nosferatu was hard to understand and his asthmatic breathing was distracting and unnecessary.   save your money people!   wait until it's streaming online!"
Steve B,5.0,"this movie has an unsettling feeling throughout. its a fresh inspired by but not a copy of dracula.  great production design and makeup. it also has some very intense moments. just when you think the movie is moving a little slow something happens that makes you realize its not slow, its perfectly paced. the rats and what came with them (not spoiling) was a clever backdrop. as a seasoned movie goer its hard to scare me but this movie pulled it off, and its just creepy."
Dylan,3.5,incredible acting‚Ä¶ but wtf?
No Name,1.0,the weirdest and most genuinely disturbing movie that i have ever seen in theaters. wouldn‚Äôt recommend to my worst enemy.
No Name,1.5,i need therapy after watching this
Preston,2.0,"personally, did not like it.  the acting was weird.  maybe that‚Äôs what people were like in the 1800s but it seemed exaggerated.  the plot was weird (just a rotting corpse that drinks blood).  just not my cup of tea.  i‚Äôll stick to sexy vamps with cool powers."
John M,3.0,"good, but a little slow"
E F,4.0,"stunning visuals , costume and set design added both elegance and horror to the story."
No Name,1.0,i was hoping for a sexy vampire movie and this was not that! very cinematic odds all i can say that was positive. i cannot get the last three hours out of my mind quick enough!
PayPal U,2.0,confusing plot and story line. only one jump scare.
Scotty,5.0,"this is an epic masterpiece of gothic horror. as a horror movie buff, this is one of the greatest horror movies i've ever seen. the atmosphere is absolutely chilling,  the camera work is delicious, the acting superb, and the scares are real and consistent throughout. i saw it christmas evening and i couldn't wait to go see it again ....better than i expected it could be...."
Peter R,1.0,did not keep our attention at all.
No Name,0.5,"oof‚Ä¶ over acted, character motivation all over the place, and boring. very disappointing. one of the worst movies i‚Äôve seen."
No Name,1.0,it was really slow and melodramatic. if it‚Äôs aim was period nostalgia it hit if it‚Äôs aim was horror it failed badly‚Ä¶
Josie,3.0,perfect watch for a cold snowy afternoon but any other time mighthave felt more laborious.
George C,2.5,"the ending was very satisfying, but the process of getting there was very boring at times."
carl c,1.5,this movie didn‚Äôt have a plot. if it did it was a horrible one
No Name,0.5,"absolutely awful. probably one of the worst films i‚Äôve ever seen. plot was way too long, and hard to follow. movie was boring and i should have left half way through"
No Name,5.0,"as someone who has seen the original, grown up in germany, and has roots in the balkans, i deeply appreciate nosferatu. robert eggers has impressed me once again with his mastery of folklore horror, as well as his respect for and consideration of different cultures and languages across europe. the film stays true to the original, and i am truly grateful that they showed such great appreciation for this classic, rather than altering it to suit modern audiences simply for the sake of it. the actors all did an excellent job portraying their characters, and the scenes, backgrounds, and settings were absolutely stunning."
Scott W,5.0,best rendition of the dracula story ive ever seen. great setting the mood well acted and very entertaining.  not to be missed.
No Name,4.0,absolute must see. i have never seen the original and have been intrigued by the story. anyone thinking that this film is a horror it is not. it is much more.... now to watch the original!!!
Sheena,4.0,"suspenseful, great sets and body costumes."
No Name,5.0,"a beautiful, thought-provoking and scary interpretation of dracula/nosferatu."
Andrew C,4.0,"overall, i loved the tone that we come to expect with an eggers movie. while highly enjoyable, some scenes felt forced. but i love that it felt like an old and new film all at once. acting was impeccable by all those involved."
No Name,5.0,"for the fans of dark romance a must see movie, heartwarming and humoristic. the visuals are on the spot with the audio, tickling and exiting."
No Name,1.0,"walked out after 30 minutes. cross between a bad period drama and a mel brooks parody (which might have been a whole lot better). very dissapointed, only went to see it for bill skarsgard as it was so good."
No Name,5.0,"slow, long, but very haunting and brilliant!"
jtrincon U,2.0,it was a very strange and grotesque version of the original movie
No Name,3.5,"i had high expectations for this one, and was left a little disappointed.  great mood and dreamlike quality to the movie.   it just felt unnecessarily long in the theater, and unnecessary overall.  that's my main issue. was this take on nosferatu really necessary?  did it offer anything new?  my answer is no.  it's good, but nothing special.  i think the script needed a bit of work and more focus."
Andrew,5.0,bill skarsgard from pennywise to count orlok my goodness the talent in that human
No Name,0.5,vampire movie cliche + vampire movie cliche + vampire movie cliche ad nauseum: i tried hard not to laugh out loud so as not to spoil anyone else‚Äôs enjoyment. i was not always successful.
No Name,5.0,"it won‚Äôt be for everyone, if you expecting some teen horror movie with jump scares this movies isn‚Äôt for you. the acting is 10 out of 10 same it goes for the way they decided to film it. brings back memories of old movies but better adapted for today. at the end of its core it‚Äôs a dark romance"
No Name,2.5,"good acting, got the message, sometimes beautiful... but boring. halfway throught the movie i just wanted it to end and though some might find ""poetry"" in the ending, to me it was just ""meh""."
Sara M,1.0,the acting was horrendous. the pacing was slow. gore added for shock value that was completely out of place. i almost thought it was a parody. i should have walked out.
craig,4.5,"well done classic‚Ä¶. the mustache threw me, but otherwise a good watch‚Ä¶"
No Name,1.0,"clearly a disappointment, it was a poor version of bram stokers dracula.  sad that some actors signed up for this for just a paycheck."
C.W.,2.0,"the cinematography, sets, and acting were outstanding, making nosferatu worth seeing. however, the movie was hard to follow, and the gratuitous violence was gruesome and distracted from the story. we left the movie feeling disappointed in a film that should have been an excellent remake of a classic that, in our options, missed the mark."
No Name,5.0,"two hours of fan service to gothic horror, classic cinematography and vampire lore. if this is a genre you like, this movie covers all the bases. it even has perfect 1830s costumes. it conveys creeping dread through out the film. the actors also worked hard to create that atmosphere.  best vampire movie in 30 years in my opinion. must see film for gothic horror fans.   if you‚Äôre looking for a vampire romance or fast paced horror thriller, this is not that style.  probably not the movie for you."
Demerise,1.0,"it was awful. ended up leaving after an hour. slow plot, difficult to see the film was so dark"
Stephen V,4.0,"great style, strong acting, and a very refreshing approach to a very familiar story. definitely worth seeing on a big screen. the visuals are gorgeous"
No Name,2.0,"nosferatu was more interested in having sex than other thing, they principal characters never fight o even try to fight to the moster, i know that is a super power creature but really nothing ? it okey the movie for me is a 6/10."
No Name,4.0,"the story feels a bit thin, and the end underwhelming, but everything else is top notch. amazing cinematography, great acting, great direction. amazing atmosphere. just wish the story took bigger swings."
John,2.0,unfortunately left the theater feeling disappointed‚Ä¶
Gary,0.5,worst movie i have scene in over a decade. i actually left 1/2 way through it was so bad and i love science fiction.
No Name,4.5,robert eggers makes the case with nosferatu that he may be unrivaled when it comes to auteur horror. the film punctuates the tragedies of its familiar story with a nuanced layer of visceral horror that only eggers is capable of producing. ari aster may be the only other horror director who can come close.
Chloe,2.5,good for people who like older movies. it was a lot to understand and thats not my cuppa.
Louisa,0.5,watching the plot play out was as hard as listening to nails on chalkboard.
No Name,5.0,excellent! i don't miss any vampire or vampire-adjacent movies. i'm a vampire junkie. this one checks all the boxes. the hype you've been hearing is true. pay attention or you'll miss the origin of it all. one of the best movies i've seen.
Christopher David Baum,5.0,im romanian: the movie was (authentic) in every way to our culture and lore.
Julie T,5.0,excellent movie. i love the classic feeling of it.
No Name,1.0,awfully boring. vampire movies made 30 years ago were scarier and had better moments. this was a waste of time
No Name,3.0,takes a while to get going but when willem dafoe turns up it starts to cook
Color,5.0,phenomenal!!!! amazing cinematography
Marissa,3.5,"you know when a movie insists upon itself??? well, i didn‚Äôt until i watched this. it‚Äôs a great allegory for repressed sa trauma or trauma in general, but the run time could‚Äôve been halved and had the same impact. willem was the best part. ‚Äúthen rave she must!!!‚Äù"
No Name,5.0,words will immaculately fall short for this cinematic magnum opus of the entire horror genre!! i bow down to thee- mr. eggers. unparalleled horror era has begun!!
Matthew P,2.5,awesome visuals and acting but the story falls short.
David,3.0,"loved the style, artsy shots, costumes were stellar ! not sure about the execution though. i feel like finale just kind of happened."
Dr√©,5.0,3rd watch‚Ä¶ imax ‚Ä¶ lilacs everywhere!  the soul is sacred. the shadows will consume in the after hours of the night. admitting that evils do exist within us is the only way to put them at bay-  to be able to exist with them and not become lost because of them.   ‚Äúyou are my affliction.‚Äù - count orlok
No Name,5.0,bill skarsgard what an actor.
Caleb,3.0,"this movie succeeded in art direction, excelled in individual performances, but lacked a script that ventured to do anything interesting with its beautiful world and characters. remarkably safe but addled with the pieces of a truly inspired film."
russW121,4.0,"it was a beautiful peace of cinema and story telling, had me on the edge of my seat for a majority of the movie"
No Name,1.5,"the lighting and cinematography were undeniably stunning, with beautifully shot scenes that captured a gothic aesthetic. however, the movie itself fell flat for me. despite my love for gothic-style and horror films, this one was incredibly slow and boring. at times, my friend and i found ourselves laughing at moments that were clearly not intended to be humorous, they just came off as ridiculous. it wasn‚Äôt scary, the plot was riddled with holes, and many scenes felt unnecessary, as though they were added to just elongated the film. honestly, you could cut a significant portion of the movie, and it wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. i wouldn‚Äôt watch it again or recommend seeing it in theaters."
No Name,0.5,"i couldn't make it to the end, it was so awful. my friend and i were both laughing at the acting and the script. sure, it looks good which i expected from eggers but the count sounded like he had emphysema and ellen sounded like she was in a mill's and boon novel. very disappointing."
Kyle,4.5,its a masterpiece. its filmed beautifully in every shot. the acting is phenomenal and the story was so well written. it was the perfect re imagining of the original.
Jackie G,5.0,"if you like the classics, this is a must see! cinematography is awesome. great costuming, relentless tension."
No Name,1.0,this movie was absolutely terrible. if i had one to describe this movie it would be ‚Äúeww‚Äù. i had high hopes for this movie considering the reviews rated it high but i think it‚Äôs only appealing to certain people who are there to enjoy the film-making and cinema behind it but it is not good if you are looking for a good scare. the whole time i watched it i just cringed.
No Name,1.0,muito chato! n√£o mant√©m nossa aten√ß√£o at√© o fim... roteiro ruim...
No Name,0.5,"i think this is the second worst movie i've ever seen - better than human centipede 2, and slightly worse than the original.   the plot was boring and you have to try and figure out what's happening. the pace was very slow, and the visuals were way too dark. the characters weren't very developed, which is even worse when so much time is wasted."
No Name,0.5,the main actress did a subpar acting job. they made dracula look like it was the corpse of joseph stalin it was a huge let down not scary at all and laughable if you want to watch a nosferatu then watch the 1922 version it is actually gives you the chills and nightmares and all this done with no sound the 1922 version is not a talkie that version would get five stars this version if i could give it a quarter i would!
No Name,5.0,spunchbob squarepant
CTUAIR,5.0,excellent new take on dracula. not just a repeat of the same old story.
gelviz,5.0,great movie!!! 10/10 the whole cast did a phenomenal job and a amazing story
jason m,5.0,just really well done. beautiful movie.
Patricia,2.0,"boring... drawn out. very old fashioned vampire style directing... they should have indicated in their previews that their movie would be that style. me and the stranger next to me both fell asleep halfway through the movie... otherwise, spectacular acting from everyone"
Lisa P,1.0,"this movie was quite possibly one of the worst movies i‚Äôve ever seen. the movie itself was really dark and you can barely see what‚Äôs going on. the vampire spoke so slowly that i forgot what he started to say. it was so awful that we left 45 minutes into it‚Ä¶would have left earlier but i wanted to finish my $15 beer! i can‚Äôt believe critics called this brilliant! it was anything, but!"
xDivineChaosx,5.0,a classic. beautifully shot and attention to detail was superb.
No Name,1.0,"this movie seemed to the start to be very promising with the period german town but it really just feels like a flat line..nothing interesting happens, not scary not exciting and the scenery in the mountains looked like western canada not eastern europe. almost fell asleep 5 times..waste of a friday night out."
No Name,4.0,a little long for me but otherwise good acting and overall a good movie
No Name,0.5,the characters kept going into pound town literally in every scene.  if you are an icebreaker fan youll like this movie with the freaky characters
No Name,2.5,"the story was good, but the characters were not developed properly  needed to be more of a love story  touched all the bases  amazing set design and costumes, etc.  from a production standpoint, it is outstanding"
Jani Na a was,4.0,great cinematography!
No Name,2.5,i loved the cinematography of the film but nosferatu is let down by being far too hammy and by playing it's plot cards far too early. the film lacks an emotional core and despite it's feminine credentials ultimately wants to have it's proverbial neck and eat it. disappointing but it does look great.
NP,5.0,"absolutely amazing. the acting, the set design, the costume design, the story. one of the best films i‚Äôve ever seen."
michael lyons,5.0,a great reimagining and addition to the nosferatu films. not recommended for people who like their vampires suave and well groomed.
No Name,2.5,"its too bad that bill skarsgard looks like a zombie doc holiday from a spaghetti western with that stupid mustache.it would also have been nice to not have to wait till half way through the movie to actually see him come out of such darkly lit scenes . gary oldman , and tom waits you remain the standard for me . a dracula movie without dracula is  ... fangless  ."
Rachel,0.5,not good as horror or any other genre. so slow. boring.
No Name,0.5,"this is the worst movie ive seen in a long long time. it‚Äôs slow, it doesnt make sense, it‚Äôs not scary. not good."
JOSEPH,3.5,"good cinematography, costuming and acting. primary female character at times very difficult to understand her lines. not really scary. seemed a bit too long."
No Name,4.0,"robert eggers is the real star here, such a creative unique and amazing director. making films like this in 2025, love it. not as confusing or as good as the lighthouse but better than his other movies, abit slow at times but the horror elements where so good, orlok himself looked amazing and sounded even better and was brilliantly sinister, the whole cast where really good and of course the film had some spectacular shots."
Matthew J,2.5,"average at best.  there‚Äôs not much new in this version that‚Äôs closer to being a failed remake attempt at bram strokers dracula, which is far superior."
No Name,5.0,"great and disturbing movie, not for everyone! i enjoyed its style, every picture of it  can be printed as a wall poster."
No Name,0.5,"this is hands down the most cringe movie i've ever seen. it's as if someone took a room full of schizophrenic perverts and told them to make a vampire movie based on nosferatu. if you're looking a for a real horror movie, go with alien: romulus."
No Name,0.5,waste of time and money!
Matt,3.0,"good film, just an okay movie. not worth going to the theaters for"
Mikel,4.5,liked it the first time. loved it the second. this is the level of quality and attention to detail movies need these days.
No Name,2.0,"movie very slow, and boring on my opinion"
Meccassault,3.0,"the cinematography, acting, and film score are all solid. the pace of the film was a bit drawn out in almost every scene, which sometimes works to its advantage and, at other times, not at all. it's worth a once over, especially if you prefer legitimate vampire films. but, more could've happened throughout with a better pace. it's definitely not a ""scary"" film, so if you go in expecting that, you'll be disappointed. there are, however, a few very intense moments i liked."
No Name,1.0,"sorry, but this emporer has no clothes. this is a long, ponderous, overly self important and boring film. if not with friends i would have walked. yes it is well done, and has lovely production values and homage to the original blah blah.   but there is nothing frightening, the characters are bland and wholly predictable, it needs a proper edit as it is way too long, and i was just wanting the vampire to get it over with and kill everyone so i could go home. there is no suspense.   interesting themes such as the nature of evil and the intersection of sexuality and sin are squandered by heavy handed acting and direction.   our audience laughed out loud at scenes that were clearly not meant to be comedic, it was all so heavy handed.   not to mention the practical plot holes big enough by to drive a hearse through.   will get oscar for best acting by pigeons and rats......  good luck with it. go in with low expectations and you will have a passable time. go in believing the critics and you will be disappointed."
Jose Arrocha,5.0,great movie. fantastic visuals and performances. dafoe stands out just as much as skarsgard‚Äôs title character. hoult continues to be a brilliant risk taker. able to blend his talents into the different tones of a genre like in this and renfield. some of the best use of a vampires abilities and limitations in cinematic history are displayed.
Enrique Ramirez,5.0,arte  en esta pel√≠cula he regresado a ver por qu√© el cine es arte.
Tammy,1.0,very slow. was falling asleep
No Name,0.5,"boooooring as hell......the story is rubbish outer locations of castle look like a cardboard cutout,the movie is so bad any sort of acting can't save it, all those positive reviews and appreciation were a big scam....my head started hurting in between.... it's a terrible film."
MARCI K,1.0,"gory, bloody, disgusting display of a vampire.  i have seen many dracula and vampire movies that were entertaining however, this one was over the top with gross!  could not even watch most of the disturbing killing scenes.  omg."
No Name,2.0,"6 of 10  beautifuly made movie, just not exciting nor interesting. orlok's body looked cgi & out of place in many scenes.   seems to be eggers thing, to wow everybody via eye candy but forget to entertain ?! lot of plot cohesion was lost due to drawn out cinematography for visuals, could've been 40 minutes shorter. this is a gothic/art house romance not horror imo."
mike d,4.0,"gorgeous looking movie while being terrifying as well.  the pacing feels very off though, so i hope the extended version helps that"
No Name,5.0,"i went into this with low expectations. it had been out for two and a half weeks and i could see on social media it was getting very mixed reviews.  some people hated it. some people loved it but not too many saying it was so-so. i loved it. i knew that it wasn't going to be a friday the 13th. kind of scary. my fear was that it was going to pay so much homage to the original that it was going to feel like an art piece. which it is, but it's also very entertaining. no cheap scares but plenty of creep. every actor did an excellent job. great movie making."
Taylor,0.5,overly sexualized- storyline very predictable because they narrated everything before it happened
No Name,3.0,i expected more horror.
Dan,4.0,nosferatu? more like nice for-a you! to watch!
No Name,3.0,"starts off quite well, but gets kinda dull and there's a some cringe moments."
Shara,2.0,we thought it was very dark.
No Name,2.0,"beautifully shot/edited, good acting too for the most part, but the plot moved too slowly, there was not enough emotional connections to the characters that die/get killed which contributed to a low-stakes/easy-mode storyline."
Karen B,5.0,"classic for years to come., and a masterpiece of horror"
No Name,1.0,waste of money went to see it based on the 85% on rotten tomatoes  was slow and not worth my time
Ryan  R,5.0,a very spooky remake of an on old silent film.
No Name,0.5,"calling it borderline unwatchable is too good for this movie. i'd rewatch nicholas cage's worst movie on repeat than suffer through this cinematic garbage. astounding the amount of money thrown at these people writing good reviews for this visual hot garbage. dracula (1931) has better writing and plot points. the entire theater laughed several times at what was meant to be dramatic and severe moments, atleast for those who didn't walk out."
No Name,0.5,don‚Äôt believe any of the crap reviews about this movie. i‚Äôm an insomniac and this movie was so bad it put me to sleep multiple times. this movie is one of the worst movies i‚Äôve seen in 48 years. it was the third worst movie i‚Äôve ever seen in a theater. it should get negative stars.
Cars,4.0,superb acting and defining visuals. hated the mustache.
Steven S,3.0,"great atmosphere, costumes and setting and general mood of the period a little plodding and not scary at all. i also wish demon boy didnt talk so much."
No Name,5.0,"beautiful scenes, solid cast, nice storytelling."
Eric L,0.5,awful. i would give a negative star if possible. tedious and made me wish i were watching bela lugosi.
William H,5.0,a incredibly great movie. bill skarsgrd was phenomenal and willem dafoe killed it. robert eggers is great director!
Gabe,3.5,"solid movie, interesting story. terrible audio and screen quality at the theater."
Robert,4.0,"decent movie. not exactly a horror movie in the traditional sense, but definitely has some creepy moments with great atmosphere."
No Name,5.0,"best movie in years, absolutely impeccable"
No Name,3.0,"a very impressive remake much in the style of eggers' other works. a obscure and dense atmosphere; impactful i would say, just like the monster. a very good, dark cinematography"
Louis,3.0,"good, but sort of hard to follow in the beginning (slow beginning mind u), very interesting performances, great lure, great visuals, copies the exorcist a little, but in a good way. overall, 6.75/10"
No Name,2.0,"visually beautiful, but ultimately boring. how do you make a horror movie in 2025 (well, released in 2025) and have people feeling the original made one hundred years ago is scarier?  it plodded along, and i wanted to fall asleep (i love horror movies, and i love many ‚Äúslow‚Äù movies). i saw another review that praised the cinematography, saying every shot was made with such care. and actually that‚Äôs kind of the problem. every single frickin thing was apparently filmed to be a piece of art. overwrought! overdone! just get on with the story! and oh my gosh, the length of this movie‚Ä¶.an hour too long.  and the mustache was stupid and distracting. the people involved in this were a little too high on their own vapors."
No Name,0.5,almost walked out a few times
No Name,3.5,"this movie is an engaging experience, even if it doesn‚Äôt tread entirely new ground narratively. robert eggers‚Äô signature style is evident in the poetic interplay of cinematography, set design, and composition. the visual storytelling often speaks louder than the script, capturing a mood that lingers. the actors deliver strong performances, but the film‚Äôs true star is its meticulous framing‚Äîfrequent off-center subjects set against intricate, atmospheric backdrops tell a story all their own."
No Name,0.5,"i don't understand the positive reviews. did you actually watch the same film? it's absolute garbage. terrible pacing and acting, boring and drab. borderline unwatchable at times. it feels like the reviews are paid for! ""best dracula movie ever' i find these views exaggerated. watch this film and you'll feel the same."
No Name,0.5,hate it so much it was boring
SandNerd,1.5,disgusted? 100%. scared? 0. atmosphere? 100%. narrative? 0.
No Name,0.5,"this was soooo baddd!!! movie was super slow paced. almost fell asleep. the visuals were terrible. the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù scene were sooo hilarious, i couldn‚Äôt take it seriously. count orlok sucking people off on the cest and dey humping them while doing so was the stupidest thing ive seen. the movie isnt even coherent. the ending was so bad, like, they did nothing! absolutely nothing. the whole arc and story was meaningless! dont waste your money on this. just rewatch bram strokers dracula instead."
Carlisha.C,5.0,love the classic dark gothic horror feel! the actors are superb!
Wigan shopper,4.0,great cinematography and well acted. willem dafoe plays it camp throughout. story tracks with tradition and the a few dekes. seemed a little long in part but overall a very good rendition.
No Name,3.0,"there‚Äôs much to admire in this movie, especially how it looks and sounds, but there‚Äôs not much to love."
Rick Thunderblood,5.0,"best dracula movie, hands down!"
No Name,2.5,"it looks great, incredibly atmospheric.   there are some good points: the cast, the soundtrack and sound design, the art direction, set design, costume design are all great. in terms of gothic vibes and cinematography, it is the most beautiful film i‚Äôve seen.  however: it‚Äôs not scary, the story isn‚Äôt particularly interesting, and nosferatu the vampire talks came across as silly. certain elements became a little tedious."
Rebecca,5.0,scary as heck. stuck close to book in the first half which was cool. last 15 minutes are crazy!
No Name,0.5,"nosferatu is an absolute disgrace to the horror genre. it doesn‚Äôt even hold a candle to the chilling original‚Äîit‚Äôs just plain gross. and not in the way you might expect from a horror film, where tension or gore create a sense of unease; no, this film‚Äôs vulgarity overwhelms everything that could have made it redeemable. while the costume and set are remarkable, the movie itself feels less like a terrifying exploration of the supernatural and more like a poorly executed, borderline soft-core porno. the atmosphere, instead of invoking dread or suspense, drips with uncomfortable and unrelenting crassness. if you were hoping for a compelling vampire tale, you're in the wrong place. nosferatu isn‚Äôt just a disappointment‚Äîit's a grotesque spectacle that seems more intent on being a soft-core porno, than providing any genuine horror."
Alucard,5.0,a nice nod to the past with a subtle touch to effects so the mind does the heavy lifting.
No Name,1.5,it‚Äôs a horror movie but at no point did i feel scared or feel any tangible threat. it was like an action movie. made no sense. it was in english but characters were vocalised as frau or herr. the pace was concertinaed. great photography and sound but the script and direction was awful tbh. the 1922 version is so much better. pointless film in my humble opinion. so many other versions of dracula have been done so well.
No Name,4.0,"a twisted tale like no other - nosferatu delves deep into ideas of true psychosis, pain, and love. all whilst having a sick and horrific villain with his ambition set on his one true prize."
trequan,0.5,boring bad bad bad don't go
Daron,4.0,"i loved to sets and, the environment of the movie."
Susan,5.0,"absolutely the best dracula movie ever.  it was scary. the clothing for the time period was authentic and beautiful. dracula didnt change from ugly to gorgeous, he stayed  horrible. highly recommend."
No Name,5.0,"a masterpiece, best vampire movie of all time, it brings a fresh perspective to the classic dracula tale, a female perspective and her deepest and darkest desires"
No Name,3.0,"beautifully shot and eerie throughout, but i left feeling like i've seen this before (for obvious reasons). nothing new really happens, the ""heroes"" don't really do anything meaningful, orlocs voice gets annoying and all this lasts for over 2hrs."
No Name,1.0,"i went to this movie with great expectations as i love horror films and vampire genres.  sadly, i was greatly disappointed.  it was nothing more than a love story with a less than thrilling finish. i don't often feel like i could sleep when i go to the movies, but i have to admit that i came close to nodding off - twice."
Cory M,5.0,amazing cinematography. every shot was composed with care!
No Name,3.0,"this particular movie was a snooze fest. very slow and drawn out. the visuals were great and it had great music scores, but it lacked in entertainment."
No Name,1.0,"not a good story. it is obscene, and the character's solution to combat evil is to engage in an immoral act instead of exercising uncompromisable virtues."
No Name,2.0,both fell asleep wanted to watch till the end but was very slow ended up leaving cinema and we never do that
No Name,5.0,the most beautiful movie i've seen in the last year.
No Name,4.5,"the first half of this movie is a bit slow. the last third of the movie kicked it really into gear. the allegories to sexual assault, the character's deceptions of each other, and the finale sequence are so well acted.  the movie had amazing cinematography that really did a good job of creating an eerie atmosphere.  orlock was very creepy and i loved the focus on how he is almost a personification of dark sexuality.  the character growth for the main characters was a great journey."
No Name,1.0,"it's bad. watched with a friend and i felt uncomfortable and not in a normal horror way this felt like porn at some points, the cinematography was good but it's a nock off dracula with a crap plot and mid characters"
Victoria,2.0,very slow. a lot of friends told me they fell asleep.
No Name,4.0,"the expectations were higher than what was delivered, but it is a good film. truth is, bram stocker's dracula is better still. i guess it's impossible to top garry oldman as count dracula"
No Name,5.0,"germany, 1838. an estate agent has to travel to transylvania to deliver a contract to a wealthy count living in a castle in the carpathian mountains. the mysterious old man intends to relocate to the same hometown where the young man lives with the love of his life, a troubled woman suffering from a supernatural possession. upon his arrival, the creature covers the town with complete darkness and disease, revealing a voracious appetite for fresh blood. ""nosferatu"" is a masterful ghotic tale in command of the major elements in horror: an exceptionally unsettling atmosphere, a terrifying monster, and stunning visuals. the movie exceeds the expectations in ressurecting the most iconic vampire in cinema, a remarkable achievement considering the inevitability of comparing this production with the original from 1922. an outstanding addition to the horror hall of fame!"
Neyland,3.0,passed the time. was a unique and good story but the movie didn‚Äôt feel scary or suspenseful. felt like i was watching a drama with jim carrey from sonic as the bad guy. wasn‚Äôt scary.
No Name,5.0,"robert eggers' nosferatu is an arresting reimagining of f.w. murnau‚Äôs 1922 masterpiece, blending gothic horror with eggers' meticulous commitment to historical authenticity and atmosphere. the film is a triumph of art direction, with every frame meticulously composed to evoke the haunting beauty and existential dread of its source material. from the claustrophobic cobblestone streets to the eerie glow of moonlit castles, eggers' world feels alive, pulsating with both menace and melancholic beauty.  eggers has crafted what can only be described as the definitive vampire film of the 21st century, transcending genre conventions to explore deeper themes of desire, corruption, and the eternal battle between light and darkness. the film's atmosphere is oppressive yet captivating, weaving a spell that lingers long after the credits roll. in a landscape dominated by disposable genre fare, nosferatu stands as a testament to the enduring power of cinema to reawaken the myths that haunt us, delivering not just a film, but a macabre symphony of shadow and light that cements its place as a modern classic."
Rodney B,3.5,"'nosferatu' is a horror movie that is equal parts creepy, gory, disturbing and frightening.  it is beautifully shot and directed but for me falls short of being great because i didn't connect or relate to any of the characters.  that may be by design but it left me with a hollow feeling.   like a meal that looks better than it tastes."
No Name,4.5,one of my all time favorite vampire type movies.
No Name,5.0,"nature versus nurture, robert eggers' nosferatu fills like a wide shadow cast upon man, hopelessly lived in, and the sound design throughout takes that immersion even further. eggers' craft only expands with each entry of his."
No Name,1.5,"dull, leaden film that loses all the subtle psychological nuances of earlier versions.  i fell asleep.  a real snorer."
No Name,1.0,"wow. this was a huge disappointment. i found my self laughing more than feeling any sense of dread or fear. cheap and pointless jump scares too. loved the directors previous movies, but this was pretty boring and a let down. oh and the orlock design is ridiculous."
Jake,3.0,"nosferatu is undeniably impressive from a production standpoint. director robert eggers gets the most out of his cast and crew to transport audiences to a distinct time period. on a story level, however, the film is lacking the sophisticated edge that helped make the classic dracula adaptations mesmerizing in a terrifying sort of way. this is especially true in the one-note presentation of  the titular count, whose characterization is void of the academic humanity that gave more depth to prior portrayals. nonetheless, it is an entertaining watch."
No Name,5.0,"i watched it at the cinema. the film draws the viewer into the film, making the viewer live the dark experience of the scenarios developed. i left the cinema scared of my own shadow. so that means the film is excellent."
Debra C,3.5,"atmospheric and dark. we know the story, of course, but that didnt tamp down the anticipation of the ending. i dont know why they cast skaarsgard because he was unrecognizable and the character had no real personality. the star, as is always the case with eggers, is the art direction and creation of a whole world of building dread. gave me nightmares all night after."
No Name,5.0,"not for the modern adhd rattled brain.  this is a slower paced masterpiece.  sensational acting, cinematography and a story that ties up with a great ending.  the special effects are on point.   a great remake.  this one should attract an academy award nomination."
No Name,3.0,"the last 1/2 was way more enticing than the opening. slow start, storyline wavers, and just lethargic. almost left and probably should have‚Ä¶"
No Name,0.5,"honestly meh, with such a good cast, i really expected more, so disappointed to see actors i love struggle with a terrible script. the visuals were great, however, i cannot remember the last time i literally wanted to walk out of the cinema, furthermore, the ending literally made me laugh out loud, like this is what i waited 2 hours for? i don't know what it is nowadays with directors and production making 2/3 hour long movies when an hour would suffice, the plot would not have been lost and dragged on for far too long."
No Name,5.0,"great movie. besides all the scenography, i think the edition, the music and the sound are amazong. involves you like you where there, whatching everithing as a ghost inspector"
Charles,5.0,gave me the bram stoker's dracula vibe! it was really good i give it a+ grade
No Name,2.0,no no no. don't waste your precious time
No Name,1.5,"possibly the worst version of the story to date. the acting was absurd.  the eye-straining cinematography was so dark that you could barely see anything through the entire film. putting on a dark filter and shooting everything through it does not automatically make beautiful cinematography. he did the same in the witch, and it was garbage, too.  the storyline flowed like a rope being pushed up a rocky hill and i couldn't take it seriously because orloc looked like john cleese as a vampire."
No Name,5.0,"great cast, great wardrobe/costume design, great cinematography"
annoynoms,5.0,loved the art and basically everything
Everett,2.0,just a movie about a old dude simping.
No Name,3.5,"just left the cinema.. wouldn‚Äôt adress this movie as a horror one, hence some scenes may make you feel umpleasantly uncomfortable. for me it is the power that we give to someone and what they do with it, and how, at some point the only way to cut the cord, is to end with yourself."
No Name,1.5,"very slow and plodding. the plot points are unsurprising and rote for much of the movie and the characters are flat. the scares are pretty unsurprising and ineffective. the vampire is pretty much just a random monster with no real characterization who talks far too slowly (and breathes too loudly, like all the time.) i get that the sex scenes are meant to be transgressive, but they're often abrupt and/or add little of value. the final scene is cinematically interesting, but still, to sum it up, the female character's only worth appears to be her ability to sex the monster to death.  overall, boring and rehashed. the only thing they changed from every other dracula movie was making the sexuality overt instead of implicit."
No Name,4.0,"the atmosphere created in the movie was dark, frighting and just amazing. secondly, the sound effects were guttural. just a small criticism...the antagonist could have been a little scarier...he lacked a little something. other than that, the movie was great"
Alan R,3.0,if wasn't as scary as advertised. it was just okay.
Brian,4.5,a tad long but very good. great scares as well.
judge,5.0,frightening. amazing cinematography.
No Name,5.0,beautifully shot film with great performances all around. a disturbing and visceral commentary on repression and loneliness.
Oliver M,5.0,a remarkable achievement that will make your screen crawl and your jaw drop
No Name,3.5,"it was okay. they should‚Äôve just did a bram stoker‚Äôs remake. although i like that it was inspired by bram stoker‚Äôs dracula, i think it was a bit underwhelming. a bram stoker‚Äôs remake would‚Äôve been more exciting and the overall storyline would‚Äôve been better. it was also very anticlimactic. much left to be desired here."
No Name,4.0,"very scary and unnerving, beautifully shot and directed, terrific acting and production design all come up in this great gothic picture, which sometimes lets it down as it does not know if it wants to be a remake of the 1922 movie or just another adaptation of dracula, which creates a very confusing tone."
No Name,0.5,it was a very bad b movie
Jim S,4.0,visually elegant with occasionally confusing transitions and story threads. sexuality is even more central than in most dracula-derived films and the key to its dramatic resolution.
Mikey Meduim,4.0,"watching the original every year during the halloween season for years. this was great. there are a few differences, but for the most part, it follows the original story. the cinematography was awesome. i really liked how the film looked. t the acting was great, and the cast was on point. the only thing i didn't care for was the look of the title character. the original, in my opinion, was a lot more creepy and horrifying. max did a great job with that. overall, i would definitely recommend this. i will be seeing this again and adding it to my year halloween film runs."
No Name,1.0,"nosferatu was kinda pretty. that is all.  no, i mean, that's really is all it was.  a dull regurgitation of a story told better a thousand times prior, draped in some vaguely interesting cinematography, and a count orlock with more of a throat cold than a character. i am baffled why critics and audience speak highly of it."
Den,5.0,"this movie is an absolute masterpiece. the casting was perfect and the acting superb. william defoe‚Äôs best work since the lighthouse. the guy who wrote and directed this is a cinematic visionary. even if you are not a fan of horror movies, the set designs and cinematography will mesmerize and leave you speechless. it deserves to sweep the oscars."
Joe,4.0,"great special effects, and a story that really needs to be seen on the big screen"
No Name,4.0,"the start of the movie was a bit slow, but the cinematography and the rushing ending make up for it."
Kevin,5.0,incredible movie overall.
No Name,2.0,too predictable and confusing. the end is despicable as it shows a weak nosferatu unable to save himself for the sake of a woman.  the artistic direction was not bad but the amount of celebrities  starring in nosferatu turned the attention elsewhere.
No Name,5.0,"goth is back! robert eggers captures a terrifying story, and involving passion, this is so pure and sexy at the same time. the images are perfect, captivating and gothic, lily gave a unbelievable performance, no cgi needed? maaan"
No Name,1.0,"disgusting; nothing but disgusting, pornographic garbage."
No Name,5.0,i came out of the cinema with this excitement i haven't had since childhood. absolutely loved it.  it adds so much depth to the original story but it's still amazing on it's own and you can tell the director did its homework with all the details and meanings behind every decision.  by far my favorite film i've seen in years <3
No Name,2.0,"i had high hopes foe this movie, but the plot i very hard to keep up with it.  it was boring and couldn't help to fell sleep"
No Name,3.5,"true to his own style, robert eggers develops a solid film where suspense dominates terror. without a doubt, the highlight of nosferatu is the photography and the scenery, which help build the horrific path that we travel as viewers. however, towards the middle of the film it starts to get boring and makes it difficult to follow the plot without getting lost. as a final point to consider, despite the more than 70 prostheses used to create the character of count orlok, the film lacks large shots that honor and show this great work in great detail, leaving a somewhat bitter taste. to sum up, nosferatu is totally worth it with a few strong points that will keep you enthralled for much of the plot, but at the same time it is a particular and more psychological style of cinema that can cause you to lose attention towards the end of the film."
John,4.0,stylish and beautiful and scary.
Stan,2.0,just didn't like it.
Robert M,2.0,fairly boring and predictable.  i would have left but im too frugal.   i guess we need a bad movie once in a while to keep our comparison ability in tact.
No Name,5.0,"a horror movie for the pure of horror heart. the many references to previous tellings of the classic monster do not detract, but rather form a new context where they unify the story. all character names are new here, but we know who they are. we don't know the secret of the grotesque gouhl's undoing or if it is possible until the horrific final scene, but we do feel for the characters grieving the terrifying carnage of an unrelenting beast. the intensity is a lot to bear for most audiences, but the cinematography, sets, costumes and dialog create a plausible world in which a vampire might emerge."
Sean M,2.0,slow moving. and the end was corny.  the all powerful vampire died because it couldn‚Äôt resist and get away from the girl?
No Name,5.0,"i found this movie excellent, both the story and the characters, the gothic atmosphere, so dark, the character of count orlok seemed sinister to me, i can say that it scared me a lot, but what i didn't like about this movie are the screamers, since in today's horror movies nowadays it's very repetitive but i loved it in the end"
No Name,3.0,"nosferatu is a beautiful film with stunning cinematography. the performances were strong across the board. that said, nicholas hoult truly stood out with his fantastic portrayal. the makeup design, costumes, and quirky elements were all exceptional.  however, at times, it watched like the cast was divided between two different films‚Äîa serious period drama/tragic gothic romance‚Äîwhile also leaning into the absurdity of a wacky episode of family guy. i also believe the film could have benefited from trimming about 30 minutes; i don‚Äôt think we would have missed anything significant, as there was quite a bit scenery chewing throughout."
No Name,0.5,"it's just some cheap demon porno. they're just trying to make money off of showing you a ton of twisted demonsex. that's it. it's like they sat in a boardroom somewhere and thought ""we need an edgy angle for our movie that hasn't been done before"" and someone said ""let's really pump up the demon sexuality and throw it in everyone's face"". whatever. welcome to capitalism. it was a bad movie though on top of being really cringeworthy with it's attempted demonsex edginess. and nicholas holt is one of my least favorite actors ever"
Harry R,0.5,it was boring.  i keep falling asleep.  the pace was way too slow.
Cartier,4.0,"a beautifully shot and compelling tale  - definitely a gift for the ""goths"" of the world.  it's a little slow and long some times with some missed opportunities for character development in a few cases - too much time spent on unnecessary nuances."
Barbara  R,4.0,"eerie, great cinematography . better than the typical vampire movie."
No Name,5.0,awesome movie! i love vampires and this is a really good vampire movie!
No Name,1.0,bro i can‚Äôt this movies is ass
Patricia,0.5,hard to understand what they were saying. to drawn out.
tyler,4.0,very dark and errie film. beautiful visuals and cinametography.  acting was also superb.
No Name,0.5,"both crap and disturbing at the same time. comically awful vampire accents, lots of truly gross make-up and vomiting, strange message that the way to beat the devil is to shag him. it was over-long, camp beyond measure, and quite upsetting. stressful and boring at the same time. quite an achievement!"
No Name,0.5,definitely wasn't a 15 and why in hell did they give nosferatu a giant handle bar mustache and a comb over. it totally spoiled it for me orloks tash scared me more then his evil doings
gregory  a,3.5,great script  great cast great movie!!
No Name,4.5,"anyone who posts 1 star reviews only went because they were told the pennywise guy was in it, and are not real functional people. they watch tiktok and nothing else. this was a great movie, not overly sexual. not super scary, but the feeling of dread is everywhere. if you're into atmospheric movies, go see it."
emli,1.0,the movie is not great at all. no active that much. i dont get enjoy that movie. thanks
No Name,5.0,"i loved eggers latest film! a reimagining of the classic horror tale that pays homage to its roots while breathing new life into the genre. the performances are captivating, particularly lily rose and bill skarsgard, whose portrayal of the iconic count orlok is menacing. the film's innovative use of shadow and light enhances its eerie aesthetic, making each scene a visual feast."
No Name,5.0,the best gothic horror movie i have ever seen with a thrilling atmosphere and incredible visuals. an excellent cast and a tense and atmospheric score. a return to form for the horror genre.
G.I. Joe,5.0,"it was an excellent reboot of the original 1922 version. the plot and the characters were very faithful to the original - i was impressed. i am not a fan of horror movies, but this one at least was a classic - and it didn't disappoint."
Matt,0.5,horrible! slow start. over acting.
