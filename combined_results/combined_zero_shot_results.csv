No Name,5.0,"fantastic movie, one of the great epics",positive
No Name,2.0,it‚Äôs not aged well. the action scenes are quite cringeworthy and the plot is advanced by characters who just tell you what their motives are.,negative
Paul T,5.0,best movie of all time,positive

No Name,5.0,this first movie of the trilogy is an absolute masterpiece. love it!,positive
No Name,2.5,"it's a very enjoyable average movie. the cinematography, effects, message, villain,  and action are  all masterpieces. however that is not enough to make it a masterpiece of a movie. the characters, aside from the main agent(who is flawless i might add), were poorly written, very poorly  written. this movie's biggest problem: telling the audience something is different from explaining it to them. you can tell me the neo is the chosen one, you can tell me that morpheus views him as the chosen one, but you have to explain why. this movie saying ""well, it;s because morpheus views him as one"" is not an explanation, because this movie established morpheus's credibility. the romance was mediocre at best, at least you could tell it was going to happen unlike other movies that just shove it out of left it. i suppose that's something in this movie's favor, but it still doesn't elevate the romance out of nowhere. addiotnally, this movie has what i like to call the ""pointless side characters problem"", when there's too many characters, poorly written, that just endlessly remove screen time from the main characters, leading to every single character(well almost in this case), being underdeveloped. i didn't even understand why neo wanted to find the matrix, this movie never once answered that question. it's also incomprehensible how he got so good at the matrix. this is a critique one has to be careful of, because it could easily be thrown at every single sci-fi movie. often times i think it's thrown around unjustifiably, but this movie is not one of those times. there is no logical reason why neo should be able to beat the agent. because this movie never explained why he was looking for the matrix, and why he was the chosen one! in star wars, luke destroying the death star is justifiable, because the movie explained why he had the power of the force, and obi-wan helped him through the power of the force. you don't need some elaborate, 20 minute exposition, something as simple as what star wars did was enough. another thing i will point out, the acting, ranges from bad to mediocre. i think reeves was miscast in this role, which might be the biggest hot take in this review(which is a hot take in it of itself). his gives just a dry performance, which is not always a bad thing (works for jon wick), but it does not work for this movie. there is never an ounce of emotion shown in his face, and that really lower the quality of the movie. that pretty much goes for every character in this movie. except for the agent smith. hugo weaving  gives a superb performance. it's exactly how a character like that is supposed to act. and his motivations were explained. he wants to be free of the world he operates in, and by getting to zion, he will achieve that. perfect! that was a 3 minute scene at most, maybe even a minute and a half. that's all you need. i'm not even going to lie, i found myself rooting for him during the climax. this movie gave its villain(well maybe sub villain, since technically the matrix is the villain), a motivation with an explanation, but not's main character.  how sad is that. overall, it's just an average movie. if it wasn't for the villain, this movie would be a bad movie with great action, special effects, and great cinematography. those things alone are not enough to make a movie good. yes, without them a movie will be lowered in quality. but having a main character, whose motivations, and greatness are unexplained, poorly written side characters, a bland romance, and making your villain more lovable(even the motivations of who he works for are evil) than your main character are flaws to great to make this movie anything more than mediocre.",negative
No Name,3.5,"whilst the visual effects used in this film hold up excellently to this day, it is let down by inconsistencies within its plot or premise and a massive lack of variation in the pacing of its fight scenes. yet, it is home to some of the best scenes in movie history, and the concept which it attempts to explore is revolutionary for film-making. i admire that about it.",positive

No Name,4.5,"revisiting 'the matrix' for its 25th anniversary feels like stepping into a cinematic experience that remains as relevant as ever. this film was ahead of its time, blending groundbreaking vfx with thought-provoking themes about reality, control, and technology. the wachowskis crafted a world that feels more relatable today than ever, in an age where ai, virtual reality, and questions of individual autonomy are part of everyday conversation. the film's iconic action sequences, groundbreaking bullet-dodging effects, and philosophical tones make it a timeless piece of cinema. watching it again, it‚Äôs clear 'the matrix' was a blueprint for the now & future.",positive

No Name,2.5,"yuppie office job venting movie.  kind of like a high tech sci-fi shoot-em-up game.  bullets apparently as harmless as peas from a pea shooter; punches are like mosquito bites.  i think with enough peas and mosquitoes, anyone would at least eventually die.  you know the reason: so they can put tons and tons of violence in without actually killing the characters off before milking them for all the theatrics they can.  nothing original about that.  and just like in a fairy tale, at the end a magic kiss brings the prince back to life. i had to finally watch this thing just so i could figure out how come i've had to listen to all this pill nonsense for the past 2 decades.  as you can see, it was not very high on my bucket list having put off this deed until now.  i personally thought it sucked, but then i could respect that other people might like it if it was their style.  e.g. possibly a good movie for catharsis if you sit at a computer all day wearing a suit, and dislike cops and your boss.",negative

No Name,4.0,"the matrix is one of the most ambitious and captivating sci-fi films of all time. the action is electric, the characters are strong and there are legendary moments peppered throughout. where the film is lacking is in the actual human aspect; the romance is underdeveloped and neo's life in the matrix is superficial (why do we need a scene of his boss disciplining him?).  that being said, the fight sequences are incredibly entertaining and the entire idea of the matrix plays with your mind. i honestly fell asleep multiple times watching the film and had to go back and watch it again. from the slow motion to the muted colors, it was easy to doze off. however, once the climactic moments hit, i was enthralled. the helicopter scene is great and the final fight sequences hit hard.  i'm curious where the franchise will go from here, but this film is a brilliant start.  best character: tank best quote: ""there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path."" - morpheus best scene: the bullet dodge best piece of score: ""he's the one alright""",positive

No Name,4.5,a movie which managed to stay in our hearts.,positive
No Name,5.0,"the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot an ordinary sci-fi movie. it's released in 1999, it's mind-blowing with story and special effects. beyond cool fights, it asks: is our world real, or a simulated prison?  the key to the matrix's success was combining action with big ideas.neo, a computer hacker who feels like something is wrong with the world. his life takes a crazy turn when he meets morpheus, a mysterious friend who reveals the shocking truth that the world neo lives in is a fake reality called the matrix. this confuses neo and sets him on a mission to find out who he is and fight the system.  what this movie does very well is create a world that feels both normal and creepy at the same time. it will be a world with busy roads. the phone rings. and computer screen even though it is something we encounter in everyday life. but there was a strange feeling. it's like something isn't right. it exploits our fears about technology and the blurred line between what is real and what is not. are we really alive or are we just like characters in a simulated world that we don't even understand?  the film's special effects were amazing for their time, especially the famous ""bullet moment"" sequence where everything slows down. this isn't just a cool fight scene. they have a deeper meaning. they represent neo's awakening. the moment he breaks free from the matrix and begins to see things clearly.  but the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmore than just a movie. it delves into some rather complicated concepts regarding philosophy and religion. think about things like ideas about choices. this movie makes you think about free will. if our world isn't real will there really be a choice for us? is there a bigger purpose? or are we just stuck in a simulated world?  the characters in this film are more than just fighters. neo's journey from confused hacker to potential hero is thrilling to watch. keanu reeves plays the role of neo perfectly. showcasing her growing confusion and determination, laurence fishburne plays morpheus, the mysterious leader who believes in neo. carrie-anne moss plays trinity. a skilled fighter who becomes neo's friend,and hugo weaving is very creepy and cool as agent smith. characters that represent the system that controls everything. the script of the film and the way these characters interact with each other is exciting and makes the film interesting and not boring.  the matrix isn't perfect. some sections may feel a little long-winded. and some people may think that keanu reeves doesn't show enough emotion. but these minor issues don't detract from the film's overall greatness. the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa groundbreaking sci-fi film that perfectly blends action, big ideas, and stunning visuals.  it's a movie that will stay with you long after it's over. it's a movie that can be watched no matter how much time has passed. with a script that is filled with insights and philosophy, it invites you to question the world around you. think about the choices you make. and consider the true meaning of freedom. what i love about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, it still holds up. you will learn more about this. it's a cinematic experience that reminds us that sometimes the most important truths are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be discovered. whether you're a sci-fi action fan or just looking for a movie that will make you think differently, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsomething i recommend you watch at least once in your life.  5/5",positive

No Name,4.5,"'the matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'metropolis', 'blade runner', 'back to the future', 'star wars original trilogy', 'alien' and 'aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.  it is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between neo and trinity being 'the matrix's' sole weak spot. this ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.  particularly striking about 'the matrix' is its production values. simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. so much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.  use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. andy and larry wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even lewis carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.  action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, kung fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.  keanu reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. carrie anne moss is strong. even better are an imposingly charismatic laurence fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing joe pantoliano and a deliciously wicked hugo weaving.  summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park.",positive

No Name,5.0,"keanu reeves, in his role as the enigmatic neo, delivers an unforgettable performance that solidifies his status as one of hollywood's most versatile actors. reeves brings an incredible depth to neo, effortlessly transitioning from a bewildered office worker to a fearless warrior, all while maintaining a relatable vulnerability. his portrayal of neo's journey from skepticism to self-discovery is nothing short of breathtaking. reeves' presence on-screen is magnetic, capturing the audience's attention from the very first frame and keeping them engaged throughout the film.  however, it is not only reeves' acting prowess that makes ""the matrix"" a groundbreaking experience. the film's storyline is a true marvel of innovation and creativity. the concept of a simulated reality controlled by machines, while humans remain oblivious, was an entirely fresh idea at the time. ""the matrix"" seamlessly blends philosophy, action, and intrigue, weaving together a complex narrative that challenges the boundaries of our perception. the film presents philosophical questions about the nature of reality and free will, leaving audiences contemplating their own existence long after the credits roll.  the wachowski siblings deserve immense praise for their visionary approach to storytelling. their bold and imaginative direction brings the film's groundbreaking ideas to life, creating a visually striking world that remains visually stunning even years after its release. the use of slow-motion action sequences and groundbreaking special effects revolutionized the way action movies were made, influencing countless films that followed in its wake.  ""the matrix"" is a triumph of both cinematic artistry and intellectual stimulation. it combines keanu reeves' outstanding performance with an innovative and thought-provoking story, resulting in an unforgettable viewing experience. its impact on popular culture and cinema cannot be overstated, and it remains a testament to the power of daring storytelling and exceptional acting. if you haven't seen ""the matrix,"" prepare to be transported to a world where reality is not what it seems, and be prepared to question everything you know.",positive
No Name,2.5,i'm going to be honest‚Ä¶the matrix doesn't do it for me. it's a little odd at times almost like the story isn't thought through enough and kind of fast pace for me. it had the same problem the original star wars had but at least they made up for it masterfully. i just can't say the same for this one.,negative

No Name,4.5,"a classic. still confused as to how it got the r rating, though.",negative
No Name,4.5,"spoilers this film follows neo, a software developer by day, underground computer hacker by night. a man named morpheus shows neo the reality of his world, that him and everyone else are living out their lives in a fake simulation developed by the robots that now inhabit earth. it is prophesized that neo is the chosen one, and will be the hope the human race needs to free themselves from the clutches of machines.   i had high expectations before watching this movie - everyone knows the matrix, and that it's influence and references transcend cinema. i can happily say it was better than i expected! what a world to get immersed in for two hours. i loved the dystopian future setting, and found it very reminiscent of blade runner with the low key lighting, constant rain, and accompanying foreboding presence. it stood on its own two feet however with the present day earth production design and the plot of machines now controlling earth. i found it breathtaking watching the scenes and flashbacks that took place on earth, the black clouds with no sun, billions of humans encapsulated in endless spires, robots scouring the land. morpheus' ship looked incredibly 90s sci-fi, but it was great, and watching it travers the sewers was sweet. all in all the production design, costumes, sets and cgi in this movie are incredible. the look and feel is 10/10.  now onto the story. i loved the plot, humans trapped by robots in a simulation to keep them content while the robots suck their energy. a group of rebel fighters free the chosen one from his mundane fake life and train him, showing him the mind bending reality. as a viewer you feel right there with neo, because well, a lot of us live the lives neo did. all of a sudden hes being told it is all fake and we watch him struggle to process it - as a viewer i was truly side-by-side with neo and was trying to wrap my head around it too. the logic behind the matrix and the rules we learn through morpheus and the crew are all believable given the context, not to mention so incredibly cool. neo being the ""chosen one"" can be cliche, but in this movie i accepted it and didn't mind. up until the final 30 minutes i was convinced that they had the wrong guy. the payoff at the end when neo finally kills and agent is one of those rare moments where emotion, action and understanding come together in a perfect climax. let me also mention how well done the action is. great shootouts with acrobatic stunts, high stakes and uniqueness - so crazy this was back in 99.   this movie has undertones of some deep and thought-provoking themes. free will vs fate, existentialism, being controlled by a tyranical force, oppression, etc.   i was a fan of the love that blossoms between neo and trinity, but i have to say it did come a bit abruptly at the end. we get hints the entire movie that trinity feels something for him, but neo gives us next to nothing. a few more moments between them would have really cemented their feelings. another big thing i feel like is never explained is why the robots created the matrix in the first place. if they created it to keep humans sedated and satisfied so that they inevitably turn to energy - why not just trap them in the pods minus the matrix? why go through the trouble of giving a race you went to war with a whole fake universe? just grow and harvest us like you've been doing and keep us trapped or sedated. idk that question was plaguing me the whole movie. another thing is the use of guns for all the action. if the matrix is a computer simulation, and these agents and neo can see it for what it is and exploit it, i would have liked some crazy action beyond guns. there was so much more potential for mind bending fights - i mean these people can literally make this simulation their playground. its also worth a note that keanu is the best worst actor ever. he was better here than in john wick, but i didn't find much impressive in terms of his acting.   overall, the matrix is an expansive sci-fi movie with incredible action sequences, beautiful sets, world design and a mind bending story that stays grounded. i loved this film from start to finish.",positive

No Name,5.0,"people think of the matrix as the first modern sci-fi movie. if you like science fiction movies, you should put this one at the top of your list. a movie has a lot of action and a complex matrix universe that many people don&#39;t fully understand. the film that lana and andy wachowski produced entered imdb&#39;s top 20 with an 8.7 rating. keanu reeves&#39; character neo is the subject of this movie. people depend on chatgpt a lot these days. openai made chatgpt, a chatbot with artificial intelligence. this movie shows what might happen if artificial intelligence takes over and runs the world instead of people. in the year 2199, robots run this planet. you might want to know how a robot came to be in charge of this planet. to find out, you only need to go back a few decades, when people invented super- artificial intelligence. but what&#39;s interesting about this new ai is that it can feel like a person, which means that even robots have feelings. robots are used in every part of everyday life. people came to depend on robots in every way. but people used the robot as if it were a toy. but when a robot doesn&#39;t do enough for its owner, the owner just throws it away without feeling bad about it. so, they began to feel like they were being pushed around. they didn&#39;t know what the robots were up to. robots built their own country, and because they don&#39;t sleep and don&#39;t get stressed out like humans, their economy is growing very quickly every day. the robots&#39; economies are better than humans, and this worries them a lot. they were planning something very, very strange! as i already said, robots don&#39;t sleep or get stressed out, but to stay active, they need to charge themselves. sunlight is the only thing that gives them energy, and people were planning something that had to do with sunlight. people&#39;s most strange idea was when they finally figured out how to make &quot;dark strom,&quot; which makes dark clouds in the sky and blocks the sun. because of this, robots couldn&#39;t get enough sunlight to power up. the lack of sunlight was also bad for people, so this experiment didn&#39;t work out well for them either. greenland became a desert because the trees were dying. humans were at war with robots, so robots started to think about how to solve this problem, which they did. people couldn&#39;t win the war because robots came up with the idea that &quot;when a human brain activates for a function, it makes bio-electricity.&quot; robots were abducting people to make bioelectricity. people no longer have to have sex to have children. in movies, we can see many bodies that have been kept alive in cisterns. but no matter how many times the robot updates it, the matrix always has a glitch or bug. neo is also called &quot;the one&quot; in the movie. glitch can&#39;t affect neo in any way, which is why he&#39;s a threat to the matrix. the movie shows how neo started the war against machines to save humanity. not a single spoiler! enjoy the film!",negative
No Name,5.0,"the matrix is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and influential movies of all time, and there are many reasons why it is regarded as a great film. from its innovative visual effects to its thought-provoking philosophical themes, the matrix has become a classic that continues to captivate audiences more than two decades after its release.  one of the key strengths of the matrix is its groundbreaking use of special effects. the film's ""bullet time"" effect, which slows down the action to a fraction of its normal speed, has become an iconic visual motif that has been emulated countless times in movies and other forms of media. this effect, along with the film's other impressive visual effects, helped to create a truly immersive and unforgettable cinematic experience.  but the matrix is more than just a technical achievement. at its core, the movie is a philosophical exploration of reality and what it means to be human. the film's central premise, that humanity is trapped in a simulated reality created by machines, raises profound questions about the nature of reality and the limits of human knowledge. the matrix challenges viewers to question their own perceptions of the world around them and to consider the possibility that there may be more to reality than meets the eye.  the film also features memorable characters and performances that have become iconic in their own right. keanu reeves delivers a compelling performance as neo, the film's protagonist, while laurence fishburne's portrayal of morpheus is both charismatic and wise. the villainous agent smith, played by hugo weaving, is a menacing and unforgettable antagonist who embodies the oppressive nature of the matrix itself.  ultimately, the matrix is a great movie because it manages to be both intellectually stimulating and visually stunning. it combines cutting-edge special effects with a thought-provoking exploration of reality and humanity, creating a cinematic experience that is both entertaining and meaningful. it's a film that has stood the test of time and continues to inspire new generations of moviegoers.",positive
No Name,4.0,"an absolute classic entry in the science fiction genre. i think that it survives time pretty well, although there are aspects that have lost momentum over the years. overall, it is a very enjoyable watch and definitely should be enjoyed as a true popcorn movie.",positive
No Name,5.0,"once viewers are able to overcome the fact that these special effects did not stand the test of time, they're still left with a film that is action-packed and encased in a philosophically rich story that revolutionized american cinema. full of a perfect roster of actors (reeves, fishburne, moss, and more), the matrix tells the story of the future (or the present?) in which all of humanity has been overtaken by machines in the real world and are plugged into the matrix wherein they live their lives knowing nothing of true reality. the simulation called life that we all experience could all be within a computer simulation dictated by mechanical overlords who are, in reality, harvesting us for our collective heat and energy. there exist small factions of individuals who have broken free from the matrix and have seen the desolate reality in which the world actually exists and they work to help free humanity by working within (and sometimes outside of) the system to which we've all been enslaved. when one of these resistance factions, led by morpheous (laurence fishburne), gets word of a computer hacker (keanu reeves) living within the confines of the program who fits a prophecy regarding the absolution of mankind, they work quickly to try and free him from the matrix so that he might lead humanity to freedom. it's the sort of plot that might seem contrived now that there have been so many imitators, but for the turn of the century it was as absorbing as it was fascinating. there is plenty to love here, despite the one-time revolutionary special effects seeming quite dated. if you find yourself a purveyor of turn-of-the-century action movies you owe it to the original standout that made sci-fi action stylish without sacrificing compelling storytelling.",positive

No Name,4.0,"now, with john wick chapter 4 releasing, i thought it would be a great time to revisit another one of keanu reeve's most well-known roles. neo in the matrix. this movie is still so good after all this time. the action is so fast paced and along with some great editing make for some insanely creative action set pieces. the visual effects are amazing, at least for their time. the story is also pretty gripping and the villains are so much fun to watch, but it's not perfect, that's for sure. this movie really overstays it's welcome, so that when a cool scene comes at the end, i have completely fallen out of the story and just end up bored. the drama is also just not that interesting. i don't care for any of the other characters except for neo, trinity and morpheus and even the drama between neo and trinity is so uninteresting. a lot of good, a share of bad stuff and some truly amazing movie moments.",positive

No Name,5.0,"for roughly the next ten years after this came out pretty much every action scene in every movie tried to imitate this in some shape or form animated, small screen, big screen, and even commercials. it's very clear why, many have imitated it and none really have ever come close to making the elements here work so well in this all time classic. the acting in this is phenomenal. yes it has that classic 00's emotionless style of acting for a lot of character and arguably this is the film that popularized that style, but it works here mainly because of how surreal the plot is and it fits the characters. neo is awesome to watch become a total badass, smith is one of the best villains i've seen, and morpheus is a great supporting character. trinity is very good but her emotionless style sometimes misses like in the end when she confesses her love and despite small signs throughout it would've been better to actually see it more. though she is a badass also. the cinematography and special effects all hold up incredibly well and are some of the best from this era and look incredible still and fit the ascetics of the world. the pacing and editing are excellent as well which is no small task handling the expose and never making it feel overloaded. the music is really good also. everyone should give this a try. is it overrated? to an extent maybe but on its own merits its a excellent sci-fi/action film.",positive

No Name,3.5,"i gave the movie four stars for of the flashy special effects. otherwise it was a passable science fiction movie. the entire premise of the film reads like a modern, hollywood science fiction update of ancient buddhist or hindu philosophy. of course we all live in a matrix--we live in two of them: a complex of lies created by people in power to keep us from realizing our full potential, as well as a fiction created for us as souls on a physical planet. anyone who's read the book, ""autobiography of a yogi"" will fathom that much. the world of the red pill certainly doesn't look appealing; i can't imagine most people taking it. the blue pill will always be the selection of the majority because the concept of ""freedom"" has always been grossly exaggerated. no human being is ever utterly free--regardless of the circumstances. after reading the synopsis of the garbled screenplay of the second film, i certainly wouldn't spend the money to rent it.",negative

No Name,4.0,"the matrix is the 1999 classic directed by the wachowski siblings. it tells the story of neo played by keanu reeves who is asked by a mysterious man called morpheus played by lawrence fishburne to go on an adventure that reveals that neo's reality is not reality but a cyber world created by ai robots who enslaved humanity. this classic film introduced many concepts that have become part of pop culture such as taking the red pill and it has many philosophical influences from alice in wonderland all the way to the bible. its a science fiction thriller filled with high stunt action sequences including the iconic slowmo. the acting is not always as great though the philosophical morpheus played by fisher is a compelling character and hugo weaving as the antagonists agent smith is a fierce villain. matrix is a cultural phenomenon and although the effects are starting to age, the film still holds up many years later.",positive

No Name,4.5,"""i'm trying to free your mind, neo. but i can only show you the door. you're the one that has to walk through it.""  i've never been great at philosophy, but my head is exploding at the many different philosophical questions the film explores while still keeping even footing on all of them and keeping them from a messy disaster, largely because as the quote above states outright, it's like an intro course, a 101. the movie only shows the start, but you have the choice to dig further.  and the movie completely gives as much as you're willing to put into it. there's ideas of body and gender dysphoria, made clearest at its inclinations of body horror and the control of what you are perceived as by others, made both physical and mental. what do you define as real, the realistic scientific hypothesis or something more spiritual than that? the matrix entails the systems of control and its chains, describing itself as a political government controlling force (rage against the machine in the credits makes this completely unsubtle), but it's also mental self-imposed limitations, with clear zen inspiration, as well as a social control of who you are. the physical limitations to break the boundaries (learning martial arts) is still not as important as the mental limitations, that ultimately removing the obstacles (revolution) is not necessarily physically violent but a mental choice of enlightenment.  and again, somehow this does not end up a mess. even its biggest thread, the one it hammers home the most, fate and free will, still stands tall throughout. neo does not have to be the one, it's up to himself whether he believes he is or not. that the motivation you have does not have to align with destiny as it's prescribed, and the path you choose to walk down is still completely up to you. the call is not binding.  it's crazy, also, how much this movie works with the theory of gender identity, if you're willing to read it that far. the body horror isn't just for show. when the truth of you being a slave to others' concept of identity is learnt, you can at once find your body a prison, chains putting you down, finding your body horrifying and terrifying, made physical through the lens of sci-fi as metal lumps on your skin, a perceivably permanent mark, and you have to come to terms with your physical self. ultimately, even physically going against that boundary is different from the mental dysphoria, that it alone is its own self-imposed limitation. you can learn everything about how your body works (the programs to learn fighting and anything you need to know), but it ultimately does not remove how you define yourself mentally and how you are capable of changing.   this movie fucking owns is what i'm trying to say.  you can choose not to engage with any of its readings and be totally fine. visually it is a stunning film strung well by its hong kong influences, with great wirework. i think the best fight scene that shows how well put together the choreo as well as edited is smith vs. neo, how it understands fundamentals like showing a punch twice for effect, while grounding the fights in its airy spirituality. wachowskis really love catching the eye with pan shots, both vertical and horizontal. thinking of the one take of them behind the walls as they vertically climb, claustrophobic but still visually interesting. this whole film does a great job of making the frame claustrophobic. good example is in the office where neo sees the agents and crouches, keeping the whole cubicle in frame.  it can't be said how much visually this inspired so many things later that i came into contact with before this movie. a list would be longer than my lifespan, especially its influence on how guns are used in fiction period, but i think the craziest one i noticed this run around was how half-life 2 uses a sequence near the end of the film of neo running away from the agents up a staircase through an apartment, almost completely visually re-created in hl2 when running from the combine in nearly the same scenario. inspiration begets inspiration, considering how greatly well read the film already is, taking stuff from baudrillard and alice in wonderland in equal measure.  i firmly approve of don davis' work on the score. the horns here are great, and the matrix theme now with its blaring at the start fading into the code is recognizable everywhere. also when the violins get furious.... it bangs. soundtrack, on the other hand, good-ish? i'm completely down for the credits rage against the machine song, having bars like ""departments of police, the judges, the feds / networks at work, keepin' people calm / you know they went after king / when he spoke out on vietnam""... but it also goes right into a meh marilyn manson song... also marilyn manson.  it's not nearly always like that, it has some good big beat and trip hop music throughout, like the seamless transition in the rave from massive attack to the prodigy, and the rob dougan song with the red dress scene is good.  the characters themselves are pretty good although this movie does take the approach of more motivations as symbols than fully fleshed out characters, such as cypher being the blatant rejection of truth (ignorance is bliss), and while trinity does have her own agency to a point something feels off about the romance, and whether or not it earns the possible true love's kiss it spins.  i'm not sure why people dislike keanu's performance so much here. to me the common man not becoming super emotional on the outside as much as through his motivations in his actions works well for what eventually becomes a spiritual figure throughout the trilogy, or so i've been told. carrie-anne moss, laurence fishburne, and hugo weaving outperform everybody else though. i will die before forgetting weaving's ""smith"".  there's so many layers to the film, even if small, to unravel here, but overall easily worth my time to come back. gender dysphoria, government control, zen/buddhist/taoist influences, alice, communism... the movie was made for me. and it fucks.",negative

No Name,5.0,"all style and substance for one of cinema's groundbreaking sci-fi classics!  directors lilly wachowski and lana wachowski changed science-fiction and action thrillers forever with their iconic neo-noir sci-fi thriller the matrix (1999). the wachowski sisters' script is full of pastiche and homages to dark city, tron, and blade runner among westerns and martial arts films. their directing style is frenetic action shootouts with bullets blazing and fantastic visual effects to the moody atmosphere of neo-noir aesthetics. the matrix has it all with slow motion bullet time combat, bullet dodges, fearsome machine sentinels, and ruthless computer program vanguard agents. the wachowski's high concept sci-fi ideas can get confusing, though everything is explained from our reality being a computer simulation called the matrix to the real world falling into darkness after a machine uprising. it's chilling and fascinating in every scene as you attempt to figure out all of these mind numbing concepts.  i appreciate and understand the wachowski sisters' complex sci-fi story more now that i'm older as neo's choices were an allegory for their own transgender transformations, while also speaking to humanity's endless desire for technological progress into artificial intelligence. having machines with advanced ai wipe out humanity, only to harvest us for energy after we destroy the sun is a mind boggling plot, but a compelling dramatic narrative. i adore the romance drama between neo and trinity as well among the other themes like going against fate by choosing your own path to walk. the wachowski sisters never quite wrote any film as succinct and absorbing as the matrix, honestly. the matrix really is a one of a kind miracle of filmmaking.  canadian actor keanu reeves is iconic as neo in the matrix with his stoic confusion and endearing normality. keanu can be the everyman as well as a tender romantic hero once he is focused and confident as the one. american acting legend laurence fishburne is enthralling as morpheus with his endless wisdom and shocking reveals. canadian actress carrie-anne moss is sultry and sincere as trinity with her fearless fight sequences and sweet romantic moments with neo. australian acting hero hugo weaving is terrifying, hilarious, and intriguing as the rogue agent smith with his pure hatred of dissidents and loathing of humanity. his enunciation makes his every line memorable and seething with an inner rage. american character actor joe pantoliano is fantastic as the dejected and selfish cypher.  gloria foster's oracle is charming and insightful with a unique appeal. marcus chong is fun as the nervous and excitable tank. paul goddard and robert taylor nail the cold robotic movements and tone of agents brown and jones, respectively. you can feel the difference in how hugo weaving's agent smith is supposed to be unraveling into a mechanical vendetta and raving ai personality. julian arahanga's apoc is cool, but it is belinda mcclory's switch who utters the chilling famous last words, ""not like this."" anthony ray parker's boisterous dozer and matt doran's zealous mouse are interesting. marc aden gray's choi sounds just like john malkovich. every matrix actor and actress fulfilled their character acting role to perfection.  editor zach staenberg cuts so sharply and quickly from wide shots to close-ups that you'll never get bored for the matrix' 136 minutes. cinematographer bill pope brings the matrix to life with gorgeous and creative shots that utilize john gaeta's innovative visual effects to their full potential. from the startling agent smith morphing from other people into hugo weaving to the breathtaking close-up of neo and trinity kissing with literal sparks flying in the background. the matrix has a neo-noir style and bill pope really outdid himself with these fierce and unforgettable shots. owen paterson's production design looks gritty from ruined buildings to the chilling robotic world and mechanisms everywhere. all the practical effects are so gross and scary.  composer don davis has this inspiring melody for his score to the matrix that i love. the ending with rage against the machine is exhilarating to the main theme of the matrix being eerie and exciting. all the rave rob zombie music to the symphonic unsettling orchestration is all brilliant. the sound department went crazy with the emphasized hits and ambiance to the machines churning and revving to life.   costume designers kym barrett and lyn askew must have found all the black leather and latex in the 1990's as everyone looks slick and unique in the matrix. from agent smith's tailored suits to neo's trench coat or trinity's sexy black leotard. deborah taylor's creative make-up makes keanu reeves even more handsome, laurence fishburne even cooler, and carrie-anne moss ethereal as trinity. i just love her so much.  in conclusion, the matrix is worth seeing again and again as it is smart and thrilling sci-fi.",positive

No Name,3.0,"with as big as of a movie fan i am, this is actually the first time i‚Äôve seen the matrix, and after finally seeing it i feel underwhelmed. despite the revolutionary special effects, high octane action sequences, a promising story and a great ensemble cast, the film falters in its overall execution. the story is beyond overly confusing with large amounts of exposition to catch up the viewers on what‚Äôs happening. the film asks intelligent existential questions and develops an intriguing universe to accompany it, but the interest level begins to fall when it is over-beard with confusing explanations as to what‚Äôs going on with characters i don‚Äôt find too particularly engaging. although the film is a historic standpoint in special effects and storytelling, in my opinion the film feels dull and exhaustingly boring.",negative
No Name,5.0,"this is my third revisit to this iconic movie which has significant value in terms of its philosophy at the background, its sci-fi components with the action it blends all these with. one can understand it more if one tries to connect it to the simulation theory, or baudrillard's simulacra and simulation book (which is also shown in this first movie at one of the beginning scenes). there is much to learn and much to think about, and it really gives you the thrill you search for.",positive

No Name,5.0,"""the matrix is a masterpiece"" is definitely one of the most redundant phrases in movies history. the action sequences are dazzling, the soundtrack is enervating and the main trio is majestic. neo looks like a character who was written for keanu reeves, and i can say the same for lawrence fishburne as morpheus and carrie-anne moss as trinity. hugo weaving as agent smith is another show, and his voice work is possibly the best thing of the film alongside the action sequences and their revolutionary visual and special effects. joe pantoliano is also funny and i loved the twist about who is the oracle. i thought she would look like tilda swinton's character in doctor strange or something more spiritual, but no, she looks like a grandma and lives in an apartment like my grandma's! what a universe. this film successfully convinces the spectator to take the red pill.",positive

No Name,3.0,we all got into this film when it was at the cinema due to debuting first-seen special effects; or to a lesser extent if you were an australian as it was one of the few big hollywood films made in sydney where we all can still to this day recognise major landmarks we walk past daily.  the concept and story line is decent although the movie hasn't aged well and is pretty hard to watch now 20 years later.,positive

No Name,3.0,"review of resurrections.  as a fan and not a fanatic, resurrections relies too much on an assumption that the audience cares about the affection of neo and trinity for one another. fanatics probably do; fans don't.  there is little sense of triumph in the story's climax: neo's successful rescue of and reunion with trinity, especially at cost of their friends' great pain and suffering.  and for what? neil patrick harris' character the analyst is correct, most people int the fantasy world of the matrix prefer the fantasy.  his character, by the way, is the most fun and the most interesting.  sad but true, imho, the script and execution are too derivative of the earlier editions of the matrix, and fail you bring enough that builds upon them, for keanu reeves, carrie-anne moss, or anyone else to rescue the final third of the movie from proving the project a disappointment.  attempts to bring sympathetic or humorous robot mascots to the narrative are just embarrassing, not innovative.  the high five had me cringing. the special effects are cutting-edge, but exactly what we saw in earlier editions, and therefore were predictable more than breathtaking.  the fight scenes were duplicative, too long, and largely pointless.  it seemed the producers and director intended simply to remind the audience of what they enjoyed when the matrix was new and fresh. nostalgia cannot carry a movie that is two and a half hours in length. eventually, the viewer realizes that the excitement one has anticipating and awaiting never arrives. neo's abilities within the matrix are really rather trite, at times unintentionally laughable, compared to the ballet he pulled off in the earlier films.  fanatics will love this film and see it more than once. that'll help the movie make money. fans of the original matrix edition will be reminded of how unique it was and still remains, and will be rather bored with the apparent lack of similar inspiration that seems to have this attempted remake.",negative

No Name,5.0,the movie was a total game changer.,positive
No Name,4.0,"whoa, dude, it's the matrix. this is like the movie, right? maybe 20 years ago, sure! its prophecies of technological dystopia are spot on, almost like a very early black mirror, but they aren't as mind-blowing today simply because they aren't really that far away. does this make the movie better or worse? i dunno; up to you, i guess.  i'm sure i'm not the first one to say this, but i love keanu reeves. he plays this movie pretty straight, despite the somewhat cheesy script, but it works. carrie-anne moss also stands out in the cast, even if her character is a little one-dimensional (but to be fair, pretty much every character in this movie is one-dimensional). the special effects and technology feel a little dated, even the scenes which take place 200 years in the future, but i'm sure it felt very futuristic in 1999.  what i love about this movie is how it plays with tropes without forcing them into the plot. it cleverly introduces a kung-fu battle between student and teacher, an all-knowing prophet with mysterious revelations, and a semi-reluctant chosen one using its established pretense in a way that makes complete sense. it knows that it's paying some homages, but it never feels forced or satirical.  now unfortunately, i found the final act to be absolutely riddled with plot holes. why didn't they just spawn directly in the hostage room instead of walking through a security gate to get there? what was the point of the bomb in the building? how were they able to use a stolen helicopter's gatling gun to fill a room with bullets while never hitting the hostage once? and why didn't they just show up with a helicopter in the first place?? it makes less sense the more you think about it.  flaws and all, the matrix is a classic with an influence that's hard to overstate. it asks a lot of deep philosophical questions which are still relevant today. it's a film that's smarter than it appears, and also dumber, but in a mostly good way.",positive
No Name,4.5,morpheous and agent smith have now become cinematic folklore,negative
No Name,4.0,"while there are some facets of this movie that were imperfect even at the time (such as slow fight execution, some nonsensical pretentious dialogue and the occasional dull camera angles), the matrix really was a game-changer, and for very good reason.  it not only created a massively engaging world of its own, using western storytelling tropes to re-explore eastern story concepts, but it even enhanced various genres in themselves; hollywood action here discovered how useful things like martial arts can be with a high-concept adventure, and the kung fu genre itself was reinvented with this somewhat, as that genre itself was struggling to break away from the two clich√©d setups: murdered master & fight contest (seriously, that was one of the main reasons why project a & police story were so revolutionary; they conceived entirely different paradigms for the genre without compromising its believability).  and to this day, you'll still see sci-fi kung fu movies, and they're generally awesome, as well as (thankfully) quite a ways different from the matrix as well.  much of the movie still holds up, and the story hits those timeless story ideas that will likely always be interesting to explore, and the ending is very, very cathartically satisfying.  the acting is generally good with hugo weaving being particularly excellent as the immensely despicable agent smith (his role also being easily the best written), and watching him meet his impactful and pain-filled end is woefully gratifying.  the only real problem is that the sequel, the matrix reloaded, dumped on almost everything good about this movie, not only retconning half of the cool ideas, but undoing numerous satisfying story beats in this movie, but those are faults of the sequel, not this movie.  instead, if you just watch this movie by itself, it's a great time - it was awesome 22 years ago, and is still kinda awesome now.",positive

No Name,4.5,the movie still holds up to this day and the ideas are still worth talking about,positive
No Name,4.5,"to be clear- this is a a review of this film only, not the matrix series.  the matrix is one of the most iconic, stunning, and transformative films of the 21st century (1999 really).   it is perhaps one of the most important films ever.   it transformed  filmmaking with its visual impact as well as its substantive content.   its genuinely original look at the world and the place of human beings in the ""matrix"" is complex and compelling but addictively engaging.   keanu reeves, carrie moss, and laurence fishburne, and hugo weaving give the performances of their careers in this film, which has been copied for two decades but never equalled or exceeded.   it spawned an entire generation of films, including john wick.  it's visuals, cinematography, and special effects are ahead of its time.  it's fight and action choreography demonstrated that they can have an equal place in blockbuster fillmmaking.  many of the concepts and language infiltrated the social language in ways only topped by the star wars franchise.  this one is to be seen again (and again) and still holds up.   this, unlike the sequels, is a must see.",positive
No Name,5.0,"this film should be called ""keanu reeves asking questions for 2 hours straight."" it is just phenomenal how many questions he asks.  but this isn't important and i think it is primordial for me to do a proper review of this film. it was my first time watching this classic movie and the conclusion i can get from this experience is that this movie came out absolutely in the right time but also in the wrong time. it went out at the right time because it is a revolutionary movie. i never saw a movie before 1999 that had so much style. the slow motions, the fight scenes and also just the main idea of the film were so ahead of their time and i think that is why the movie went out at the perfect moment. on the other hand, i think that the movie could have been a lot better if it was made today and if the points brang previously didn't count because the only negative point of this movie is the crapy cgi which i don't blame because it was made in 1999. but, if it was made today with our technology, it would have been a bomb. that is why i want to see the fourth chapter in theatre, but, before, i need to watch the 2 and 3 which seem bad to me but i want to know what happens.  ps: i like the voice of agent smith so much.",negative
No Name,4.5,"what a masterpiece! the matrix truly is one of the best sci-fi action movies for so many reasons. firstly, the worldbuilding is so interesting, so creative and it raises these philosophical questions about what's real, what your mind sees, believing in yourself and the question of fate and the first two acts do a great job with this aspect, saving the action for the third act. speaking of action, the acting in the movie is outstanding: beautifully filmed and with incredible visual effects, choreography and techniques, taking from a wide variety of inspirations and sources and it creates some of the best action scenes and 3rd acts in cinema. the production design is incredibly with incredible cinematography and i love this green color grading for the movie. the acting is generally fantastic with hugo weaving pulling off an intimidating agent smith, laurence fishburne an incredibly charismatic mentor and keanu reeve's neo with a great character arc about believing in his abilities and just wanting to do the right thing and i love his developed relationship with trinity. cypher as well is also pretty well developed and i like how his beliefs parallel agent smith's belief about the matrix. the matrix is not perfect though. i think the second acts is a bit too exposition heavy and agent smith is sadly mostly forgotten in the 2nd act so the stakes are kind of low and i wish some of the side characters like switch were more developed, trinity doesn't do much in the 2nd act and some of the dialogue is a bit corny but it's an incredibly imaginative, well-written and exciting sci-fi action movie (a)",positive
No Name,5.0,"i just rewatched all three of these movies yesterday so now is the perfect time for me to review them. there is no doubt in my mind that the matrix is one of the greatest films ever made. the cinematography and fight coreography in this film alone inspired and defined the way that action & adventure movies were created for well over a decade. this can't be a proper critic review of the matrix if i don't bring up the notorious bullet-time sequence. while i can obviously admit that a lot of the cgi in this time looks really dated now but there are still plenty of times throughout the film, the bullet-time sequence included that are still visually stunning in their own way to this day over 20 years later. there is also a unique sense of mystery that surrounds this movie, what separates this film from it's two sequels the most is that in this movie you feel like you're a part of neo's journey. it feels like we're slowly learning and adapting to the hidden secrets within the matrix alongside him as the events of the film play out. there is also a deep sense of philosophy to this movie, it may not have been the first movie ever made to present and explore the idea that our whole world is a simulation, but this film is without question the one that did it the best. i also love the idea that real world pain applies to the matrix, once you're in it's not a care-free world where you can do whatever you want with no consequences. if you die in the matrix, you die in the real world. it gives an extra sense of intensity and stakes to the film that probably wouldn't have been there if this reality hadn't been put in place. one of my biggest complaints overall about this first film though is cypher's betrayal. i feel like it comes way too early in the movie, a lot of the characters he kills off barely got enough real screen time for the audience to really know their characters and care about them in some way before they just find themselves electrocuted to death or unplugged from the matrix. i feel like this whole movie would've been better if cypher's betrayal had either been pushed back to the actual climax of the film before neo's fight with agent smith or removed from the film entirely and instead been a major plot point of the beginning of the matrix reloaded so that we could have had the amount of time with these other side characters like tank & dozer to actually feel something when they both die along with 75% of the crew of the nebuchadnezzar. other than that and the fact that the beginning of the movie leading up to neo becoming a part of the matrix feels rushed, it kind of removes some of the mystery from the film overall. besides those tiny complaints i think this movie is phenomenal in every sense of the word and it will always be a solid 10 out of 10 in my book.",negative

No Name,2.5,"massively overrated because of its influence on film and everyone having the hots for keanu reeves despite the fact that he cannot act for his life. 2.5/5 is arguably being generous. the plot was full of holes, the characters were largely unoriginal and underdeveloped, lots of the dialogue was cringeworthy and would never be said in real life, some of the acting was awful, especially from keanu reeves, the film was too long, the gun fights were ridiculous, the costumes/props could have been better, the visual effects are now dated, and there was a horrible green tinge for half the film. the intro sequence was nonsense, it doesn't make sense how there was a ship outside of the matrix, the tech inside the ship was laughable, the emp should've destroyed things in the ship, the robots would have found the ship far earlier, there was no source of food, the character turning against his friends twist failed, the man who should have died after being electrocuted getting back up twist was also predictable, and then the last 1/3 or so devolved into non-stop action. however, the film was original, fishburne put on a good performance, the hand-to-hand combat was entertaining thanks to good choreography, the cinematography was well done and revolutionary, and the soundtrack was appropriate. a 5/5 is a perfect or near perfect film. this is far from perfect.",negative

No Name,5.0,"being a fan of the 1922, 1979, and other interpretations, i viewed nosferatu 2024 hoping that robert eggers would pay appropriate tribute to the story, as well as making this one feel different, and purposeful. what i got was a remake that doesn't try to outdo any of the other films, but pay appropriate tribute to them as well as creating a different experience, one that is eery and technically impressive.  yes, technically it is a gorgeous film, despite it being dreary. it's a world of 1838 before electricity. rooms are dark. crackling fires and candles make up the light. muted colors fill out the palette. camerawork and sound put you in the world of this vampire who can ingrain fear into people. apart from these achievements, the way the story unfolds is risky. it asks the audience to be involved and to understand character motivations (which help if you know the original nosferatu), but also to understand the time setting and how the actors are portraying their characters, which tends to be very theatrical. very much silent film acting.   for many people, it just won't be a film for them. their idea of this film dragging on, is my idea of enjoying the world that was created. their absence of seeing character motivations or visual cues are things that fans of the original movie might understand a bit more. like a silent movie, this sound version still wants the audience to participate with their mind. i will concede that it won't work for everyone, but to me, it was an incredible viewing experience.",positive

No Name,5.0,"hacer una recreaci√≥n de una joya de culto como nosferatu es un tema de discusi√≥n. lo cierto es que la elecci√≥n de robert eggers como director fue la m√°s correcta porque √©l conoc√≠a la pel√≠cula original y porque si el proyecto hubiese estado a cargo de otro director, el resultado final podr√≠a no haber sido tan agradable. cuando werner herzog hizo su versi√≥n de nosferatu, copio varias cosas evidentes de la pel√≠cula de murnau, pero tambi√©n le dio un toque propio y algunas ideas nuevas para que nosferatu (1979) fuera una aceptable recreaci√≥n del cl√°sico de murnau. con la versi√≥n de robert eggers pasa lo mismo, pero llevado a un nivel m√°s alto. aqu√≠ eggers no copia al 100% la pel√≠cula original, pero narra la misma historia con un toque propio y cambios que le dan a esta versi√≥n un argumento m√°s desarrollado y profundo adentramiento al mismo. como es caracter√≠stico del estilo del director, esta pel√≠cula ofrece una visi√≥n bastante sombr√≠a y con un ritmo lleno de bastante tensi√≥n. al igual que the witch y the lighthouse, la direcci√≥n de eggers hace que esta pel√≠cula se sienta como una pesadilla. hay momentos en que la influencia del conde orlock afecta mentalmente a los personajes al punto de que sienten que est√°n atrapados en una pesadilla de la que no pueden despertar. hay momentos en los que parece que la realidad se distorsiona y genera una sensaci√≥n de tensi√≥n en el ambiente. thomas hutter ya se est√° adentrando en una pesadilla y no es hasta que conoce al conde orlok que comienza a sospechas bastante. en la pel√≠cula de murnau, thomas se mostraba esc√©ptico hasta descubrir lo que orlok era realmente. en la versi√≥n de herzog, √©l ya sospechaba del conde al momento de conocerlo y en esta pel√≠cula pasa eso tambi√©n, pero con m√°s intensidad. el control que orlok tiene sobre ellen es bastante perturbador y es manifestado como algo similar a una posesi√≥n demoniaca. el romanticismo que la pel√≠cula ofrece sobre ellen y orlok parece en parte basarse en lo que coppola hizo con dr√°cula, pero la relaci√≥n entre ellos en esta pel√≠cula es mucho m√°s oscura. el conde orlok de bill skarsgard es mucho m√°s sombr√≠o y siniestro que su contraparte original. pasa mayor parte del tiempo en las sombras y eso lo hace ver mucho m√°s misterioso y t√©trico. el vampiro creado por murnau se basaba m√°s en los strigoi que eran vampiros mucho m√°s horripilantes que un vampiro humano com√∫n. en ese momento, le dieron una apariencia m√°s similar a un roedor por su v√≠nculo con la peste bub√≥nica. el conde orlok de esta pel√≠cula sigue el mismo par√°metro, pero con un dise√±o mucho m√°s grotesco y demacrado. aqu√≠ orlok es un vampiro m√°s cadav√©rico y se siente como un aut√©ntico no-muerto que lleva siglos demacr√°ndose. tambi√©n pudieron dar una breve explicaci√≥n de c√≥mo orlok se convirti√≥ en un no-muerto. el maquillaje es excelente y pudieron brindar una macabra versi√≥n del vampiro nosferatu en su m√°ximo esplendor. el bigote fue sacado de la novela de bram stoker, ya que en ese libro la descripci√≥n de dr√°cula incluye un bigote y es un detalle que muy pocas veces se ha usado. aqu√≠ logro pegar junto con la vestimenta que pone en evidencia la antig√ºedad de la criatura. robert eggers logro agregar m√°s desarrollo a los personajes superando lo que murnau y herzog hab√≠an hecho. la √∫nica diferencia ser√≠a orlok que en la versi√≥n de herzog es m√°s humano y melanc√≥lico. as√≠ como herzog ha ofrecido nuevos momentos memorables para sentirse como una pel√≠cula original, robert eggers hace lo mismo. existen muy buenos planos con maravillosa fotograf√≠a, estupendo vestuario, buen dise√±o de producci√≥n y el correcto uso de luz y sombra. hay escenas que recuerdan un poco al estilo de tim burton. la pel√≠cula se convierte en una obra g√≥tica con escenas perturbadoras, es bastante po√©tica y aterradora. robert eggers supo renovar este cl√°sico tan querido y hacer una pel√≠cula que est√° a la altura de la original. al igual que sus predecesoras, esta pel√≠cula est√° destinada a ser un cl√°sico. nosferatu (2024) es una bella pel√≠cula art√≠stica, un cuento g√≥tico que revive el arte del vampirismo en el cine y una digna sucesora de la obra de murnau. una prueba irrefutable de que nosferatu logr√≥ seguir perdurando en el tiempo, a pesar de haber pasado 100 a√±os. mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 10/10.",positive

No Name,1.0,"the scariest part for me was that it almost bored me to death. and that ending... who came up with that? seriously. can't recommend it. which is really sad because i had high hopes for it. don't get me wrong - i loved the original, liked a lot of the pictures but all in all the story was extremly slow and it was very hard for me to stay awake most of the time.. :-(",negative
No Name,1.5,"super boring. they forgot the plot. copy/paste of bram stoker dracula, which was also boring. nice cinematography. dialog seems contrived, and that‚Äôs coming from someone who enjoyed the witch. i think eggers needs to go back to low budget, this felt like an ultra produced nothing burger.",negative

John,5.0,loved the plot and cinematography best vampire movie i think i‚Äôve ever seen,positive
Alexander S,5.0,"second row imax put me in the movie and it was a great telling of the tale. eggers really delivers a sort of descent that relies on rich sensory experiences and no horror gimmicks.  see this in imax, as close as you can stand, so that the image and sound overwhelm.  when count orlock looms above you, youll understand",positive
Brianna,5.0,this was a masterpiece had us hooked through the whole thing,positive
No Name,1.0,it's very rare that we walk out of a movie. we weren't the only ones either. with a stellar cast i'd expecting something really good. it was just a poor hammer house of horror type movie. visuals similar to some of those on the dracula movie with val kilmer. shame really as it had potential,negative
No Name,3.0,very stylish and engaging version of the classic dracula story but rather plodding at times.,positive
Alex,4.0,visually stunning in true robert eggers fashion.  stellar acting performances all around.  it was a little longer than it needed to be but an overall great movie.,positive

Jarell W,3.5,"adequate remake of a film from the 1920s. i am a lover of vampire movies, so the bias probably added an extra star. the tone and atmosphere were outstanding, yet the plot was problematic when focusing on the character thomas hutter (nicolas hoult), who seemed to make the worse decisions imaginable. although i guess his idiocy was necessary to drive the plot forward. overall the movie was worth seeing, but isn‚Äôt something i will revisit often.",positive
No Name,0.5,terrible watch. needs to be rated at least ma15+ for the gore. while the visuals and effects were great they were not met with an ounce of storyline.,negative

No Name,3.5,"another dracula movie? pshaw..... nevermind! upon watching i was actually pleasantly surprised.  this is the only major adaptation that actually does a halfway decent job at recreating the novel. major props for the sets and atmosphere, takes itself a little too seriously in the acting department sometimes but has a satisfying runtime and resolution. i enjoyed dafoe a lot in this.",positive

Jessica,3.5,great movie. i just know a lot of people wouldnt be able to understand it. its filled with social commentary but at the heart is a love story and a womans struggle to feel whole. fantastic acting- the director is incredible.,positive
Kevin K,5.0,"a perfect film in every way. i wish all movies were made this well, with this level of cinematography, acting, and writing.",positive
No Name,4.0,"robert eggers gives us one of the best cinematic horror atmospheres we've seen in a long time  this may not be the definitive version we'll see of nosferatu, but it is the most exciting so far. this is due to robert eggers' signature gothic style and his way of telling the story, with the notion that the vampire is a terrible and terrifying being, without any other characteristic that differentiates him.  this ancient vampire continues to be terrifying, firstly because its director does not romanticize the character, but rather gives him that disturbing and chilling air, and secondly because eggers truly understands that nosferatu does not focus on the supernatural terror of an everlasting creature, but on power. impeccable, malicious, immaculate and destructive power. a film with incredible work (especially its photography), cinematically it is full of references and amazing details.  robert eggers adds a new treasure to his outstanding filmography.",positive
brian h,4.0,"great film, beautifully haunting visuals, touched on so many emotions.",positive

No Name,0.5,"the only thing i liked was the atmosphere and filming quality and  movement of the camera.   it was showing the nosferatu toooooo much, he was speaking none stop,the way he was breathing sometimes became like comedy movies. for us it was more comedy than horror .",positive

James,1.5,"boring, hard to understand some characters, too dark.",negative
No Name,4.5,visually stunning. glad i saw it in theaters,positive
No Name,0.5,i hated this movie. cannot recommend it to anyone. it‚Äôs advertised as a horror movie but there is nothing remotely scary about this except maybe the oversexualisation of the women in this movie. honestly this felt more like a porn film than a horror movie. i see what they were trying to do with the creepy and sensual vibes but they just did not execute it well at all. everytime something happens to the female characters in this movie their breasts are out and instead of screaming in pain they‚Äôre moaning in a sensual manner. i have a lot more to say about this movie it was just so bad. however if you go into watching this thinking of it as a comedy it might be a little more bearable to watch.,negative
Thomas,4.5,great special effects,positive

Omarr M,4.0,"highy atmospheric, well acted, spectacle, that brings new life to a classic tale.  spectacular cinematography.",positive
No Name,1.0,"the plot moves at an unbearably slow pace, and any scary or suspenseful moments are over almost as soon as they begin, leaving no time for real tension to build. the constant, abrupt scene changes make it hard to stay engaged, and the overall experience feels disjointed. while it has some iconic visuals, the lack of flow and weak pacing made it a chore to watch. i found myself struggling to stay awake. this one might only appeal to film history buffs.",negative
No Name,3.0,"it looks great, has plenty of atmosphere and doesn't drag and i enjoyed simon mcburney and eileen dafoe's performances. but i thought orlok was ridiculously ott as a monster which meant i found him humourous rather than scary, and felt rather sorry for atj who was poor in a thankless and fairly pointless role.",positive

No Name,3.0,"tries to be supremely sinister and tragic and doesn't quite manage it. lovely acting, nice scenery and tone but it doesn't come together. too many elements murk it up. borrows extensively from the gary oldman one. seems like it's going to be clever and a bit weird, but is just a big movie dressed up in gothic tones.",negative
No Name,5.0,"a spectacularly well-made film that i wanted to see again right away after leaving the cinema because i was so distracted by the beauty of each and every shot, i find it difficult to recall the core content and any one particular part of the film.  this film could easily be edited as a silent movie as the soundtrack is also absolute perfection.  the acting has been criticized but i honestly believe there was a need for overacting due to the ambiance and as a further homage to the original film, no single actor stole the show as the star of this film is the film itself. incredible set design and costumes, i can almost guarantee that this film will win at least two oscars, maybe it'll end up with five or six.",positive
PortRow,3.0,"very stylish and the acting is very good, if occasionally a little over the top. the dialogue that count orlok has is overly florid (its a choice to emphasize his being from another time but it bordered on reading silly (he speaks romanian with subtitles) and the direction tends to telegraph when you are going to be jump-scared‚Äîand almost all of the horror is the show build up to a jump-scare or occasionally some gore. im glad i saw it but doubt i will be watching it when its streaming or on tv.",positive

No Name,1.0,"i really, really wanted to like this film. i love the original and everything to do with dracula, and i'm a huge fan of gothic cinema, but this movie was a huge disappointment for me. some of the acting was very nicely done, and i can appreciate the atmosphere and the cinematography. and in fact, the first 30 minutes had me believing that it was going to be a fantastic movie. however, the longer it went on, the more the plot got extremely murky. the audience in my theater laughed several times at points that were clearly not meant to be funny, and there were so many plot holes. i also found myself really confused and disheartened by what their thesis wanted to be. it seemed like they wanted to say something about sexual assault, but didn't have a clear point. the fact that she ""sacrifices herself"" at the end made me wonder if they knew what message they wanted to get across at all, or if they only wanted to show the bleakness of a woman being assaulted multiple times just for the sake of it. i would say that i would rewatch it to try to figure it out, but i don't think i could subject myself to that again. and not to mention the horrible mustache. he looked like waluigi. bad all around. its only saving grace was willem dafoe. without him and his performance, i might even call it unwatchable. i had to rewatch the 1930s dracula when i got home just to cleanse my pallet.",negative

Justin,4.0,"having never seen the original silent movie, i didn‚Äôt know what to think going into this movie. the movie is basically a retelling of the novel ‚Äúdracula‚Äù by bram stoker. for the most part the movie stays true to the source material, while changing a couple things to make it stand on its own. while not terrifying, it‚Äôs definitely grotesque & interesting enough to keep you glued to the screen. i appreciate that you don‚Äôt really see the main antagonist count orlok (the vampire). the actors did such a great job especially willem defoe who always shines in whatever role he plays. the one down side i would point out is sometimes the lore is a little hard to follow towards the end. one instance was how they explained how the vampire curse actually works. other than that this is a solid movie that would recommend seeing in theaters over waiting for it to hit streaming platforms.",negative

No Name,3.0,"truthfully, it was beautiful in terms of cinematic achievement. the script was similar to that of the original, by that, i mean the scenes and what occurred since the original was silent film. with that being said, it was slow and a bit boring. it was in no means scary as they rave it to be. it was a tad bit creepy and possibly disturbing. the acting was phenomenal, especially bill as orlok. his transformation was unbelievable. lily did a wonderful job as well even though people are making fun of her ‚Äúpossessed‚Äù style of acting where it just looks as if she is gyrating in the style of a seizure. if you want to watch it, go in to it knowing it has the writing style of an old victorian style film. it can be boring to those that don‚Äôt appreciate this style.",positive

Dave,4.0,"enjoyed the classic horror and suspense.  it was not gory, but the effects and makeup were astounding.  the wardrobe was beautifully done and i normally don't care about that.  the actors were uterly convincing.  i would have rated it higher but in a nearly empty cinema a guy came in late fell asleep and snored.  had to wake him up several times.",negative
No Name,4.5,"compared to the 1922 and 1979 versions, eggers' version of nosferatu is scarier and sexier. arguably the best portrayal of nosferatu as an undead beast, filled with beautiful yet grim shots that linger throughout the entire film.",positive
Joshua L,4.0,"thought provoking film making . i have it 4 stars as its not a film i can invite everyone to see necessarily . i love how gothic and dark the mood is . the primal /sexual tension and expression of emotions is powerful in this film . i neve watched the original nosferatu , so i was pleased with this films take on the vampires strengths and weaknesses .",positive

No Name,1.0,"sorry, i simply cannot comprehend all the positive reviews and a tomato rating of 85%?!!!  try to imagine a film worse than nosferatu.  spoiler alert:  you can‚Äôt!  this is one of the most poorly written, cliche-laden films i have ever seen. it also features several hilarious way over the top performances where actors appear to fake eye rolling seizures *so*ludicrously hammy that people in the audience erupted in laughter several times  (one person even threw paper at the screen!).  the dialogue seems like it was written by 9th - 11th graders with gems like ""a force worse than evil!"" ""you're a villain"" and tons of manic, panicked characters running around literally jumping ""to and fro"" yelling ""he's coming! he's coming!""  truly one of the slowest-moving, most dull plodding films i have ever seen. one can't help but feel bad for the actors.   this film adds nothing new to the canon (other than a vampire that looks vaguely like a carpathian version of ‚Äúfrank zappa‚Äù.)  save your money and see any one of the countless better versions of this same story, which most adults have probably already seen at least 7 times. oh...and it just kind of ""ends""! (not that you‚Äôre even paying attention at the end, but just sayin')  you‚Äôll laugh out loud, but sadly, this is not a comedy.",negative
No Name,4.0,"it's a classic horror film set in the 18th century.   hats off to robert eggers and the crew; they did a marvellous job with the production.   while the film runs for a little over two hours, which is quite long, a 1 hour 30 minute film would have been more enjoyable.  i highly recommend horror fans watch it on the big screen.",positive
No Name,5.0,"this was almost or is a masterpiece. the acting, lighting everything was done soooo well! minus the time traveling/instant transmission i habe no complaints. i wanna watch this again to relive the amazing acting! this is a must watch!",positive
No Name,5.0,"the type of movie you enjoy if you appreciate victorian era horror, detailed research of historical accuracy, theatrical acting, and thematic horror rather than jump scares. a wonderful adaptation of the classic vampire story taking the creature back to its folklore roots. robert eggers creates yet another horror masterpiece. if you write a review about bram stokers dracula from francis ford coppola being better than this while citing bad acting as the reason, you need to rewatch and pay closer attention to keanu reeves. every performance in this movie is better than his performance in that movie and i‚Äôm a reeves fan!",positive
Brandon E,4.0,"despite a long runtime and some pacing issues, nosferatu is a rich, rewarding horror movie that honors the original film and builds upon that foundation. as expected, eggers builds an immersive experience for us, and i was impressed by the set design, costume design, and atmosphere throughout the movie. the cast was wonderful and there are some genuinely horrifying moments that were jarring and sudden which was an aspect i really loved about the witch. skarsg√•rd and dafoe were both brilliant. recommended",positive
Brian L,1.0,"the storyline was slow, plodding , and poor.  i thought for the level of actors that they had the acting was actually very deliberate, unimaginative, and inadequate. this is the first movie in over decades of movie watching that i have ever walked out on.",negative
No Name,2.0,"as soon as i found out about the release of this film, i was expecting something better. overall, the film is not bad, but i would not recommend watching it and would rather recommend the 1922 film. what i didn't like:  1. there are a lot of sex scenes and naked bodies, which in general are not needed for this film, i can only single out the scene at the end as a ‚Äúritual‚Äù, but basically this is not needed for the film.2. not really a minus, but something that i personally don‚Äôt like, it‚Äôs like i watched a big theater show, there‚Äôs no feeling of being in a movie, the actors played well, but it‚Äôs a theater and not a movie3. there are scenes that are worse than in the 1922 film. perhaps you may consider me wrong in terms of the fact that i compare the original film and this one, but it‚Äôs worth looking at it from the other side, why do i think the 1922 film is better? it's worth thinking about. i won't say specific scenes because it will be too long, but they are there.  finally, i want to say that this film upset me, i wanted to watch a terrifying film that conveys the spirit of nosferatu, but i watched something else, it could have been better.",negative
No Name,3.0,"the visuals and acting were great, but the plot was so similar to dracula without being dracula it made it feel predictable, and you didn't really feel like these characters were real people save for the one guy you're apparently supposed to dislike, because the story doesn't flesh them out beyond their architype",negative
MICHAEL H,1.0,overacting.  sex scenes were unnecessary and in bad taste.  i had hoped for a classic horror story.  instead of scary it was laughable.  a great cast and  filmed well but poorly executed.  what a shame.,negative

No Name,2.0,"excellent cinematography and solid performances from most of the actors. unfortunately not an original take on an old tale and there was a lack of depth to the whole thing,. i think i would have enjoyed it nore if it were less long, but an hour in i found myself bored and looking at my watch.",negative
Ryan Garrison,2.0,way too long. and is missing the best parts of the bram stokers novel.,negative
No Name,3.5,"the visuals were stunning. the sound effects kept you at the edge of your seat. orlock's breathing, the way he spoke, the poetic dialogue set the mood perfectly.  the ending however wasn't my favorite. just because i don't find it believable that orlock could be so dumb after having been a vampire so long.",negative
Montie B,2.0,very few redeeming qualities other than the cast was great but the movie failed to live up to bram stokers dracula although it most likely was never intended to.  it loosely follows bram stokers dracula and once you watch it about the only thing you come away with is understanding why the original was banned for copyright infringement.  the story was similar but the names were changed to protect those guilty of a bad knockoff.,negative
Wyatt,4.0,"amazing cinematography and shots, a great story, loved how the characters spoke like they were in the 1800s. loved the sets, nosferatu was great, dafoe was great, superb acting all around. leaves a little to be desired but still is overall a breath of fresh air and terrific",positive

No Name,1.5,the first 45mins of the movie had me invested. lily depps 70th seizure had me check out early. anticlimactic ending and super awkward and forced sex scenes. the entire theatre giggled everytime ellen started convulsing. wait for it to hit netflix dont waste your money.,negative
No Name,0.5,the film is a bad remake of dracula. if u know the drac story: u will see it here again. they only changed the names of the characters: but it's the exact same drac story step by tedious step.   i was planning on walking out before the middle of the movie: but i was invited...would have been rude.   i can't recommend it to no one knowing it's a knockoff of the original story.  the original 1922 film was really scary.   but this one: 5 thumbs down üëé,negative

No Name,5.0,"a lot of people might not like this movie because they are used to comic book movies with a lot of action and little thinking. but nosferatu is an amazing film that made me think for a few days about how well the film was shot, the great plot and acting. nosferatu's voice is legendary. i am going to see it again this week.",positive
Galilea,4.0,acting was great but predictable.,positive
No Name,5.0,masterfully shot and stays true to the spirit of the source material that inspired it. i have seen some complaints that it is slow. but in truth this is not meant to be an edge of your seat horror thriller but in many ways it is more a gothic romance with horror elements. the pacing while probably somewhat jarring to some modern audiences is well within the theme of the original film and honors it while also adding its own unique elements. i expect this films stature to rise in the coming years.,positive
babyness L,5.0,excellent! lily‚Äôs performance was amazing along with the rest of the cast. loved the ending but sad.,positive

Max Bryant,3.0,"great looking visuals and each cast member was very good.. the movie was okay bordering good in many parts. the story was slow in spots and had several moments of me questioning how ""that"" could possibly of  happened.. if you are a fan of the original and even lugosi's dracula you should see it. then make your.own comparisons and opinions.",positive

Lolani F,4.5,"very much enjoyed it.  yes, it is a ‚Äúslow‚Äù start, but it made sense to me. the first act sets up just what count olag/nosferatu is capable of, and i felt a slowly growing sense of dread and intensity the whole film through. will definitely watch again once it‚Äôs out on disc.",positive
No Name,2.5,"it is a movie that adds to the original movie from 1922. however, some points stands: 1.there are too many sexual scene and teases and does add little to nothing to the movie. 2.runtime can be shortened with so much unecessary scenes; people walking and transpiring? 3.motif? coherence? mad scientist? all of stereotypes of movies are present.  i expect better story telling after a 100 years. you should not just add more scenes and details, but also give meaning to them.",negative

Richard D,0.5,redundant. so dark you cant see anything. disjointed. terrible film,negative
No Name,0.5,"nosferatu (2024) misses the mark by leaning heavily into shock value. both versions are great at world building and atmosphere but the poorly written script and outdated themes overwhelmed any positives.  movies or scenes that include sexual violence tropes that aren‚Äôt necessary, are boring at this point. it‚Äôs a tired, cliched tactic and this movie offers no new insight and relies far too much on trying to make the audience uncomfortable then making those scenes relevant.  the necrophilia scene, in my opinion, was a disgusting addition to the story. i understand vampires are the undead and there are many themes of sex and lust within vampire stories but anna wasn‚Äôt a vampire - she was just a dead woman. in the room with their two dead children. bleak.  you can‚Äôt give consent when you‚Äôre being threatened. it‚Äôs no longer consent at that point. so for everyone saying ellen consented at the end by saying the words ‚Äúi consent‚Äù - literally he was threatening to kill everyone in the town if she didn‚Äôt have sex with him and she decided to sacrifice herself (that doesn‚Äôt equal consent).  the film‚Äôs pacing drags, the tension never truly builds, and the result is a drawn-out experience doesn‚Äôt offer any new insight to an old, over-used trope.",negative
No Name,0.5,"this movie was photographed well but it's boring, overlong and the editing is so disjointed that you'll lose interest. i've seen the other versions of nosferatu and they stand up well over time. you will note that most critics are raving about the cinematography, really ?  its dark for no real purpose. most movies based upon this theme are really like westerns, hero vs villain's, showdowns, carriage chases at midnight or sun up, innocent damsel in distress waiting for dudley do right ! even the old hammer films got it right!  coppola's dracula was one of the  best i ever saw and this movie isn't in the same ball park. frank langella's was the epitome of cool up to that point. save your money the advertisements are fake news ! :-)",negative
No Name,1.0,one star for the production value. the story is what matters most and without drawing from memories of earlier versions it does not hold up on its own. it has terrible writing and characters we don‚Äôt care about. it was actually stupid. it makes coppola‚Äôs look like even more of a masterpiece.,positive

Steve B,5.0,"this movie has an unsettling feeling throughout. its a fresh inspired by but not a copy of dracula.  great production design and makeup. it also has some very intense moments. just when you think the movie is moving a little slow something happens that makes you realize its not slow, its perfectly paced. the rats and what came with them (not spoiling) was a clever backdrop. as a seasoned movie goer its hard to scare me but this movie pulled it off, and its just creepy.",positive

No Name,0.5,"i think this is the second worst movie i've ever seen - better than human centipede 2, and slightly worse than the original.   the plot was boring and you have to try and figure out what's happening. the pace was very slow, and the visuals were way too dark. the characters weren't very developed, which is even worse when so much time is wasted.",negative
No Name,0.5,the main actress did a subpar acting job. they made dracula look like it was the corpse of joseph stalin it was a huge let down not scary at all and laughable if you want to watch a nosferatu then watch the 1922 version it is actually gives you the chills and nightmares and all this done with no sound the 1922 version is not a talkie that version would get five stars this version if i could give it a quarter i would!,negative

Jani Na a was,4.0,great cinematography!,positive
No Name,2.5,i loved the cinematography of the film but nosferatu is let down by being far too hammy and by playing it's plot cards far too early. the film lacks an emotional core and despite it's feminine credentials ultimately wants to have it's proverbial neck and eat it. disappointing but it does look great.,negative

Meccassault,3.0,"the cinematography, acting, and film score are all solid. the pace of the film was a bit drawn out in almost every scene, which sometimes works to its advantage and, at other times, not at all. it's worth a once over, especially if you prefer legitimate vampire films. but, more could've happened throughout with a better pace. it's definitely not a ""scary"" film, so if you go in expecting that, you'll be disappointed. there are, however, a few very intense moments i liked.",positive
No Name,1.0,"sorry, but this emporer has no clothes. this is a long, ponderous, overly self important and boring film. if not with friends i would have walked. yes it is well done, and has lovely production values and homage to the original blah blah.   but there is nothing frightening, the characters are bland and wholly predictable, it needs a proper edit as it is way too long, and i was just wanting the vampire to get it over with and kill everyone so i could go home. there is no suspense.   interesting themes such as the nature of evil and the intersection of sexuality and sin are squandered by heavy handed acting and direction.   our audience laughed out loud at scenes that were clearly not meant to be comedic, it was all so heavy handed.   not to mention the practical plot holes big enough by to drive a hearse through.   will get oscar for best acting by pigeons and rats......  good luck with it. go in with low expectations and you will have a passable time. go in believing the critics and you will be disappointed.",negative
Jose Arrocha,5.0,great movie. fantastic visuals and performances. dafoe stands out just as much as skarsgard‚Äôs title character. hoult continues to be a brilliant risk taker. able to blend his talents into the different tones of a genre like in this and renfield. some of the best use of a vampires abilities and limitations in cinematic history are displayed.,positive

No Name,0.5,"nosferatu is an absolute disgrace to the horror genre. it doesn‚Äôt even hold a candle to the chilling original‚Äîit‚Äôs just plain gross. and not in the way you might expect from a horror film, where tension or gore create a sense of unease; no, this film‚Äôs vulgarity overwhelms everything that could have made it redeemable. while the costume and set are remarkable, the movie itself feels less like a terrifying exploration of the supernatural and more like a poorly executed, borderline soft-core porno. the atmosphere, instead of invoking dread or suspense, drips with uncomfortable and unrelenting crassness. if you were hoping for a compelling vampire tale, you're in the wrong place. nosferatu isn‚Äôt just a disappointment‚Äîit's a grotesque spectacle that seems more intent on being a soft-core porno, than providing any genuine horror.",negative
Alucard,5.0,a nice nod to the past with a subtle touch to effects so the mind does the heavy lifting.,positive
No Name,1.5,it‚Äôs a horror movie but at no point did i feel scared or feel any tangible threat. it was like an action movie. made no sense. it was in english but characters were vocalised as frau or herr. the pace was concertinaed. great photography and sound but the script and direction was awful tbh. the 1922 version is so much better. pointless film in my humble opinion. so many other versions of dracula have been done so well.,negative

""nosferatu"" is a masterful ghotic tale in command of the major elements in horror: an exceptionally unsettling atmosphere, a terrifying monster, and stunning visuals. the movie exceeds the expectations in ressurecting the most iconic vampire in cinema, a remarkable achievement considering the inevitability of comparing this production with the original from 1922. an outstanding addition to the horror hall of fame!",positive
Neyland,3.0,passed the time. was a unique and good story but the movie didn‚Äôt feel scary or suspenseful. felt like i was watching a drama with jim carrey from sonic as the bad guy. wasn‚Äôt scary.,negative
No Name,5.0,"robert eggers' nosferatu is an arresting reimagining of f.w. murnau‚Äôs 1922 masterpiece, blending gothic horror with eggers' meticulous commitment to historical authenticity and atmosphere. the film is a triumph of art direction, with every frame meticulously composed to evoke the haunting beauty and existential dread of its source material. from the claustrophobic cobblestone streets to the eerie glow of moonlit castles, eggers' world feels alive, pulsating with both menace and melancholic beauty.  eggers has crafted what can only be described as the definitive vampire film of the 21st century, transcending genre conventions to explore deeper themes of desire, corruption, and the eternal battle between light and darkness. the film's atmosphere is oppressive yet captivating, weaving a spell that lingers long after the credits roll. in a landscape dominated by disposable genre fare, nosferatu stands as a testament to the enduring power of cinema to reawaken the myths that haunt us, delivering not just a film, but a macabre symphony of shadow and light that cements its place as a modern classic.",positive
Rodney B,3.5,"'nosferatu' is a horror movie that is equal parts creepy, gory, disturbing and frightening.  it is beautifully shot and directed but for me falls short of being great because i didn't connect or relate to any of the characters.  that may be by design but it left me with a hollow feeling.   like a meal that looks better than it tastes.",negative
No Name,4.5,one of my all time favorite vampire type movies.,negative

Jake,3.0,"nosferatu is undeniably impressive from a production standpoint. director robert eggers gets the most out of his cast and crew to transport audiences to a distinct time period. on a story level, however, the film is lacking the sophisticated edge that helped make the classic dracula adaptations mesmerizing in a terrifying sort of way. this is especially true in the one-note presentation of  the titular count, whose characterization is void of the academic humanity that gave more depth to prior portrayals. nonetheless, it is an entertaining watch.",positive
No Name,5.0,"i watched it at the cinema. the film draws the viewer into the film, making the viewer live the dark experience of the scenarios developed. i left the cinema scared of my own shadow. so that means the film is excellent.",positive
Debra C,3.5,"atmospheric and dark. we know the story, of course, but that didnt tamp down the anticipation of the ending. i dont know why they cast skaarsgard because he was unrecognizable and the character had no real personality. the star, as is always the case with eggers, is the art direction and creation of a whole world of building dread. gave me nightmares all night after.",negative
No Name,5.0,"not for the modern adhd rattled brain.  this is a slower paced masterpiece.  sensational acting, cinematography and a story that ties up with a great ending.  the special effects are on point.   a great remake.  this one should attract an academy award nomination.",positive

No Name,1.5,"very slow and plodding. the plot points are unsurprising and rote for much of the movie and the characters are flat. the scares are pretty unsurprising and ineffective. the vampire is pretty much just a random monster with no real characterization who talks far too slowly (and breathes too loudly, like all the time.) i get that the sex scenes are meant to be transgressive, but they're often abrupt and/or add little of value. the final scene is cinematically interesting, but still, to sum it up, the female character's only worth appears to be her ability to sex the monster to death.  overall, boring and rehashed. the only thing they changed from every other dracula movie was making the sexuality overt instead of implicit.",negative

No Name,4.0,"very scary and unnerving, beautifully shot and directed, terrific acting and production design all come up in this great gothic picture, which sometimes lets it down as it does not know if it wants to be a remake of the 1922 movie or just another adaptation of dracula, which creates a very confusing tone.",negative

No Name,1.0,"nosferatu was kinda pretty. that is all.  no, i mean, that's really is all it was.  a dull regurgitation of a story told better a thousand times prior, draped in some vaguely interesting cinematography, and a count orlock with more of a throat cold than a character. i am baffled why critics and audience speak highly of it.",negative

No Name,5.0,i came out of the cinema with this excitement i haven't had since childhood. absolutely loved it.  it adds so much depth to the original story but it's still amazing on it's own and you can tell the director did its homework with all the details and meanings behind every decision.  by far my favorite film i've seen in years <3,positive

No Name,3.5,"true to his own style, robert eggers develops a solid film where suspense dominates terror. without a doubt, the highlight of nosferatu is the photography and the scenery, which help build the horrific path that we travel as viewers. however, towards the middle of the film it starts to get boring and makes it difficult to follow the plot without getting lost. as a final point to consider, despite the more than 70 prostheses used to create the character of count orlok, the film lacks large shots that honor and show this great work in great detail, leaving a somewhat bitter taste. to sum up, nosferatu is totally worth it with a few strong points that will keep you enthralled for much of the plot, but at the same time it is a particular and more psychological style of cinema that can cause you to lose attention towards the end of the film.",positive

No Name,5.0,"a horror movie for the pure of horror heart. the many references to previous tellings of the classic monster do not detract, but rather form a new context where they unify the story. all character names are new here, but we know who they are. we don't know the secret of the grotesque gouhl's undoing or if it is possible until the horrific final scene, but we do feel for the characters grieving the terrifying carnage of an unrelenting beast. the intensity is a lot to bear for most audiences, but the cinematography, sets, costumes and dialog create a plausible world in which a vampire might emerge.",positive

No Name,5.0,"i found this movie excellent, both the story and the characters, the gothic atmosphere, so dark, the character of count orlok seemed sinister to me, i can say that it scared me a lot, but what i didn't like about this movie are the screamers, since in today's horror movies nowadays it's very repetitive but i loved it in the end",positive
No Name,3.0,"nosferatu is a beautiful film with stunning cinematography. the performances were strong across the board. that said, nicholas hoult truly stood out with his fantastic portrayal. the makeup design, costumes, and quirky elements were all exceptional.  however, at times, it watched like the cast was divided between two different films‚Äîa serious period drama/tragic gothic romance‚Äîwhile also leaning into the absurdity of a wacky episode of family guy. i also believe the film could have benefited from trimming about 30 minutes; i don‚Äôt think we would have missed anything significant, as there was quite a bit scenery chewing throughout.",negative
No Name,0.5,"it's just some cheap demon porno. they're just trying to make money off of showing you a ton of twisted demonsex. that's it. it's like they sat in a boardroom somewhere and thought ""we need an edgy angle for our movie that hasn't been done before"" and someone said ""let's really pump up the demon sexuality and throw it in everyone's face"". whatever. welcome to capitalism. it was a bad movie though on top of being really cringeworthy with it's attempted demonsex edginess. and nicholas holt is one of my least favorite actors ever",negative

No Name,5.0,"a character deconstruction of addiction done altman style that is also an all time classic. one of the first things you notice is the creative tour de france of editing techniques. while this is jumpy with no one characer dominating the others, it never feels unfocused, bloated, meandering, or obnoxious with more style than substance. in fact it's got both. the editing really compliments the pacing perfectly and compensates for so many different storylines. it's a very rare case where the editing really makes this work. it uses music video techniques but unlike a lot of others around this time that try that, it doesn't feel dated at all. it comes off as surreal more than anything and really fits with the subject matter. the acting is first rate and really builds as this progresses to the climatic consequences of all the characters actions. ellen burstyn is amazing and is the best of all fo them. even though her story is arguably the most isolated of all four it's not any less fasinating and a real testament to ehr acting ability. it's brutal to watch and fasinating. shot in a masterfully surreal way that again never feels showy but really amplifies the dazed and confused atmosphere of the subject matter. it's like a comprehensive apocalypse now for drug addiction on all sides of the trade. everyone who has a strong stomach should give this a try once. if your familiar with the director than it helps going in knowing if you can handle it.",positive

No Name,4.0,"darren aronofsky's requiem for a dream is a harrowing look at addiction and obsession.  sara goldfarb's (ellen burstyn) universe exists primarily within her brooklyn apartment where, fueled by amphetamines, she obsesses about appearing on television.  meanwhile, her son harry (jared leto), accompanied by his girlfriend (jennifer connelly) and his best friend (marlon wayans), spend their days looking to score their next fix of heroin.  it is a nightmarish vision from the start as the characters slowly but inevitably descend into a world of horrifying physical and mental pain, psychosis, surreal hallucinations, and the reality that there is no escape.  while aronofsky's outlandish style is sometimes unnecessarily distracting, the movie is buoyed by some stark and memorable imagery, a remarkable score by aronofsky regular clint mansell, and what could just be burstyn's career-defining performance.",positive

No Name,3.5,"""requiem for a dream"" is an american psychological drama film directed by darren aronofsky in 2000. it is adapted from hubert selby jr. in 1978. the film describes four characters affected by drug addiction and how it changes their physical and emotional states. their addiction makes them imprisoned in a world of fantasy and despair. as the movie develops, each character will deteriorate and their reality will be replaced by fantasy, leading to disaster. ""requiem for a dream"" is a movie of four americans who have fallen from power. they have no bright future but resort to stimulants. when sara hoped to find a way out of chemical happiness, for her son harry, his girlfriend marian and friend tyrone, she also got used too the pills and even mother sara goldfarb fell into a downward spiral. at the beginning of the film, she still tried to guide the child on the right path by tying the tv he wanted to sell to the radiator, but when a rogue nutritionist confessed to a somewhat neurotic sixty-year-old that she might lose weight, because of the pills she didn't want to stop taking them and got addicted. the movie focuses on the lives of the residents of coney island, and the film shows the consequences of addiction and obsession and how obsession leads to addiction. by playing with different camera angles and the smooth editing work, a special film experience is created. just like the audience has experienced the pain of various characters.  jared leto convincingly plays the role of drug addict harry goldfarb, and he will do his best to get the last batch of heroin. but money is a problem. he has no choice but to force his addict girlfriend marion into prostitution, and the latter is a brilliant role played by jennifer connelly. his good friend tyrone, played by marlon wayans, also tried to control his addiction, but his efforts were in vain. when friends were struggling with addiction, harry's mother sara was glued to the tube when she called for contestants on her favorite tv show. she is determined to participate, but needs to lose a few pounds to wear her favorite clothes. her obsession with television made her addicted to drugs that can speed up the weight loss process. but the result was disastrous, and sara slowly and surely seemed to lose control of reality. the exorcist actress ellen burstyn played a very good role. ""requiem for a dream'' is a drama film that makes you think, but also gives you a bad feeling. the film clearly shows how strong an addiction can be. but also how strong an obsession can be and that this can lead to rash choices with disastrous consequences. requiem for a dream is, for me, the example of a good film that i never need to see again. it made me quite depressed. with this masterpiece, he impressed me as a viewer.",negative

No Name,4.5,"this is darren aronofsky's 2nd movie. so it made sense for him to tackle a subject like this one near the new millennium. it's his trippy spiral into drug addiction.  jennifer connelly, keith david, a young jared leto, and i forgot marlon wayans was in this. 3 characters; a young couple and an elderly woman begin to feel the rush but also the downside of taking these supplements.  20 years later and it's still a highly styled product of its era, its hopped-up editing schemes and plethora of lens choices and gimmicks a glossy refinement of 90s indie aesthetics and tarantino-patented extremity. might not be everyone's taste but it's a creative example of a filmmakers vision. the 1978 novel was grimly forensic in detailing the physical and mental destruction wrought by drug addiction.  the movie also has one of the most memorable scores ever. wonderful performances and such bleak imagery are impressive. good cutting edge indie filmmaking with its split screen style and extreme closeups.  it says we're all vulnerable to some manner of addiction, and legal ones aren't necessarily safer or less ruinous than their underworld counterparts. the movie vividly evokes the sensation of what drugs actually do to your system, briefly for better and mostly for worse, from twitchy initial rush through to comedown and tortured aftermath. it all boils down to just saying no. aronofsky pushes his limits with this plot and it's probably a good thing he did setting the bar for future storytellers.",positive

No Name,4.0,"this is what you get when very talented people decide to do a semi-realistic picture of the worst possible outcome for every character in the movie. william shakespeare's review of this film would probably read, ""now that's what i call a tragedy! everyone we care about either dies or faces a horrible future!"" what makes this movie special is love. we, the audience grow to love these characters. they are presented to us as good people. they love each other. there's not a 'bad' person in the crowd. if ellen burstyn was your apartment neighbor you would be glad to say hi to her when you saw her in the hall. the teenage protagonist loves his mother and just wants a great life for her. for himself, for his friend, and for his pretty girlfriend. everybody just loves everybody else!  if they  were selfish arses or just dealing drugs for money, you could think to yourself, ""well, they got what they deserved!""  but the film's characters didn't get what they deserve. they got worse than they deserve. should your life be ruined forever just for wanting some fun out of life? the mother just wants to be on tv so she can be ""somebody special"" to her friends. otherwise, without a man, or other interests, she has nothing to live for or look forward to. i believe that all of us know that life just ain't supposed to be like that. the penalty for stepping over the line shouldn't be what all of these characters get. i can't stop watching this movie. but i have to tell you that i look away from the screen in some parts. i am silently shouting at the screen, ""no! no! that person does not deserve that! have mercy on them!"" but in this movie, the quality of mercy is strained.",negative

No Name,4.0,"burstyn is an absolute tour de force in this film, what a transformative performance. every cast member does a strong turn, but she is the unparalleled standout, accompanied by a major surprise in the form of an unexpectedly good performance from wayans (who i was unaware had performed in any serious dramas at all). the film's notorious intensity was definitely a driving factor preventing me from seeing this film at some point in the previous two decades, but now having seen it i would describe the film more as exceptionally uncomfortable than unpalatable, gradually building up pressure before ultimately allowing the pot to boil over (characteristic of aronofsky). the film's take on psychological surrealism and induced delusion is great; parents, don't rely on mcgruff the crime dog to tell your kids not to do drugs, just show them requiem for a dream. (4/5)",positive
No Name,5.0,"requiem for a dream is written and directed by darren aronofsky based on the book with the same name written by hurbert shelby jr. this film is the story about 4 individual lives and their addictions. one of them played by ellen burstyn gets addicted to diet pills when she is invited on a game show and must slim down in order to fit into a dress she so desperately wants to wear and also to look good. her son played by jared leto who is addicted to a lot of things mainly heroine starts up a business with his girlfriend played by jennifer connelly and his best friend played by marlon wayans where they get drugs and sell it to make profit. and as the year for each individual drug induced person goes on things start getting worse and worse as the drugs take over their health and life.   requiem for a dream is one of those films that will never escape me and for whoever watches the film i guarantee that it won't leave the mind as well. through this entire runtime my eyes were glued to the screen for beginning, middle and end. once in a while i'd think to myself man i am really invested in this film. this film garners your attention and never lets up. which is an aspect that i think people might not like but we'll get to that in a little bit. from the incredible pacing i was on the edge of my seat the entire time and never found myself attention-less. requiem for a dream is an phenomenal piece of cinema that will go down in film history as possibly one if not the nightmarish and disturbing films ever created. and it is by far one of the best films that i have ever seen. now that might seem very daunting because of the subject matter of the film but i don't know. not thinking about that subject matter there's something very intriguing about this film that i can't not stop thinking about.   darren aronofsky has crafted such a unique and creative tale of misery and sadness that in a way just seems so perfect. the way the story is told and how the editing plays a major part of the film from editor jay rabinowitz. including the shots and cinematography from director darren aronofsky and cinematography matthew libatique giving the atmosphere of the film its claustrophobic and disturbing experience. from the nightmarish scenes involving their hallucinations to the drugs they take to moments of consequences they have to endear. also trying not to forget to mention but the fantastic and nerve racking score from clint mansell giving the film another bump of adrenaline and absolute menace. this might be my favorite darren aronofsky film ever and to be far i haven't seen all of his films yet but man i don't think with an experience like this one will be beaten by any of his other films to tell the truth. he did an amazing job at directing this including writing this. it's very unpredictable there was even a moment in the film after i was halfway through it that i decided i can't predict anything out of this film which is something that i really enjoy from a film. you also get why they do this, they're not just stereotypical junkies, they have motives and reasons why they do the drugs.   which leave me to the performances from our 4 main characters. right off the bat i'm debating if i like jared leto more in this or in dallas buyers club. he was terrific in this film. jennifer connelly is an actress i'd like to watch more of because man she was also fantastic in this film as the girlfriend of jared leto's character. marlon wayans as jared leto's best friend was also really great in the film which i didn't expect at all but he did really well. but my favorite performance throughout this film was ellen burstyn. out of all of them i felt more for her than anyone. but not to say that i didn't really feel bad for anyone else, i most certainly felt bad for everyone but ellen's performance i felt just more sympathetic for. from the beginning and end you can see the drastic change in her after going to far with the drugs she takes which was just heart breaking. there's also one scene where i just thought this is by far one of the best actress acting scenes i have ever seen ever. she was freaking phenomenal in this film. now for all of them just mentioning it briefly but there is one sequence that had my mouth in ah and could not look away. a sequence that made me realize what an uplifting experience this entire film has been.   coming back to what i mentioned before this film will tear you to pieces with its editing, storytelling and subject matter. also it's aspect of claustrophobia. and i will be fully understandable if this subject matter is something you or anyone else can't handle. i would never recommend watching this film ever if you feel that way about the subject matter. trying not to be super dramatic but it's the truth. darren aronofsky understands the subject matter and throws his own unique spin on it giving it a very disturbing and very sad experience and is also a film and has also been deemed a film that no one should watch on a second viewing and it's the absolute truth. this is no blockbuster you can watch over and over again and be entertained by, this is a grounded dark tale that will already never leave your mind because of how it is. all in all if you can handle this subject matter i'd watch it for the experience and be done with it.  or if you're like me you might really like it but who knows. and another thing worth noting is this film is not trying to promote addiction. this is a film that a wanna be junkie will watch and probably will never want to do drugs ever. that's how terrifying this film is.   requiem for a dream is one of the best and one if not the most disturbing and upsetting film i have ever seen in my life and i gonna give it a 10/10.  thank you so much for reading look forward to more reviews very soon.",positive

No Name,3.0,"the cinematic height of a health problematic film that health classes would present as clearly visualized warning about what would drugs do to you is no exaggeration as darren aronofsky was headstrong in his disturbingly honest approach that guarantees sickness, to a puking extent if never looked away, and apathy for the hopelessly unlikable characters sealing, or in their cases injecting, their fates from resulted downward spiral of addictions that disregard living. even though the characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, pathetically disgusting addictions, the cast performed well in getting through especially the young trio building up their stardom at the time. only one communication found common sense through leto's performance in one scene with words his character should have listened to and additionally become a hypocritical drug addict, which is a brutalized truth that people using drugs are arrogantly ignorant of the dangers posed against their well-beings ‚Äì and that shows how aronofsky should've gone further in communication rather than focusing on the depressing spiral. fairly praiseworthy on the aesthetics through the cinematography and acceptable surrealism despite the discomfort, but how can it be rated into the like if it's not enjoyable? if you ever watch this film, whether nighttime or not, immediately follow it with a more positive film, doesn't matter if it's a good one or a bad one, just to get rid of what your eyes just tasted.

No Name,4.5,"yes, ""requiem for a dream"" is a beautifully made film, and exceedingly well-acted. but in a way, those positively-spun accolades are irrelevant red herrings and tangential false flags. because the core attribute of ""requiem for a dream"" wholly eclipses every other with its pitch-black truth: sometimes, dreams just don't come true. this is the bleakest film ever made, and there are people who should actively avoid it at all costs. it offers razor blades. hopelessness. and the promise that if you subject yourself to watching it, you will know too much.  there are experiential darknesses that leave scars in life, but they're relegated to real-world experiences -- abuse, torture, addiction, death, grief. in film, only the experience of watching ""requiem for a dream"" can mimic in the psyche some of those destructive true life horrors. consuming it can take things away from you.

No Name,5.0,"a daunting nightmare spiral of addiction.  darren aronofsky's mad drug fueled nightmare journeys the audience through the lives of 4 addicts of various substances. it is split into seasons starting with summer, then fall, winter, and ends in spring. i will be completely honest and say that it does have its faults. it can lack the subtlety of more mature films in its dialogue and appearance. however, this film is a collection of sequenced art scenes that are gorgeous in how haunting they become. in the end, you may be traumatized like so many that have viewed this film, but requiem for a dream will leave you thinking and disturbed. i can guarantee that much.  jared leto is a harrowing heroin addict. one of his best acting performances other than dallas buyer's club. he oozes desperation for a fix exponentially throughout the film's duration. jennifer connelly is so sympathetic, you just feel worse and worse for her character for what she does for love, acceptance, and drugs. marlon wayans is more about making his place in the world with money and heroin dealing. you see his sad past lead to a broken future. ellen burstyn is perhaps the most underrated performance in requiem for a dream. her addiction seems to be sugar, then you realize its television. her obsession with watching leads her to ruination.  in short, aronofsky demonizes substance abuse, but takes care in showing the downward spiral of addiction is the most exaggerated, but poignant way he knows. the cinematography will dazzle and terrify you. clint mansell's legendary and now infamous score will haunt you for the rest of your days. darren aronofsky's mad masterpiece is a demonstration of film making with innovative edits, cuts, synchronization, musical swells, and deranged sequencing. nearly every scene is shot differently. it's a very interesting movie to look at in that i doubt you will be bored.  check out darren aronofsky's unhinged film requiem for a dream if you dare. you have been warned.",positive

No Name,3.5,"it's clear that darren aronofsky didn't want to make something new and special in the characters' arcs or the story, but he wanted to put you in the shoes of the characters with his creative use of visuals and sounds, and he succeeded.... kinda!    thanks to aronofsky's direction that harmonized surreal visuals and sounds with the characters' feelings and experiences, i found myself experiencing and feeling what the characters experience and feel while watching the movie. due to that, this is without a doubt one of the most disturbing and intoxicating movies i've ever watched.   the problem is that the dramatic aspect in the movie actually harmed the movie; the dramatic scenes at the end of the first act slowed the pace of the movie down. it's not the only or the major issue i've with this movie. the real issue is that the creative direction that elevated the stereotypical arc of sara goldfarb, wasn't enough to do this with the stereotypical arc of harry and marion. also, the oscar-worthy performance by ellen burstyn (i really wanna know how she didn't win an oscar) and a few complications in her character, sara goldfarb's part was way better and more compelling than harry and marion's. i really didn't found myself relate to the characters of harry and marion so much, despite the great performances that jared leto and jennifer connelly gave. the perfect example that can affirm that the dramatic aspect wasn't the most powerful thing in the movie is the character of tyrone; it's a very bland character and it was very hard for me to relate to its subplot, marlon wayans was very good though.    i love requiem for a dream. it's a movie to experience not to watch. it really proves that darren aronofsky is a real talent that with his artistic direction can easily mess with your mind.

No Name,4.5,"requiem for a dream (2000), directed by darren aronofsky, kind of makes you wonder about the filmmaker's past, and just what spurred him to make a movie as dark and depressing as this. it practically screams ""don't do drugs, kids!"" but it does so in the artsy kind of way that keeps you enthralled and never even approaches the area of preachy. in fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction.   ranging from three of the seasons, summer to fall to ultimately winter, the film represents how the characters' lives get darker and colder with each season that progresses. obviously, summer being the brightest and warmest, and winter being the darkest and coldest.  addiction is a real thing, and throughout the film, you'll see through aronofsky's eyes the kind of effects it can (will) have on you. throw in a beautiful, melancholy score, and you get a touching motion picture that you'll never forget. i can actually hear the lux aeterna melody as i write this, but that's probably because i'm listening to it right now.  requiem for a dream hosts four main characters, ellen burstyn as sara goldfarb, a more serious than normal marlon wayans as tyrone, jennifer connelly as marion, and jared leto as harry goldfarb, who has ties with each of the other three characters (mother, friend, girlfriend). each of them is or will become addicted. and each of them meets different, yet terrible, fates in the end.  ellen burstyn brings the character of sara goldfarb to life so well that it makes me never want to grow old. starting out as a sweet, (if a little kooky) lonely old woman, her quest to become beautiful again for her game show appearance that she can't wait for causes her to become addicted to diet pills, and everything in her life spirals out of control from there.  this film is not for everyone. if you'd rather watch a feel-good movie where the protagonist(s) prevail and everybody is happy in the end, you should probably stay away from requiem for a dream. everyone else - come into this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the ride (if that's the correct phrase) that aronofsky is about to take you through.",negative

No Name,4.5,"oh boy...   oooooooh boy...  requiem for a dream is an exercise in how miserable can you make your audience without making them want to walk out, and it does that, fairly flawlessly. this darren aronofsky tragedy succeeds through strong writing, directing and powerful performances from an ensemble cast.    requiem for a dream follows four manhattan beach characters; the son played by jared leto, (dallas buyers club), his grandmother played by ellen burstyn, (the exorcist, interstellar), his girlfriend played by jennifer connely, (a beautiful mind, blood diamond), and his best friend played by marlon wayans, (white chicks, scary movie). it follows them as they each build up their hopes and dreams, only to have it torn back down again by their own personal addictions. it's like of mice and men on speed, literally, and good.   i pitch this film to everyone as a must see, it's a film you should definitely see once, and then never again! it's based on a book by hubert selby jr. who co-wrote the screenplay with aronofsky, (black swan, the wrestler), a writer famed for his understanding of that sort of low life new york culture and his skill in portraying it, and that really comes through in the film which is scuzzy beyond belief. the dialogue and syntax and slang of the characters really sell them as being in this world, an the grungy lighting, and subtly but meticulously crafted frames help. subtle beauty, maybe ang lee can learn a thing or two.   the reason requiem for a dream works so well is that before it tears them down, it builds up your relationship with the characters, gets you to empathise with them and feel for them and like them, it builds up their hopes and makes their dreams seem wonderfully possible before their falls. in fact that's literally the structure of the film, which is simple but genius, the three acts are denoted by the seasons; summer, fall, and winter. our associations with each word complimenting the acts. this character involvement would't work if it wasn't for a collection of quite outstanding performances. leto's accent is a bit ropey but you get used to it and he does everything else really well. there's one scene with a phone call that i nearly cried watching. i wanted to. wayans gives an uncharacteristically serious performance and he does it really well. when people were wondering why on earth the man behind all these shit parody movies was being invited to join the american academy i remembered requiem for a dream in which he is charismatic and empathetic. the real stand out though, is elen burstyn, who was actually oscar nominated for this movie and boy does she deserve it. by far the most complex character she gives a powerhouse performance in which she is believable but just extraordinarily brittle. again, there's a scene where leto comes to visit that's by far the most memorable scene in the film and again i nearly welled up.   in the end it's moments like those that are the key to understanding the hypnotic, mesmeric, enigmatic attraction of requiem for a dream, it has a lot of bleak imagery, and montages that will leave you traumatised but it's interspersed with moments of pathos and emotional sadness that are much more subtle and give the more traumatic sequences weight that without it would just seem gratuitous, and worse, slightly immature, using these images without any understanding of the weight they carry. however, luckily, aronofsky and selby jr. know exactly what they're doing and they do it well. it's carried off with a style, professionalism and maturity that belies that this is only aronofksy's second film, and first bigger budget one.   also, i have to mention clint mansell's beautiful, melancholy but perversely techno-influenced score, it's truly amazing.",positive

No Name,4.0,"requiem for a dream is maybe one of the most depressing and heart breaking movies in the history of cinema, featuring an old woman,  who starts doing drugs to fight back her addiction to chocolate and sweets and attend her favorite tv show unsuccessfully, whose son is a junkie like his best friend and his girlfriend.   the movie is divided in three parts: -summer, where the characters are introduced, and where aronofsky gives the audience hope about the future of them. the love between harry and marion is particularly exalted, like sara's typical widow's way to live. all the main characters underestimate their addiction to drugs as they reach their top.  -fall, where everything start crumbling. drugs take control over everyone's life.  -winter, aka the saddest part of the movie. not crying is a challenge at this point, as arronofsky great technique to create a link to all the characters makes you feel like you are part of their lives.   the movie is not perfect at all, as it features a really poor character's design, an overall repetitive pacing before the latter part, a sometimes confusing photography, but has a strong and perfect soundtrack (one of the most famous in the world), a great plot and is just so entertaining, you sometimes forget to be seeing a dvd. with trainspotting, this is the best ""don't do drugs"" movie ever, although i wouldn't recommend it to weak people as it may be one of the less enjoyable experience ever.",negative

No Name,4.0,"whilst it borders on becoming a little too 'mtv' (what that means makes sense to me, at least), 'requiem for a dream' has more than enough gusto and originality to get away with its endlessly dark and moody storytelling.  the performances are strong, though no one really stood out- likely because of the majority of the film's subdued nature. however, when it does build up burstyn delivers something memorable and fascinating.   really, it was sara goldfarb's story that kept me engaged and interested here and i think it easily made up for some of the film's weaker points. it would be very easy for a film taking itself this seriously to be nothing but a complete joke and whilst, this possibly comes somewhat close at times, it never actually ends up there and i think that's a credit to aronofsky's direction- this isn't a film trying to be cool, it's just legitimately cool at times. the way he captures frantic addictive tendencies is a real technical achievement and it makes up for some of the script's, quite generic, interpretations of these same concepts.  deserving of its cult status but still just a little too nineties if we're being honest (though i believe it's technically a film of the noughties but, facts are irrelevant).",positive

No Name,5.0,"watching requiem for a dream was an experience with lasting effects. it's the most hopeless film i've seen to date with a completely ruthless portrayal of drug addiction and the horrors associated. this is not as much due to the subject matter, but more so to how the characters' struggles are so sympathetic, and these struggles being presented with such scrutiny by darren aronofsky and the cast that is devastatingly painful to watch.  there is an unwavering sense of disgust from the opening scene, and it never lets up from there, making it the only film that i can confidently say i wanted to squirm in my seat while watching. it is an upsetting film in every sense of the word, made apparent by the emotional performances, the characters' goals in life slowly slipping through their fingers (hence the title) due to their use of drugs, and the uncomfortably close camera angles that give the viewer a cringe-inducing sense of entrapment.   it's easy to think of this film before seeing it and assume it is purely dependent on the significance of the subject matter with no substance from a filmmaking standpoint. however, if the film lacked in filmmaking, it would not be nearly as upsetting. darren aronofsky knows how to trap the viewers into the horrible events with a stellar cast, clint mansell's haunting score, and an unwavering sense of dread. this dread is made possible by how the characters are crafted. watching them abandon dignity, hold onto false hope, and stomach such disturbing situations made me almost struggle to stay seated, a feat no other film has accomplished.   one cannot talk about this film without mentioning ellen burstyn's performance. she is tied with essie davis in the babadook for my favorite performance by an actress. what they do so well is make the viewers feel such pity for their miserable lives with performances so convincing that it's easy to forget that they are actors. although burstyn outshines everyone else, jared leto, marlon wayans, and jennifer connelly are fantastic in their roles, doing what aronofsky most definitely expected them to do: make the audience feel their characters' pain.  as well as the performances, what aronofsky does technically is equally astounding. whether a director can add more layers to the story than what is on paper is what separates a mediocre director from a great one, and aronofsky proves himself to be the latter. aronofsky uses the same editing technique each time a specific character takes a specific drug, for instance. as the viewer counts the times the technique is used, they feel more and more despair as the characters addictions become gradually stronger.   *****spoilers follow*****  where his technical skills really shined for me was the final scene where he wraps up the film perfectly. he shows a montage of our characters laying down, and provides so much with this one directorial choice. all characters except that of jared leto assume the fetal position. my interpretation of this is that it's a gesture of despair, conveying a similarity between them.  the position also indicates that they are clutching the one thing that helps them take their mind off their new unbearable lives. the reason harry (jared leto) does not assume the position is that he has nothing to hold on to. every other character does, but the thing that gives them hope is what makes each character arc distinct from the others.  tyrone (marlon wayans) clutches the thought of his mother, making him the most hopeful character since he is being forcefully held from his drugs and still has thoughts of a peaceful life. although the movie shared a theme with trainspotting in conveying the frightful easiness of slipping into addiction with the story of sara (ellen burstyn), darren aronofsky himself said that tyrone is the only character with hope of escape.   marion (jennifer connelly) is similar in that she has something that gives her hope, but different in that she has completely abandoned her life. she curls herself around the heroin she went to such desperate measures to get her hands on, showing how drugs are her salvation from her new life even though they are the cause.  the film concludes with perhaps the most depressing character arc in the movie, which is that of sara goldfarb. solidifying the heart-breaking monologue she gives earlier, the thing she holds on to is the fantasy of appearing on television. she knows this will never happen, but the thought of it comforts her. within this fantasy, her son harry is implied to have married his girlfriend marion and appears well-dressed and happy. him and his mother tell each other they love each other, and the film fades to its end credits. what makes this character arc the most depressing out of all of the others is that her son's life and their relationship being healthy is within the fantasy of her appearing on television. this suggests that her son loving her and vice versa is just as outlandish as her television fantasy. that notion is emphasized further by sara smiling, but tears running down her eyes can be seen.   the way aronofsky presented the film's wrap-up is the major highlight of his directorial talents within this movie. he knew to convey more ideas visually than what is shown through dialogue and the actors' performances, making this movie's presentation of the subject matter all the more complex. although it is a film that had me emotionally drained long after seeing it, i cannot deny that it is excellently crafted.",negative

No Name,5.0,"be prepared for one of the most violent nightmares imaginable, back in a time when, aronofsky, was more than capable of smashing your teeth in with a hammer for over an hour. requiem is the chilling tale that surrounds 4, drug addicted human beings, who are all connected. it  documents the progression of the rise and fall of drug addiction, showing the glamorous highs and the frightening lows, highlighting the extremes people will go to, in order to get their next fix. in aronofsky's second outing, he manages to craft a film so unique and arresting, its almost impossible to look away, despite the horror unfolding on screen. led by an all star cast, jennifer connelly, marlon waynes, jared leto and ellen burstyn, aronofsky lobs his characters into the depths of hell and then for good measure throws us, the audience, in after them. shot in a stylish but very rough looking demeanor, requiem may fool you into thinking your about to witness the same old drug related tale, however the script soon pole vaults into another world, full of dreams and aspirations, demands and exceptions, aronofsky isnt afraid to tackle some difficult subject matter here, really getting into the meat off all 4 characters downfalls and its harrowing to watch. his quick cut and ominous style becomes a staple of normality straight off the bat and paces the film wonderfully. requiem doesnt feel bloated, nor does it ever grind to a halt, its constantly on the move, utilizing sound and a blistering soundtrack from clint mansell and the kronos quartet, to its full advantage. the film weaves in and out of normality, using a wide array of visual techniques, in order to disorientate the audience, which by the finale will have you feeling like you, yourself are coming off a year long drug binge. it's horrible and gritty, intense and creative, stylish and violent to such an extent, requiem should come with a viewer discretion advised sticker. one of cinema's rare treats, that gets under your eyelids and stings for the duration of its stay, a must own, however approach with caution.",positive

No Name,4.5,"a powerful and disturbing story about addiction from darren aronofsky, requiem for a dream gives us the twin tales of a mother and sons fall into linked but very different drug-fuelled nightmares. there are moments of the darkest of humour as the lives of the pair spiral out of control but the fates of both are dealt with in an unflinching and graphic manner that is cold and disturbing. ellen burstyn and jared leto lead the cast and for me, burstyn's story is probably the most heart-breaking as we see the lonely old widow become dependent on tranquillisers and slimming pills as she becomes obsessed with the chance of appearing on a low-budget tv game show. this is a hard-hitting and deeply uncomfortable movie that seems as brutally relevant today as it was when it was first made over a decade ago. the score by the brilliant clint mansell underpins the onscreen imagery perfectly and has rightly gone on to have a life of its own, being instantly recognisable. not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, this is a powerful drama from a superb filmmaker.",negative

No Name,5.0,punch in the stomach . a film that you can't unsee.,negative
No Name,3.5,"wow, requiem for a dream is so dark and depressing. it is easily one of the most detailed looks into how drug abuse can destroy your life. aronofsky uses every trick in the director's playbook to give the audience the sensation of being affected by the addictions of the main characters. there is shaky camera work, there are dramatic focus shifts. even the music is used to create an unsettling atmosphere. it puts you on edge as a viewer, and makes it utterly impossible to relax while watching the movie. perhaps the most amazing thing to me was that the actors actually managed to make their characters sympathetic to me. there were moments where i actually wanted them to have a successful sale in order to dig themselves out of the pit they had fallen into. typically it's hard for me to identify with a movie character who continues to make the wrong decisions, but some magical combination of the script and the acting had me rooting for these people.  one of the most effective techniques that aronofsky used in this film are the repetitive smash-cut montages of each step that goes into taking drugs. it made for a really artistic way of showing how the drug abuse had become routine to the characters, and it also offered a great contrast when later ellen burstyn's character became addicted to her own drug of choice. i also enjoyed what this film had to say about people who struggle with a less toxic, but perhaps just as damaging, addiction like television. it makes you question your own life and look to see what you have grown overly attached to that might be getting in the way of more important things. the one thing about requiem for a dream that kind of holds me back from absolutely falling in love with it is that this film is exceedingly hard to watch. in fact i can't picture subjecting myself to it again, at least not for a really long time. while i do think it is amazingly well-constructed, and startlingly realistic, there's nothing that would prompt me to want to go through that again.",negative
No Name,4.0,best movie i will never watch again.,negative
No Name,4.0,"highly recommended to young and elderly people, or everyone with potential exposure to drug abuse. the movie brilliantly described the outcome of drug addiction behavior. portrayed lavishly in artistic manner, one may not notice the horrible hallucinogenic effect of drug prescription by any irresponsible medics.   the theme song haunts ludicrously from beginning to end, however it colored the right atmosphere the picture needs. grim, alarming, yet melancholic.   youth only come once, hence you may stumble once or few times but not to fall too deep nor steep for it may be too late to resuscitate later.",negative

No Name,3.0,"it's hard to know where that line lies between desires and addiction; aronofsky said this film isn't about drugs, it's about monsters -- everyone has potential to experience addiction to something (not necessarily drug related) and it's scary how fast you can fall under it's spell. the film did a great job of depicting just 4 examples of how addiction can change a person's life. even though none of the outcomes were good, the mother's story hit closer to home for me. i've never come close to wanting to do drugs, so hers was the most relatable. it's great to have goals and strive to be something better, but when that turns into obsession -- or rather, addiction -- you could be doing more harm than good.",negative

No Name,3.5,"while most people see movies solely for entertainment value, several of us actually welcome a challenge. requiem for a dream is a graphic and often unpleasant movie, but it's evident that was the intention. disney cartoons and comic-book blockbusters are all fine and good, but movies like this are the reason i'm a movie addict. movies about young, strung-out junkies are not new. movies like another day in paradise, rush, and kids all addressed similar issues, to varying degrees of success. the tough part is not showing the ugliness of heroin addiction. just watch someone shooting up and you're seeing a tragedy. what's difficult is presenting honest characters, and not apologizing for their actions. they're not heroes or villains in aronofsky's hands, and how you feel about these characters lies with you. the screenplay doesn't guide you, and any movie that forces you to decide things for yourself is always a welcome change.  everyone has their addictions, right? for some, it's crack cocaine. others can't function without their morning cup of coffee. love, contentment, approval, happiness; wish for any of them too hard, and you find yourself an addict. darren aronofsky's requiem for a dream displays how rampant addiction affects the lives of four interlocked characters, and it's not a pretty picture. but that's exactly why this is an excellent movie. while several scenes are of unnerving discomfort, the intention is never simply to shock. a filmmaker can ""stun"" an audience whenever he wants to; it's his party. the tough part is to tell a story and prove thematic points by using the shock value responsibly.  harry (jared leto) is a heroin addict. when we first meet him, he is appropriating his mother's television set to hock for his next ""fix"". long-suffering mother sarah (ellen burstyn) screams with her son, but never really gets angry with him. five minutes later, she's simply buying the tv back. harry's best friend tyrone (marlon wayans) and girlfriend marion (jennifer connelly) also participate in harry's hypodermic activities, and the three eventually hatch a plan: to become dealers on their own and make thousands of bucks! meanwhile, sarah has received a strange phone call, promising her a spot as a tv contestant. alone in her home, she quickly begins preparing for her night on tv by popping diet pills.  this is a movie of several excellent components, most notably a handful of excellent performances, a restrained yet visually stunning directorial style, and a hypnotic musical score. while a handful of scenes linger a bit too long, that's a nearly pointless complaint in a movie so strong on nearly every other level. requiem for a dream is not a ""fun"" movie, nor is it merely a drug-related melodrama. this is a smart movie about how addiction shackles people, for movie fans who can handle the heavy stuff.  ellen burstyn is remarkable in this movie. while she hasn't been seen in films too often lately, her performance simply should place her back in this should have placed her in the public eye. as a woman who becomes increasingly more unable to deal with reality, she is heart-breakingly believable, and the result is one of the best acting performances i have seen. also quite surprising is the work of jennifer connelly, in a nearly impossible role. her stunning beauty has somehow mislabeled her as a ""pin-up"" actress, as she's nearly always excellent, regardless of how small the role. she'll get a lot of attention for her courageous performance. jared leto is serviceable as the anti-hero harry. although it's easy to buy him as a junkie, he simply plays his role too clean-cut most of the time. leto is tough to buy him as a sleazy addict when he looks like the cover of a teen magazine. director aronofsky presents several unique sequences, and he offers several harsh and resonant montage sequences, some truly shocking visual sequences, and a wonderfully effective usage of sound effects. (each moment of addiction satisfaction is presented in a rapid-fire display of color, light and sound.) especially memorable is the use of the infectious score by clint mansell, which gives the movie a dark, desperate heartbeat.  much has currently been made of the mpaa's decision to threaten this movie an nc-17 rating, thanks to a sequence near the end, which depicts some particularly unsavory acts. apparently, the mpaa missed the point of this movie entirely. by deleting (or even editing) the scene in question would negate the entire point of the movie: that true addiction leads to true degradation. i was glad he didn't compromise.  i can't promise that you'll love this movie, but you'll be able to see how censoring a movie can sometimes disembowel it. requiem for a dream is a tough movie to watch, but the film offers a lot to enjoy. darren aronofsky deftly avoids many of the ""drug-movie"" cliches so evident in other films of this style, and his film is a sobering and fascinating piece of work. while this movie is not for all tastes, i can recommend it as one of the best and bravest drug-movies ever made . requiem for a dream is a film that will stay with you long after you leave the theater, and it's a rare film that can do that.",negative
No Name,5.0,"everything about this movie is fantastic. the score, the acting, the story, the writing, the directing, the visuals, literally everything. no movie has ever left me feeling so hopeless before, and to this day it is the only movie that has physically shaken me.  requiem for a dream is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and it might very well be the best movie of the 2000s thus far. if you haven't seen it, i implore you to watch it.  11/10",positive

No Name,5.0,"so mad at myself for putting off seeing this film for so long. this film is mainly about the abuse of drugs and how they end up ruining your life one way or another if you have no self control. but then again, heroin is said to be quite addicting.  harry (jared leto), girlfriend marion (jennifer connolly) and friend and partner tyrone (marlon wayans) are good friends who like to do drugs. but they either do it to feel good in general or to stop themselves from feeling bad in a bad situation. this film gives a great look into how addicts do drugs and everything is all better to them. harry and tyrone get into a sticky situation when they are in need of more drugs so they take part in a drug lord's operation, making them eventually travel from their hometown of brooklyn to miami, where harry is forcibly taken to the hospital by tyrone so doctors can take a look at his dead arm. at the end of the film, the two of them end up going to prison and harry's arm is amputated.  marion on the other hand continues to support her addiction by taking part in prostitution and sex rings.  as for another important character, sara (ellen burstyn) is harry's mother who is widowed and stays home and watches her favorite infomercial/game show all day long. she gets a call one day saying that she has been chosen to appear on said show. to lose weight, she tries to go on a diet, failing, and then succumbing to horribly addicting diet pills.  it's a sad road sara travels on. she becomes addicted to these pills and becomes mentally unstable, waiting to hear from the producers of the show to tell her when she can be on the show.  in the end, all four characters curl up in a fettle position. i cried deeply.  this film is so sad but also, so incredible well directed and edited with great camera work and great fast paced scenes (hip hop cuts), especially cuts on drug related items during at which time the audience assumes the characters are getting high.  such a once in a lifetime film. every mature minded individual should see it.  requiem for a dream, i give you a 100%.",negative

No Name,4.5,"""oh my god harry.."" - the opening line to my absolute favorite bastille song (it's a cover song, but i don't give a shiz): requiem for blue jeans. the movie starts out on a frantic/sad/confusing/angry note, and spirals out of control so fast, you won't even know what hit you. from a non-drug addicts perspective, requiem has you trying to relate to what everyone is feeling or going through, it's a roller coaster of back catalog memories. requiem is a massive slap in the face to anyone that has a drug addiction, and if they continue to use after having seen this movie, well, may god have mercy on their soul. the editing and imagery was executed perfectly. at no point in the film did i feel lost (except the first 5 minutes, but then everything became very clear to me what was going on) or confused about the timeline of events taking place, it flowed exceedingly well. the amount of sorrow i felt for each character at certain points, summoned ol' kermit to the back of my throat. when kermit makes an appearance, i know the movie is a winner. requiem for a dream is extremely powerful and should not be taken with a grain of salt. thanks to this recommendation, i could finally put a face to yet another favorite bastille cover song of mine. the song: what would you do -- fades out with the following quote, ""it's a reason to get up in the morning. it's a reason to lose weight, to fit in the red dress. it's a reason to smile. it makes tomorrow all right."" i never searched the quote or let it bother me too much that i didn't have the slightest clue what movie it came from, because it was too beautiful to want to google it. there was a certain air of mystery behind the voice that i loved hearing so much. however, the pictures in my mind will be that much more meaningful to these songs after having seen this movie. and yes, i have a terrible addiction to bastille. let's just hope it doesn't spiral out of control..",positive

No Name,5.0,"""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"": a magical cinematic journey ""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" is a film that has captured the hearts and imaginations of audiences around the world. based on the beloved novel by j.k. rowling, it introduced us to a world of wizards, witches, and magical creatures that has since become a cultural phenomenon. the story follows harry potter, an ordinary boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard and has been invited to attend hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. harry, who has lived a rather miserable life with his cruel aunt and uncle, is thrust into a world of wonder and mystery. at hogwarts, he makes friends with ron weasley and hermione granger and together they begin to uncover the secrets of the school, including the mystery surrounding the sorcerer's stone. one of the most remarkable aspects of the film is its world-building. the hogwarts school is a character in itself, with its moving staircases, hidden passages, and enchanted classrooms. the great hall, with its floating candles and four long tables representing the four hogwarts houses, is a sight to behold. the forbidden forest, with its menacing creatures like centaurs and unicorns, adds an element of danger and excitement. the attention to detail in creating this magical world is truly astonishing. it makes the viewers feel as if they too could step through the screen and attend hogwarts. the characters are also a major highlight. daniel radcliffe brings harry potter to life with his wide-eyed innocence and determination. rupert grint as ron is the perfect sidekick, providing comic relief and loyalty. emma watson's hermione is intelligent, brave, and a bit bossy, making for a great foil to the other two. the supporting cast is equally impressive. from the wise and kind albus dumbledore played by richard harris to the strict severus snape portrayed by alan rickman, each character is well-cast and adds depth to the story. the chemistry between the three main characters is palpable and their friendship is one of the most endearing aspects of the film. the special effects, considering the time when the film was made, are quite impressive. the quidditch matches are a particular standout. the flying broomsticks, the speeding bludgers, and the elusive golden snitch all look realistic and add a sense of excitement and adventure. the magical creatures, such as fluffy the three-headed dog and norbert the dragon, are also well-animated and add to the overall charm of the film. the film also has a great sense of adventure and mystery. as harry and his friends try to figure out who is trying to steal the sorcerer's stone and what their motives are, the audience is taken along for the ride. the puzzles and challenges they face, from the devil's snare to the chess game, keep the tension high and the viewers engaged. however, like any adaptation, it does have some limitations. some of the more complex plot points and character backstories from the book are simplified, which may disappoint die-hard fans. also, the pacing in some parts could be a bit slower, especially in the beginning as it takes time to introduce the world and the characters. nevertheless, ""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" is a classic that has stood the test of time. it opened the door to a franchise that would go on to span multiple films and inspire a generation. it introduced us to a world of magic that we all wished we could be a part of. the themes of friendship, courage, and the battle between good and evil are universal and resonate with audiences of all ages. it is a film that can be watched and rewatched, each time revealing something new and magical. whether you are a wizarding world enthusiast or just someone looking for an entertaining and heartwarming adventure, this film is a must-see.  i usually use these two sites for more free movies and short dramas.if you have a better website, please recommend it to me. thank you https://omnishort.com/Ôºüutm_source=rottentomatoes https://nightgod.tv/Ôºüutm_source=rottentomatoes",positive

No Name,4.5,"harry potter and the sorcerer‚Äôs stone (2001), directed by chris columbus, is a magical adventure that takes viewers to a world full of magic and mystery. based on the famous book by j.k. rowling, this movie introduces us to harry potter, a young boy who finds out on his 11th birthday that he is a wizard. the film is full of creativity, showing us a world where anything can happen, and it‚Äôs the perfect start to the harry potter series. the movie follows harry potter (played by daniel radcliffe), who has been living with his mean aunt and uncle. on his birthday, he learns that he is a wizard and gets invited to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. at hogwarts, harry makes two new friends, ron weasley (rupert grint) and hermione granger (emma watson). together, they discover the secret of the sorcerer‚Äôs stone, a magical object that can make someone live forever. they must protect the stone from an evil wizard named voldemort, who is trying to get it for himself. as harry and his friends face challenges, they learn about friendship, bravery, and who they really are. this movie is the first in the harry potter series, and it sets up a big adventure for harry. although this film finishes its story about the sorcerer‚Äôs stone, it leaves the door open for more exciting moments in the next movie. i would definitely watch the next film, harry potter and the chamber of secrets, because the story and the characters get even more interesting. one of the best things about the film is its creativity. the way they show the magical world of hogwarts is amazing, from the flying broomsticks to the magical creatures. the movie uses great special effects to bring the magic to life, making it feel like you are right there in the world of wizards. the movie‚Äôs sets, like the hogwarts castle and the moving staircases, are also beautiful and show how much effort went into creating this world. the movie‚Äôs characters are another strength. daniel radcliffe, rupert grint, and emma watson do a great job playing harry, ron,  and hermione. they are very believable as friends, and their performances make you feel connected to them. the movie also has some wonderful supporting actors, like richard harris, who plays dumbledore, and alan rickman, who plays snape. they both add a lot to the movie with their strong performances. harry potter and the sorcerer‚Äôs stone has a lot of themes that make it interesting. it talks about friendship, courage, and finding out who you are. harry learns about his past, and he also has to figure out how to use his new magical powers. the theme of good versus evil is also important in the movie, with harry fighting against the dark forces of voldemort. these themes are something everyone can understand and relate to, whether you are a child or an adult. however, the movie does have a few weak points. at the beginning, when harry is learning about the wizarding world, things move a bit slowly. the early scenes, like when harry is with his aunt and uncle or traveling to hogwarts, could be more exciting. also, while voldemort is the main villain, he doesn‚Äôt show up much in this movie, so he might feel less scary compared to what you might expect. finally, some parts of the story, like who is behind certain secrets, can be a little predictable if you are older, but younger viewers might still enjoy the surprises. in conclusion, harry potter and the sorcerer‚Äôs stone is a magical, fun movie that introduces us to a wonderful world of wizards. it has great special effects, a strong cast, and interesting themes about friendship and courage. although it starts a bit slow and doesn‚Äôt show the full power of the villain, it is still an exciting movie that sets the stage for bigger adventures. i recommend this movie to anyone who loves magic, adventure, or just a good story. i would definitely watch the next film in the series. i give this movie 4.5 out of 5 stars",positive

No Name,4.0,"today, i delved into the magical world of harry potter and the sorcerer's stone for the first time. this film was a massive success in theaters, eventually achieving cult classic status worldwide.  as i immersed myself in the movie, i realized that my knowledge of the story was quite limited, mostly derived from snippets of information i had picked up along the way. the special effects, particularly the cgi, may seem outdated by today's standards, but considering the era in which it was made, the filmmakers did a commendable job without going overboard.  the performances of radcliffe and watson were simply outstanding, bringing their characters to life with depth and authenticity. ron's character provided a delightful touch of comedic relief, adding to the overall charm of the film.  while the anticipation surrounding the movie may not have matched the actual viewing experience, i found myself expecting a more intense and prolonged battle for the sorcerer's stone. however, i acknowledge that as the first film in the series, it likely aimed to establish the foundation of the story.  in the end, i believe that while the film may not have had a laser-focused narrative, it still managed to captivate me and left me eager to explore the next installment.",positive

No Name,4.5,"well then, we have harry potter, one of britain's favorite books and films. one of them which got popularity throughout the years and many kids and my friends have seen them when they're in school and only wished they would visit the warner bros world to see hogwarts school to see some amazing stuff. just like i reviewed the fantastic beast trilogy, i thought had my dream come true by doing one of those harry potter films since i've thinking about doing them for a while. the professors at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, albus dumbledore and minerva mcgonagall played by richard harris and maggie smith, along with groundskeeper rubeus hagrid played by robbie coltrane, had come to deliver an orphaned infant wizard named harry potter played by daniel ratcliffe, to his muggle aunt and uncle. years later, just before his eleventh birthday, owls begin delivering letters addressed to him. when the abusive dursleys adamantly refuse to allow harry to open any and flee to an island hut, hagrid arrives to personally deliver harry's letter of acceptance to hogwarts. at king's cross station, harry boards the hogwarts express train, and meets fellow students ron weasley and hermione granger played by rupert grint and emma watson, during the journey. arriving at hogwarts, harry also meets draco malfoy, whom the two immediately form a rivalry. the students assemble in the great hall where the sorting hat sorts the first-years into four respective houses such as gryffindor, hufflepuff, ravenclaw, and slytherin. harry is placed into gryffindor alongside ron and hermione, while draco is placed into slytherin. and now the school sessions begins trouble is brewing. i remember getting into harry potter as a kid since that i'm not the only one who is. of course many people recognise the actors who played the teachers, of course everybody remembers richard harris as professor dumbledore who is the greatest headmaster and and powerful wizards of all time. ""silence!"" robbie coltrane as hagrid is such a lovable character. he just has all the charm like any character has ever got. we have everyone's favorite actor, alan rickman as professor severus snape who is the head of slytherin and everyone's greatest teacher of hogwarts. and then we have dame maggie smith as professor mcgonagall who is the headmistress, the head of gryffindor and transfiguration teacher at hogwarts. you can only see bits of john cleese as nearly headless nick including david bradley as argus filch and john hurt only has one scene in it. yep, that's all the actors that every single person in the world remembers including the main actors who are kids at the time. they'll be seeing more whilst i mention in the later reviews of harry potter. harry potter and the philosopher's stone is just your brilliantly good film to start off the franchise that everyone remembers and bring the nostalgic feel to it even if if feels like you're at school as well. i really do love the music by john williams known for his work on jaws, star wars, close encounters of the third kind, superman, indiana jones, e.t. the extra-terrestrial, jurassic park and many more you can ever think of. i did like the visual effects even though they do seem a bit outdated but when you look at it you'll know what i mean but what can i say, this is made in the early 2000's. what a way to start off a movie franchise that everybody loves including myself. i love this film and i can't wait to do some more reviews in these. with that being said, i love harry potter and the philosopher's stone and many more reviews are coming up soon so be ready.",positive

No Name,5.0,"after watching harry potter and the sorcerer's stone, i only have amazing things to say about it! this is the first time i had ever read or watched anything to do with harry potter and it was phenomenal. even though it was two hours and thirty minutes long, and having a very small attention span, it grabbed my attention and it never let go. this movie never let me get bored with all of the plot twists and plot thickening moments. in this movie it starts out with harry (protagonist) living in a closet under the stairs, with his aunt and uncle. his life was not fulfilled, he was treated terribly and was an afterthought. harry was a special boy, he learns that he was born a wizard. he unfortunately does not have his mom and dad to be around because they died tragically. soon after hagrid (wizard) showed up and hand delivered an invitation to hogwarts after many failed attempts. harry quickly accepted and was on his way. after a bit of trial and error he got onto the train and met ron weasley (best friend). ron is also a new wizard and first time student to hogwarts, however a lot of his brothers go to hogwarts so he is familiar with most terms. soon after harry and ron were introduced to hermoine granger (soon to be best friend). hermoine also was new to hogwarts. she has a lot of sass and it seems as though her family life is alright and that they are very supportive of her. they get to hogwarts, and are sorted into houses. hermoine, harry, and ron all get into the same house. after lots of battles and conquering, and a pretty wicked quidditch game, they go on their trek to protect the sorcerer's stone from he who shall not be named (voldemort). overall this movie had flawless production every character had amazing chemistry together and the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. i would recommend that everyone at least once in their lifetime give this movie a good watch.",positive

No Name,4.0,"if the first harry potter's book is not as amazing as the newest ones, this first movie is at least giving justice to the book and providing great atmosphere to the story.  the actors are still young and one can see that, but it is also part of the charm as they appear quite genuine. the older actors are great in their roles and they are able to also provide those hints that make the more attentive audience wondering if they got the movie right.  the movie is quite accurate, although i had imagined some things differently, when it comes to propose the magical harry potter's world. the movie is entertaining and not boring - i wish that also the other movies would keep up the same tempo and vibrant storytelling as this one.",positive

No Name,5.0,because i'm the biggest fan of the series ever!!!!!,positive
No Name,5.0,"harry potter would undoubtedly have been a classic solely in its book form, but, thanks to the cast and crew of the film adaptations, the series has become a phenomenon. from detail-attentive storytelling to character castings that feel like the creators performed real magic to pull them from the pages, harry potter and the philosopher's stone smartly uses its beefy runtime to tell an unmissable coming-of-age fantasy.   distinct aesthetics create a strong, old-timey feel with john williams' musical score complimenting with a special magic of its own. if there's any soundtrack that can transport millennials back to their younger, likely happier days, it's the haunting and epic magic williams crafts for the film.  the philosopher's stone is pure imagination brought to life, and i have to give credit to absolute standout performances by robbie coltrane, emma watson, and alan rickman. adaptations rarely hit as hard as the harry potter ones do, but even fewer scar pop culture in a way that, even two decades later, newbies and fans alike can be ensouled by the magic here.",positive

No Name,3.5,"the first film in the franchise, it is definitely not a completely polished or coherent movie. you can tell important plot points are cut from the book, and (this is personal preference) the film feels much too kiddish. other than that, it's a great fantasy adventure, successfully introducing me to the whimsical and inviting wizarding world. the look and feel of the castle and anything wizard-related is amazing, the production designer and his team understood the assignment. john williams' score compliments this magical story perfectly, and encapsulates the atmosphere in a bottle. the red herrings and climactic plot twist show a level of intellect to the writing of this story, so i can't wait to see how the next adventures play out.",positive

No Name,5.0,"excelente pel√≠cula, un inicio brillante de lo que seria una saga de pel√≠culas hist√≥rica. es una excelente pel√≠cula y en mi opini√≥n, a pesar de sus peque√±as fallas, es perfecta, ya que con esta empez√≥ todo y sent√≥ las bases del mundo m√°gico de harry potter, logrando que una gran cantidad de gente sea fan de esta franquicia. se puede decir que esta cinta y la siguiente son las m√°s infantiles, sin embargo nunca me lo pareci√≥ ya que yo pienso que el film tiene momentos muy oscuros y perturbadores con los que un ni√±o de esa √©poca podr√≠a tener pesadillas. el cast, principalmente el del tr√≠o protagonista compuesto por daniel radcliffe, rupert grint y emma watson, es excelente. por otro lado, cuenta con una gran cantidad de actores de renombre que brindan una brillante actuaci√≥n tambi√©n como lo son alan rickman, richard harris, maggie smith, robbie coltrane, tom felton, etc. una de las cosas mas destacables de la cinta y de la saga es su banda sonora, en este caso compuesta por el maestro john williams, quien nos trajo uno de sus mejores trabajos y tambi√©n uno de los m√°s recordados de su carrera con una sinton√≠a perfecta con toques divertidos, alegres, misteriosos y m√°gicos, d√°ndole un toque hermoso y especial a la franquicia. los efectos especiales, a pesar de que ya quedaron viejos, creo que no se ven tan mal, tiene algunas cosas que se ven notoriamente falsas o hechas por computadora pero no es un escandalo visualmente. en conclusi√≥n, una excelente pel√≠cula, un cl√°sico del cine ya que es el inicio de una de las sagas mas populares del siglo xxi, d√°ndonos una presentaci√≥n del mundo m√°gico y la primera aparici√≥n del trio protagonista que nos iba a maravillar durante todas las pel√≠culas. muy recomendada.",positive

No Name,5.0,"final thoughts:  harry potter would undoubtedly have been a classic in its book form, but, thanks to the cast and crew of the film adaptations, the series became a phenomenon. from detail-attentive storytelling to character castings that feel like the creators performed real magic to pull them from the pages, harry potter and the philosopher's stone smartly uses its beefy runtime to tell an unmissable coming-of-age fantasy. a strong, old-timey feel creates distinct aesthetics, and john williams' musical score is a special magic of its own.  for the full review and more posts like it, visit my site: https://thephoenixprjct.com",positive

No Name,4.0,"""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" is a film that will transport viewers to a world of wonder and enchantment. from the moment the opening credits begin to roll, audiences are swept away by the stunning visuals, soaring score, and captivating performances.   one of the strengths of the film is its ability to capture the spirit of rowling's beloved book series. from the charmingly british setting to the quirky characters, the movie perfectly captures the essence of the story. fans of the books will delight in seeing their favorite scenes and characters brought to life on the big screen, while newcomers to the series will be captivated by the film's unique blend of magic and adventure.   at the heart of ""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" is its trio of young heroes. daniel radcliffe, rupert grint, and emma watson shine as harry, ron, and hermione, respectively, bringing a perfect blend of humor, heart, and heroism to their roles. radcliffe, in particular, is a revelation as harry, imbuing the character with a vulnerability and determination that make him an instantly likable protagonist. grint and watson, meanwhile, provide strong support as harry's loyal friends, bringing their own unique charms to the roles.   the supporting cast is equally impressive. richard harris is perfect as the wise and kindly headmaster albus dumbledore, while maggie smith brings a stern authority to her role as professor mcgonagall. alan rickman is also outstanding as the snide and sinister professor snape, a character who becomes increasingly important as the series progresses. together, the cast creates a rich and diverse tapestry of characters that are both memorable and engaging.   visually, the film is a feast for the eyes. the hogwarts school is brought to life with breathtaking detail, from the moving staircases to the enchanted portraits lining the walls. the special effects are also impressive, particularly in the scenes involving quidditch, a magical sport played on flying broomsticks. john williams' iconic score is the perfect accompaniment to the action, conveying a sense of wonder and excitement that perfectly captures the spirit of the story.   despite its many strengths, however, ""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" is not without its flaws. the pacing can be a bit uneven at times, with some scenes feeling rushed while others drag on. the film also has to condense a lot of material from the book, resulting in some important plot points feeling somewhat underdeveloped. at times, it can feel like the film is trying to cram too much into its two-hour runtime.   that being said, these criticisms are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. ""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" is a film that will capture the hearts and imaginations of viewers young and old. it is a testament to the power of storytelling and a reminder of the magic that can be found in even the most ordinary of places. with its charming characters, breathtaking visuals, and timeless story, ""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" is a true classic of modern cinema and a must-see for anyone who loves movies or magic.",positive

No Name,4.5,"my opinion  the first time i watched this movie, i was very excited about it because it was a fantasy movie and created it interesting and realistic in the characters.  it's all all of them and when watching continuously, it's very fun. if the movie comes out at each time, i think i am one of them that will definitely follow the story of this story and is a movie that can be seen.  all ages and is a movie that anyone who sees it for the first time must be excited and follow the movie from the search for information to a movie made from a personal novel. i didn't read a novel before watching the movie.  but saw people who read the movie say that the content in the novel is more diverse and more detailed in the movie and in the movie has changed a lot of chapters  but if watching a movie and going to read a novel, it might change the perspective of watching movies in another way.   the plot of the movie is based on the story of a character named harry potter who lost his parents as a child without knowing the real reason and was raised by his biological aunt.  which the feasting is not good at all  his aunt raised him like he was a servant.  and when he reached the criteria that he had to study  the magic school had sent him a letter to attend as a preparation.  his parents actually said that his parents had died by being killed and had taken harry to go shopping for school.  and studied at the magic school for the first time, got to know the friendship that he had accidentally encountered and learned through both the good and the bad side together as this friendship is like the only family that harry  there is in life, no matter how the story is, his friends will help and take care of each other. it is considered a movie that represents very good friendship.  and saw the development of harry trained to use in the fight against the people who killed his parents.  the story of harry potter is a very interesting movie, if anyone has not seen this movie, it is a missed opportunity.   in summary, from looking at and searching for information and seeing different opinions that  this movie is considered a very popular movie, most of them have to watch and are movies that can be accessed by all ages, with interesting content, worth watching and may  getting the content from watching this movie. overall, this movie is a magic movie, making people interested and is a realistic movie and may be different from other movies and the scripts have changed to the novel.  to have an understanding, but it may not be as detailed as the novel, for those who have read the novel may not like it that much, but it is still a favorite movie and a favorite movie for many people as well.  how many times do you think of a movie that you have to come back and watch?",positive

No Name,4.0,"solid movie. the acting is good. even though the child actors are just ok really it's the veteran supporting cast that doe a great job balancing things out. robbie coltrane is the best actor in the film with a great deal of charm more than anyone. the cinematography is very well done with very elaborate sets and well shot scenes. the only thing is the cgi at times doesn't look as good as the rest of the practical sets most of the time. the music is very well done also. the only real major knocks to this film are the editing & pacing which while still are solid, have a bit too many ideas. the film feels like the first half is about harry & his friends adjusting to school while the second half is about the mystery of the stone. this is fine but the problem is it starts to drag and feels bloated. it feels like its being too faithful to the novel while sacrificing focus. some scenes like the flying game, going into the restricted section could have been cut and nothing would be lost. although there well done scenes. also the first half with them adjusting to school feels like the scenes don't put together don't have a logical flow although there still well done. also its worth noting most of this film has a very childish feel to it while the final act does go on the dark side and get more intense which i enjoyed. in conclusion despite some unremarkable child acting, bloated run time and unfocused narrative at times this is a solid film that holds up well. definitely worth a watch for any fan of the franchise and worth viewing to get to the others.",positive

No Name,4.5,"harry potter and the sorcerer's stone is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. the franchise has been a large part of my life for most of my life. with the first book coming out when i was three years old and the first movie when i was seven, there is a special place in my heart for the wizarding world of harry potter.  i know that it is not the most remarkable piece of art when looking at it from a filmmaking perspective. however, let us remember that this movie was made for children. when it comes to world-building and enveloping the audience, i would argue that this movie goes toe to toe with lord of the rings and some of the other greats.  what chris columbus and company did is nothing short of game-changing. they took excellent source material, stayed true to the book and built upon it. the visuals, specifically involving hogwarts, are gorgeous. the score by john williams is one of the most recognizable of all time. the characters are instantly likeable (or despicable). there is honestly so much to praise and love about this movie.  while not every scene is necessary to the plot, those ""pointless"" scenes further add to the feeling of magic. from sitting in flitwick's classroom to ruminating on a windowsill with an owl, i could watch footage of hogwarts on repeat. this is a movie that i could turn on at any time and jump right into the story. simply put, i instantly have a warm feeling which stays with me the whole way through.  while the acting and dialogue have some rough moments, particularly with the younger actors, the casting is excellent. from alan rickman and robbie coltrane to richard harris and maggie smith, there is not a single dud when it comes to the adult cast. the students are also perfectly cast, with the main trio's chemistry on full display.  at the end of the day i'll say it again, i know that this is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. the movie is highly rewatchable, endlessly quotable and enchantingly enjoyable. when defining ""comfort film"", this movie is at the top of the list. simply put, harry potter and the sorcerer's stone set the stage for one of the most popular movie franchises of all time and one of the most impactful parts of my childhood.  best character: rubeus hagrid best moment: arriving to hogwarts on the boats. best quote: ""it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."" - albus dumbledore  additional note: having the house cup ripped from slytherin is why i have issues with premature celebration. that being said, the whole sequence is still chill-inducing.",positive

No Name,3.5,"although this movie fails to live up to the source material, it succeeds in creating a movie full of heart, and passion. this movie may have it's flaws, but there's something about the vibe of this movie that makes it magical (pun intended). the performances from daniel radcliffe, rupert grint, and emma watson are great and fit the movie perfectly. their chemistry really makes them feel like actual people. not to mention snape's actor, brilliant! the plot is good, but it's ripped straight from the book, so that's really a given.  there are certain gripes i have with the movie, though. the cgi in certain segments feel really dated, and sequences in the film can be corny. however, this is to be expected from an early 2000s movie based off a ya novel.  it's also very faithful to the original (as implied above), which is a plus, but ends up feeling unpolished, due to the fact that it has to leave out lots of things from the book.  what the movie lacks in technical skill, it makes up for in warmth. which, really, is all fans were asking for.",positive

No Name,4.0,"just as a preface, i read all the books before watching the movies. after reading them back in 2012 (and rereading them multiple time), harry potter is probably my favorite franchise to date (both the books and the movies). the books are perfection, so it makes it very hard for me not to view these films as a fan of the books, but as a fan of modern cinema.  i have watched the movies in the past, and decided to rewatch the series for old times sake. the sorcerers stone is a solid opener to the series. it does a great job at establishing the world, the characters, etc. it is just a fun, mostly happy childhood movie that creates that emoptional connection between viewer and the universe. if you are watching this series for the first time, you will love this movie. however, as someone who has seen these films before and knows the ins and outs of the universe, this first movie is a bit slow at times; struggling from pacing issues. some of the effects have aged pretty poorly, and the cinematography is quite bland. with all that said, still a dope opener to the best saga ever!",positive

Stefanie K,5.0,sooo much fun seeing this in the theater!  these are some of my favorite movies.  so well done and the cast is perfect!,positive
No Name,5.0,"there's nothing like the first there's nothing like the first in a series, is there? the introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. no matter how many harry potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, harry potter and the sorcerer's stone.  i'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the harry potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but i'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. the lights dimmed, john williams's perfect theme played its first notes as richard harris walked down privet drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. john williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. as other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. there's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.  welcome to the world of harry potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. daniel radcliffe, emma watson, rupert grint, and tom felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. i always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, i cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. and these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!  usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. in the harry potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. richard harris, maggie smith, alan rickman, and robbie coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental mcgonagall, the endlessly mimicable snape, and the jolly hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to richard harris, point out striped cats as ""maggie smith cats"", mumble ""shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like alan rickman?  first movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. in j.k. rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. seeing the hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. the great hall, quidditch, the sorting hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these harry potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying bertie bott's every flavor beans.  each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. if a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what richard harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. if somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie",positive
No Name,5.0,"harry potter is one of my favorite franchises of all time. huge fan. this one started it all based on the famous book by jk rowling. the film gorgeously directed by chris columbus of home alone fame boasts an incredible cast of veteran british thespians including richard harris, maggie smith, the late alan rickman, and john hurt. but this movie would not work without the trio of harry, ron, and hermione played respectively by daniel radcliffe, rupert grint, and emma watson. here at the beginning of their careers as children they carry this movie from beginning to end and their chemistry makes for one of the most memorable trios in cinema. the script manages to tell the story in a reasonable amount of time given the amount of set up. the special effects are really an incredible achievement and transports us into a fantasy world that feels grounded. the creatures, props, and sets bring harry's world to life in a way never before seen in movies. finally, the score by the legend john williams is perhaps one of the most beautiful and joyful scores ever and has reached iconic status. this film is a masterpiece filled with imagination and wonder that left an entire generation including me in love with harry potter",positive

No Name,2.5,"the whole movie feels very disjointed. it subtly hints at the storyline scene after scene, the plot thickening as you go through, but for the most part... it feels like just one scene after another. it's not a bad movie by any means, but probably my least favorite of the franchise. the acting isn't great either. it's fun. this isn't the fault of the book either. the movie just doesn't quite capture the magic and engagement either. after sitting through mediocre acting and just class after class, it kind of pulls you out of the movie. the lord of the rings movies took the masterful books and turn it into visual works of art. the movies are classics. the harry potter movies are just... fun. they slowly get better and better. although the harry potter movies are quite possibly more enjoyable.",positive

No Name,3.5,"harry potter and the sorcerers stone is another well made production, from good set pieces, magical costumes, imaginative score, impressive visuals, and enjoyable young actors/actresses. the only problem that this movie has, is that some characters spill out exposition, and we are supposed to keep in contact with all this info that is scattered around this 2hr. 30 minute movie, and it kind get a bit tiring after a while. so 7/10, it's hard to poke holes at this movie.",positive

No Name,3.5,"a reasonably strong first entry into jk rowling's smash-hit series, sorcerer's stone manages to capture the essence of the book, and streamline the many details and plot points of its magical world into an entertaining adventure. however, the movie's dedication to maintaining it's faithfullness to the book is at times also it's weakness, where it can feel bogged down. some sequences do not lend themselves to the screen so well, and might be better left out for a more even-pace. still, this movie represents a strong first chapter that will please both hardcore book fans and first-time harry potter viewers alike.",positive
No Name,3.5,"the harry potter novels were a huge component in the scaffolding that formed my creativity. at the time that these films began to be released i was deep into the fandom, unable to be objective. to fully own up to it i was a hater of these films, constantly looking for issues and unwilling to give them an inch of credibility. recently my niece asked me about them, and when she discovered that i had stopped part way through the film universe asked me to watch them with her. this will be my second viewing of the first four movies though nearly two decades have passed since i last saw the philosopher's stone (i refuse to recognize the bastardized title). it will be my first time experiencing the final four pictures.  the opening sequences of the philosopher's stone were charming albeit in a disturbing fashion. the abuse young harry suffers at the hands of the dursley's feels bizarre when viewed through a pg prism. though the creative team does a great job bringing rowling's magical world to life, which kind of sadly quickly takes your mind off the darker elements. outside of radcliff the cast does an incredible job embodying these iconic characters  while i don't think i'll ever be able to separate the films from their incredible counterparts, i did myself a disservice all those years ago. i'm excited to make up for lost time.",negative

No Name,3.0,"harry potter and the sorcerer's stone, directed by chris columbus, was a wonderful, wizardly time! knowing chris columbus from home alone, i was a little skeptical going into this film, but he put his intuitive style all over it, shooting a real dazzling looking film.  the overall concept of the film is outrageously original, filled with tremendous potential and heart, with many memorable scenes! the premise of the film is where the issues come in. the premise is fine, and good kickstart for this favorable series, but it wasn't focused, or fleshed out nearly enough; all the creative team cared about was setting up all this exposition. the exposition is fine to a certain extent, but when seventy percent of the film is exposition, with another fifteen percent being some fan service-filler scenes, it makes it hard to get invested into what's going on, at this point in time. if the creative team cut out most of their filler scenes, they could've tightened up the narrative more, while giving the film an easier run time to digest. the film had a pretty decent pace for more than sixty percent of the film, but the middle act became more of a slowburn pace, creating a few unnecessary plots, that just got left to die.  i give so much credit to these casting directors, for casting this star-studded cast! with this film being filled with a lot of characters, the creative team did a good job of balancing everyone, crafting countless memorable character moments, while giving them some nice layers to start to develop. it's no secret to say that the three main wizards in, daniel radcliffe, emma watson, and rupert grint, are the selling point to this film! almost automatically, they're given phenomenal chemistry, and banter to play around with. they have this pure motivation, that make them really investable, and easy to root for. although some of the supporting characters can go underdeveloped, they were still a huge asset to the film, and they all came to play ball!  the screenplay by steve kloves was pretty well written overall, besides some of the parts and characters that went underdeveloped. he adapted this nice mythical speech style, that worked really well with the setting and plot! the comedy was really well balanced, and interwoven into this, sometimes darker toned film. steve kloves worked really well with j.k. rowling to craft this script, and they made more than a handful of memorable quotes, that will just stick aroun with you forever!  the creative team created tremendous potential with a new world, that opens doors to endless opportunities! the production design looks absolutely beautiful! the creative team utilized so many great set pieces, while having so many great practical costumes and makeup to go along with this amazing world.  it's understandable that the magic isn't all there yet, but i would've liked a little more, with some conflict, to give the film more risks. columbus had the perfect opportunity to add a lot of stakes, because of the kids inexperience, but the creative team didn't quite jump on it. one of the bigger issues of the film, is the effects. they weren't terrible at the time, but they don't hold up that well, and the creative team carried themselves like they created seamless work.  the score is one of the biggest success this film has. john williams is a master composer, and he easily crafted one of the most known scores in cinema! the score adds so much depth and intensity to every scene that it's in!  overall, harry potter and the sorcerer's stone will always have a special place in my heart, but it has room for improvement.",positive

No Name,3.5,"this first film in the blockbuster franchise was one of my favorite films growing up, but does it hold up in 2020, or is it blind nostalgia? i'd say it mostly holds up but there are things that i didn't notice when i was younger, it has its issues so let's dissect this film a little bit. chris columbus makes such a fun and believable world that you desperately want it to be real, magic is seen as an amazing wonder in this movie and you are pleasantly surprised by it as you discover this whole magical world for the first time with harry potter. john williams' score goes without saying, it is very magical, not just because it makes you truly feel the magic people are using, but because it is so fitting and emotional, he is the greatest cinematic composer of all time and this is one of his absolute best scores. the casting and performances were all perfect, the young leads surprised me and i cared about them, but alan rickman as snape was amazing, i love his character and his presence just makes you feel depressed, this was by far his best role, narrowly beating hans gruber. i always enjoy the dursleys, no matter how cruel they are to harry, and richard griffiths is the most underrated actor in the series. the production design and practical effects are top-notch in quality and it helps make you feel like this world exists with these creatures and the beautiful hogwarts castle. this film is not without issues though as i have several that i noticed upon rewatch. this film is long and slow, it is drawn out because this needs to do a substantial amount of world-building and it is also an origin story for all three of our leads; i understand why they did this, but they could've taken out maybe ten minutes, or at least replaced it with more plot development, this film definitely drags at times and not a lot of time is devoted to the overall plot or the antagonist of this movie. i did not care about quirrell at all and thought that he was a wasted character who should've been more important considering he was the main villain, not a lot of time was given to the actual sorcerers stone either, we didn't get to fully understand why it was such a coveted item and it feels more like a half baked sub-plot. the camera at times gives some weird angles and tracking shots which i've never noticed before. the full-body cgi is very noticeable and terrible, especially when compared to the amazing practical effects. back to the positives though, i really enjoyed the forbidden forest sequence, it was dark dreary in tone which was refreshing from this happy go lucky, magic is awesome tone that is present in the rest of the film. quidditch is by far my favorite thing in the wizarding world and the match in this movie is so exciting and viceral, you really wish that it was real and that you could see the amazing sport in real life. this film was a pretty good start to this epic franchise, though most of its problems have to do with pacing, bad cgi, a weak antagonist, and a main plot that was sidelined during the first half of the film and rushed through in the second half. the great acting from everyone, a decent script, columbus' sure direction, and great makeup and production design paired along with great performances from our young leads and memorable side characters make this a pretty good movie and a solid start to the franchise.",positive

No Name,5.0,"harry potter and the sorcerer's stone is about a young boy whose parents died when he was an infant. after his parents are killed, he has to move in with his aunt and uncle who hate him. they treat him terribly just because the aunt didn't like his sister for one specific reason. this reason is that harry's parents are both wizards, meaning that they can use magic and spells and other magical things. a man named hagrid comes to get harry so that he can attend hogwarts, the school of witchcraft and wizardry. this is when harry finds out that he is a wizard and that there is a normal world and a wizarding world. harry then attends this school and meets friends and they all have to figure out the mystery behind the sorcerer's stone.  	i am someone who is very into the harry potter series. this movie, harry potter and the sorcerer's stone is an excellent movie. it puts mystery, adventure, and fun all into one film. i enjoy how the movie explains the characters backgrounds well. it makes it more interesting that we know that harry's parents were killed and how they were killed. it also makes the plot more interesting that harry's aunt and uncle hate him so much and that they keep him being a wizard a secret from him because they don't want him to end up like his aunt's sister, his mom. this brings up another factor of this movie that i appreciate, the character development. 	throughout the movie, we learn a lot about all of the different characters. we learn about harry's best friend, ron weasley's background. about how he has a huge family, goes to hogwarts, and is also kind of squeamish, but also brave. we also learn about harry's enemy, draco malfoy. draco is a very mean and hostile boy that also goes to hogwarts. he tries to make harry's life adjustment as bad as he possibly can. this balance of people that are good to harry and bad to him are what makes the film and its plot more interesting for the viewers, like me, to watch.  	another reason to enjoy this movie is because of its setting. the movie starts out in the normal human world. i think this was important to include because it shows how much adjusting harry potter had to do when he went to the wizarding world. when he was introduced to the wizarding world you could tell that he was a little overwhelmed in the beginning, but as time went on it became his new home. i think that putting harry in a wizarding school was a great choice to do. this way, harry would be forced to learn how to use his wizarding abilities and have to interact with other wizards his age. this all makes the plot amusing and leaves the viewers wanting to keep watching. all in all, i think that this movie has many good features to it which makes me recommend others to watch.",positive

No Name,4.0,"the best word to describe this movie is magic. whenever i watch this movie, i get fully sucked in to the wizarding world of harry potter and forget everything, something no other harry potter movie did. john williams's score is simply magnificent and underscores every scene brilliantly, the sets for hogwarts, diagon alley and gringotts are brilliant, the casting is perfect. actors like alan rickman, richard harris and maggie smith portrays the characters brilliantly and it adapts the book so well. every character and location is exactly how i describe it and there are so many great moments like the entire 3rd act, the quidditch match, the mirror of erised scene, our first look at hogwarts and many more. chris columbus put so much passion into this movie. i laughed, i cried, i was scared, it's everything i wanted and it exceeds the already excellent book. the child acting and cgi is not the best however and since the first book is my personal least favorite one, it also has to suffer from not the best source material but this movie will always hold a specual place in my heart (a-)",positive

No Name,3.5,"the potter movie that started it all.  disclaimer: i never grew up on the harry potter series nor have i read the books. so my review may be biased.  this film is an introduction to the cultural phenomenon surrounding the harry potter universe. with book-to-movie adaptations, there are many things that can go astray. yet philosopher's stone seems to capture the wonderment and childhood terror that makes the series a cross-generational classic.  also kudos to the actors. radcliffe, grint, watson, et al. gave a stellar performance that charms audiences around the world.  it's a charming firm, lighthearted, and whimsical. there's a ton of world-building that lets audiences' imaginations run wild. the film itself is an impressive watch. even if the cgi seems a bit dated at some places... but is that a fair critique for a 19 y/o film?  personally, one complaint i had was how fast time seemed to move in this film. we move from month to month rather disorientingly. but you try compressing a school year in a single 2-hour movie.  the other complaint was based on how things seemed to happen too perfectly for harry. but i understand that is the book's fault & not the movie's.  3.5/5. great to watch with family and friends.",positive
No Name,5.0,"harry potter is a brilliant series, and this film is a brilliant introduction to that.",positive
No Name,5.0,"a charming introduction to the wizarding world of harry potter!  chris columbus' children's fantasy adventure film harry potter and the philosopher's stone (2001) is a dreamy fantasy picture that will make you want to attend hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. i loved growing up with these movies as a child, now as an adult, i appreciate their delightful filmmaking and storytelling all the more. richard francis-bruce edits this movie with such a natural pace that time flies by with a new quaint scenario of magic every scene. columbus set a new standard for family entertainment by creating all this cinematic iconography with his greatest film: harry potter and the philosopher's stone. it is pure joy for 152 magical minutes of childhood nostalgia.  j. k. rowling's writing is like stepping into the magical fantasy world of wizards and witches that we all dreamed of casting spells and going to far away places. she understands the perspective of children desiring more from life, whether she writes about family, friends, love, adventure, travel, or courage in the face of adversity. rowling invented an entire magical universe all her own that i'm forever grateful for her mind. harry potter and the philosopher's stone is a delightful family movie that remains a personal favorite of mine to this day.  harry potter famously found the most talented child actors around with natural performances, nice chemistry, and genuinely heartfelt emotions. daniel radcliffe is incredibly sympathetic and likable as the eager, yet shy harry potter. rupert grint is hilarious as the endearing poor fool ron weasley. emma watson was born to play hermione granger with her quick wits and adorable charm. she plays hermione more smug initially until she warms up to the boys and their adventurous spirit. tom felton is perfectly cast as the villainous bully draco malfoy. his name even means bad guy, so you know felton had this in the bag with his smug face and elitist attitude as draco. he lets you know malfoy is wealthy and comes from a long line of money and isn't afraid to cheat his way to the top. he's a phenomenally hateable antagonist and memorable character.  richard harris is so kind and gentle as the formidable wizard headmaster albus dumbledore in all his flowing robes and magnificent beard. he sounds so soothing and knowledgeable that i think harris' serene and kindly dumbledore is my favorite incarnation of j. k. rowling's iconic wizard character. maggie smith is gleefully stern as the brilliant witch minerva mcgonagall. harry potter is simply her best acting. robbie coltrane is hilarious and sweet as the lovable giant rubeus hagrid. alan rickman is phenomenal as severus snape with his wicked wit and morbidly serious tone. rickman is so fun as professor snape because of the look of disdain he puts on so well. richard griffiths is very fun as harry potter's mean uncle vernon dursley alongside fiona shaw's wicked aunt petunia dursley. ian hart is interesting as the timid and stuttering professor quirrell.  i must mention the legendary actor sir john hurt cameos as the nice wand merchant garrick ollivander in the most mystifying scene in harry potter when harry chooses his wand. hurt captures an air of mystery and warmth that you will believe in magic!  other excellent supporting roles of note are david bradley as the sadistic groundskeeper mr. filch with his cute cat mrs. norris. matthew lewis as the cowardly neville longbottom. warwick davis as the bank teller goblin and filius flitwick. verne troyer as griphook is scary and neat. harry melling is such a jerk as dudley dursley. john cleese is funny as nearly headless nick like julie walters is kind as ron's mother molly weasley. you can even see a cute young bonnie wright as ron's little sister ginny weasley at the train station!  chris columbus' charming direction is what makes harry potter and the philosopher's stone so charming. you want to visit these magical places in an enchanted english countryside as it all looks real. the production design is mysterious, dusty, warm, and quaintly inviting. the practical effects are mixed carefully with excellent for the era cgi, where a talking snake looks real as does many magic spells. the only green screen that's noticeable is the backgrounds while students fly on brooms and the troll. even the sorting hat still looks cool.  judianna makovsky and graham churchyard's costumes are already iconic from dumbledore's robes, snape's suit and cloak, to the gryffindor scarves. clare le vesconte's make-up is inspired with crazy choices for goblins and wizards alike. john williams' score is so pleasant that you can never forget his theme songs for harry potter. he carefully composed each piece for each scene as the notes are cues for particular moments on screen for magical emphasis. he outdid himself with one of his most beloved and memorable scores within his illustrious career as a composer.  columbus brings his usual christmas spirit and child's playful attitude alongside his resplendent directorial choices. the scary sequences are dark and mysterious, while various payoffs are cleverly established earlier up with clever framing and sequencing on his part. his swift and imaginative direction transcends time and age as he crafted a wonderful feature for all ages. john seale's striking cinematography captures wide shots of hogwarts castle, dark foggy forests, hidden chambers, and brightly lit halls with equal grace. seale's close-ups are iconic and very expressive.  in conclusion, chris columbus directed a classic film with harry potter and the philosopher's stone with his creative direction, williams' legendary score, and a cool cast of talented kids.",positive

No Name,4.5,"review: ‚Äòharry potter and the philosopher's stone' is a fantasy film directed by chris columbus.  it is based on the novel of the same name by j. k. rowling and is the film is the first instalment of the harry potter film series. this movie is so well done, and to me seems like it was ahead of its time.  harry potter (daniel radcliffe) has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life. but on his 11th birthday, he learns he's a powerful wizard -- with a place waiting for him at the hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. as he learns to harness his newfound powers with the help of the school's kindly headmaster (richard harris), harry uncovers the truth about his parents' deaths -- and about the villain who's to blame. i would say that the casting of the film is perfect. the kids, daniel radcliffe, rupert grint, emma watson, tom felon just to name a few are fantastic. they steal your heart and every scene they are in. also, the other cast like richard harris, maggie smith, alan rickman and robbie coltrane make their characters likable. sometimes the visuals are better than others, but it was good for being made in 2001. the film has a big runtime, but the script is so tight it feels like it blows by. overall, anyone who loves fantasy films and worlds with great visuals, this film is for you. i go back to this movie all the time, and i highly recommend it. 4.5/5",positive

No Name,2.5,"this is now the 8th time i've seen harry potter and the philosopher's stone and i can say that i doesn't hold up as well as i remembered it.  harry potter and the philosopher's stone is the first film in the harry potter saga. the film was directed by chris columbus who also directed home alone. the film stars daniel radcliffe as harry potter, emma watson as hermione granger and rupert grint as ron weasley.  the acting is good for the most part, but a few of the children actors feel off a lot of the time. daniel radcliffe was fine, but he felt like he was phoning it in a lot of the time.  the characters i felt were strong and memorable, but in my opinion i think that harry potter is one of the most overrated and annoying characters from successful book/film history.  the cinematography was sound with some very good shots of the characters and scenery.  the settings of the film are quiet strong ranging from a train station to hogwarts  the famous magical school.  the set design and props i thought were some of the best things within the film from the building designs to the various magical items.   the costume design and makeup was also strong especially with robbie coltrane as rubeus hagrid and richard harris as professor albus dumbledore.  the style of the film is sound from the colour scheme to the settings, but i felt that with the budget they could've made it more colourful.  the practical effects from the makeup to the stunts were done well, but the special effects i felt have aged really badly. some times it would look fine, but at other times the cgi looks so laughably bad.  the film also had some action toward the end which i felt was pulled off quiet well.  the score of the film in my opinion is very strong and memorable. the other music was also good, but not as memorable.  the film also had some comedy which i felt wasn't bad but not good. i only laughed twice within the film and both moments involved hagrid.  i did have quiet a lot of complaints with the film from some of the rules to the film feeling slow and off at points.  one of the better things within the film was hagrid. i felt that they used his size very well unlike some other movies with bigger characters.   the film i enjoyed, but i wouldn't say that i would watch it over most other movies.  over all i give it a  5/10 56% 2.8/5  memorable, but disappointing",negative

No Name,5.0,"it may sound odd to refer to ""the two towers"" as underrated, but it is all relatively speaking. for some reason, of the original trilogy, this one gets the least amount of love. as of writing this review it is the lowest ranked on imdb ( #14 on the top 250, where the other two are in the top 10). it won only 2 oscars, where the first won 4 and the final won 11. so, i'm not sure whether this is an unpopular opinion or not, but this is my favorite lord of the rings movie.  to a certain degree, i can understand why it's comparatively ignored. the first one begins the grand adventure, the third concludes it in grand fashion and the second just continues the story set up in the first. but this one introduces so many of the staples that would come to be synonymous with the series. this is where andy serkis as golem really gets to shine. characters like wormtail, treebeard, eowyn and carl urban are introduced. the action in this one is the best of the trilogy. the battle for helm's deep is thrilling, creative, huge and epic. the battle might go for about 40 minutes of runtime, but it never feels repetitive. you're rooting for these characters to succeed against all odds.  unlike the first movie, since the fellowship has broken up into smaller groups, the movie is able to cut between each of their side-adventures. there is not a side adventure in the movie that i don't find engaging, they are all interesting to watch. these multiple stories also help with the pacing of the movie. it feels like peter jackson was making an extra effort to have the story move at a quicker pace. the movie is a minute longer than the first, but it feels much shorter and easier to watch.  it makes sense, where the first movie takes time to get started and the third takes time to wrap up, the second can spend all its time in the adventure. and what a grand adventure it is. of all the trilogy this is the one i can rewatch the most. the middle chapter of middle earth is the best of the best.",positive

No Name,4.5,this film is a wonderful second edition to the trilogy. the acting is still top notch. the world created by jackson is engaging and vast. some areas seem to drag a bit but are investments for later on in the movie. i recommend the extended edition which added important and fun scenes. this is my least favorite out of the three but that does not say much since they are all masterpieces.,positive

No Name,4.5,"the two towers is a great movie. is it as good as the other two films in the trilogy? i personally don't think so. i found myself less invested in some of the story elements, particularly when they involved the human characters (which occupied much of the runtime). though not as strong as fellowship or rotk, this movie is full of spectacular moments.   the battle of helm's deep might be the best battle in cinematic history. from the driving force to the action to the gravitas, everything about that sequence is jaw-dropping. though incredibly dark and serious, the humor is spot-on and adds a needed layer of character development.   on top of the action, what this movie does well is develop relationships between characters. frodo and sam, legolas and gimli, frodo and sm√©agol, aragorn and √©owyn, and beyond. the relationships in this film are superb and help push the story forward.   when i want to watch incredible action and the lord of the rings: the two towers is a great movie in an amazing trilogy.   best character: gimli best moment: the battle of helm's deep (the entire thing) best quote: ""toss me."" - gimli",positive
No Name,5.0,"the lord of the rings: the two towers, is an amazing movie that perfectly combines epic battles and emotional moments. the battle of helm's deep is intense and exciting, and the characters, especially frodo, sam, and gollum, have a lot of depth that really makes you care about them. gollum, played by andy serkis, is especially impressive and feels like a real character despite being cgi. the visuals are beautiful, and the music by howard shore makes everything even more epic. with its themes of friendship and hope, this movie is a must-watch and definitely deserves five stars.",positive

No Name,4.0,"because of the chronology of the story, so much of the book two towers has to be moved to rotk. as such, there's a lot of filler that just seems like padding in the extended edition.   yet, my last watch of the theatrical felt like a rushed mess that didn't take any time to let moments be digested.  the technical marvels still on display all these years later hold up. the performances are strong (though the character development is muted).  helms deep remains one of the greatest battles; gollum still scintillates; bernard hill gives theoden a tragic majesty.  one version moving too quickly, another version too padded without significant dedication to character development; the two towers still remains an essential watch being part of the greatest examples of filmmaking one will ever see.",positive

No Name,5.0,"""the lord of the rings: the two towers""**  *the two towers*, the second film in *the lord of the rings* trilogy, stands as my personal favorite, not only within the trilogy but also as a cinematic experience in its own right. the film, directed by peter jackson, takes the momentum built by *the fellowship of the ring* and propels it to new heights, blending intense action, deep character development, and stunning visual storytelling.  what makes *the two towers* remarkable is its seamless juggling of multiple storylines, each as engaging as the other. frodo and sam‚Äôs perilous journey toward mordor, guided by the treacherous yet pitiable gollum, presents a tense and psychological exploration of the corrupting power of the ring. andy serkis‚Äô performance as gollum, enhanced by groundbreaking motion capture technology, is nothing short of revolutionary. gollum‚Äôs internal conflict, brilliantly captured in the ""two personalities"" scene, adds a complex layer to the narrative, deepening the themes of duality and inner struggle.  meanwhile, aragorn, legolas, and gimli‚Äôs pursuit of the uruk-hai who captured merry and pippin brings us into the heart of rohan, where the movie's epic scale truly begins to unfold. the introduction of rohan‚Äôs people, particularly king th√©oden (played by bernard hill), √©owyn (miranda otto), and √©omer (karl urban), enriches the political and emotional stakes of the war. theoden's journey from a king ensnared by despair to a leader reclaiming his courage is one of the most powerful arcs in the film.  of course, *the two towers* is perhaps most famous for the battle of helm‚Äôs deep, a masterclass in large-scale battle sequences. the sense of tension and desperation builds as the seemingly unstoppable forces of saruman‚Äôs uruk-hai assault the fortress, culminating in a heroic last stand that feels both intimate and epic. jackson‚Äôs ability to make every moment of the battle feel personal, whether it‚Äôs aragorn rallying the troops or legolas and gimli‚Äôs friendly competition, makes this sequence an emotional high point.  one of the film‚Äôs strengths is its ability to maintain a balance between spectacle and character. despite the large-scale action, it never loses sight of the personal struggles of each character. frodo‚Äôs growing weariness, sam‚Äôs unshakeable loyalty, and aragorn‚Äôs inner conflict about his destiny all serve as emotional anchors, making the stakes of the war deeply personal for the audience.   howard shore‚Äôs score once again shines, with new musical motifs that perfectly capture the majesty of rohan and the ominous presence of saruman‚Äôs forces. the music elevates the emotional resonance of key scenes, from the sorrowful laments in edoras to the triumphant arrival of gandalf and the riders of rohan at helm‚Äôs deep.  for me, *the two towers* excels because it takes the themes introduced in *the fellowship of the ring* and intensifies them, exploring the price of heroism, the weight of choices, and the bonds of friendship in a world descending into war. it‚Äôs a film that perfectly balances darkness and hope, showcasing not just the epic scope of tolkien‚Äôs world, but also the intimate human struggles within it.  ultimately, *the two towers* is a thrilling, emotionally rich experience that stands out as the most engaging and powerful entry in the trilogy. it‚Äôs a film i return to frequently, and each viewing only deepens my admiration for its intricate storytelling, unforgettable characters, and epic vision.",positive

No Name,5.0,"spoiler warning this movie is incredible and my personal favorite movie of all time (tied with the other two in the trilogy). there is so much to love in this movie so i summed it all up with this one scene.   remember the great stories, mr. frodo this scene fills me with motivation even in the darkest of times. after frodo is corrupted by the ring and is mentally forced to kill samwise on the dark outskirts of mordor, frodo has lost all hope and doubts whether he should keep going or not. however, samwise reminds him of the great stories, when heroes kept going even when times were tough and all looked lost. as samwise's speech echoes onto the renowned battle of helm's deep and the flooding of isengard, frodo starts to realize that, even if it is but a tiny sliver, there is hope.  what makes this scene so emotional is that this happens to almost everyone. there will be a point in your life when you feel like nothing is left, and this scene is a beautiful reminder of why there is always a future no matter the circumstances. you are capable of so much and any human can push through anything, it just takes true will to do so.  this scene concludes the movie in spectacular fashion as things look bright for the battle of helm's deep and our heroes go on to continue their journey. my eyes fill with tears every time i hear samwise the brave talking over howard shore's beautiful score. this scene also portrays true brotherhood and that you can lift anyone (including yourself) up just with some positive thinking.  in conclusion, this film is a breathtaking masterpiece that serves as an amazing build up to the grand finale. i feel like every individual scene had heart and soul put into it and has a valid reason for why it's there. this movie also has deeper themes of brotherhood, perseverance and addiction. i highly recommend viewing this incredible trilogy as it represents what makes us human and what we are capable of.",positive
No Name,5.0,"my favorite of all 3 installments of the trilogy. the two towers will take you into a roller coaster of emotions. it is exciting, funny and emotional. the battle scenes are out of this world. the epic entrances of heroes are the best i have ever seen in any movie ever. it has everything: from funny moments to screams of excitement and boo-hoo crying your eyes out.   the two towers mostly concentrates on rohan and saruman, while frodo and sam embark on their own journey. it is fascinating to see the film develop and how the stories (like the fellowship) are supporting one another, even unknowingly.  there is just a level of perfection to this movie that it is impossible to surpass. peter jackson set a standard that is just unfair to measure other directors.",positive

No Name,4.5,"what a great sequel that's all i can say that this is definitely a sequel. this is definitely a movie that you have to watch the first one to know what's going on in the second one and i think the book was like that too so throughout the movie, the first act started out with a clear mission from the first movie to get to modor, also, there's another plot line with aragorn and the rest of his friends that might play out in the third movie as well but the main thing that i really like about this movie is the third act usually third acts begin with a little slow burn and then build up to a final battle this third act in my opinion starts with the battle and finishes with the battle. and this movie is called the two towers which i can't really see the other tower but that's fine because i was fully entertained. this definitely works as a sequel. usually i like movies to  work as their own movie and a sequel but this definitely works as a sequel that you have to watch the first one to get this. the best character in this movie is a aragorn and gollum and gollum steals to sing for me because he's so twisted and crazy that is very entertaining overall battles are straight up entertaining, the characters were the same as the first one and overall i can't wait for the finale not better than the first one in my opinion but really damn good 9/10",positive

No Name,5.0,"this has the advantage of hitting the ground running, but, like most middle episodes, if seen in isolation would be without a start or a finish. jackson's staggering achievement is to bring tolkein's material to life in an epic way, whilst retaining a clear understanding of the dense narrative and dynamic settings and cultures. the cast is excellent and approach their roles with genuine authority. the visuals are amongst the finest ever seen in cinema, whilst the action set-pieces continue to dazzle. the finale battle for helm's deep is jaw-dropping in its delivery. at three hours the film still manages to grip the viewer throughout and skillfully sets up its audience for the final segment.",positive

No Name,5.0,"i grew up with tolkien from reading him in grade school. i am an old man now. throughout the years, i have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of lor imagery and art. it was mostly in your head. this was before the dungeons and dragons explosion. peter jackson did an excellent version of these books. the characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. the introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. i wished jackson had carried all this quality into the hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts. but that said, these 3 lor movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many, many years to come.",positive

No Name,5.0,"timeless movie! words can't even begin to describe how in love i am with this next chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. the characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. peter jackson is a complete genius! even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to gandalf after his fall in the mines of moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for middle earth as the one ring is taken closer to mordor and mount doom, can frodo and sam really trust gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the fellowship of the ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the kingdom of rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. if you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and i will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, legolas still for me and aragorn still for my sister. even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from elijah wood to sean aston to billy boyd to ian mchellen to orlando bloom to viggo mortenson to miranda otto to bernard hill to christopher lee to liv tyler to john rhys-davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with peter jackson behind the whole wheel. after seeing the fellowship of the ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old i get? no, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!",positive

No Name,5.0,"my personal favourite of the trilogy i do love all three films of the lord of the rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. the two towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. for one thing it is less talky than fellowship of the ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. and some of the characters are developed more here than they were in fellowship of the ring primarily frodo and aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.  when it comes to the scope the two towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. the cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. you can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. the music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. people may disagree, but i think the two towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.  the acting is very good. elijah wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while sean astin's bumbling persona suits sam really well. viggo mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. ian mckellen, christopher lee and bernard hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is gollum. here gollum is designed superbly, and andy serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and oscar-nod worthy.  in conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10",positive

No Name,5.0,"""the lord of the rings: the two towers"" is an incredible movie realised by peter jackson. it's a fantasy film. he was written by peter jackson and fran walsh. the soundtrack was composed by howard shore. the film was realised in 2002. the main actors are elijah wood, viggo mortensen and ian mckellen.  ""the two towers"" follows the continuing quest of frodo and the fellowship to destroy the one ring. frodo and sam discover they are being followed by the mysterious gollum. aragorn, the elf archer legolas, and gimli the dwarf encounter the besieged rohan kingdom, whose once great king theoden has fallen under saruman's deadly spell. ""the two towers"" received 75 nominations, 65 wins with 6 academy awards.  the acting is realistic and outstanding. the screenplay is very enigmatic and entertaining. i find the soundtrack beautiful and gripping. the atmosphere is epic and manipulative.   for me, this film is a truly great piece of filmmaking. also, i give this film a 5 !",positive
No Name,5.0,completely outstanding movie! the writing is excellently done and the stakes have gone up drastically from the first installment.,positive
No Name,5.0,"this is my favorite of the trilogy. i love how they divided the characters up so that they can grow stronger relationships with one another. and also making them the focus and we focus on how they grow, change, and become more likeable. it's a little harder to grow your characters when they are all together. some movies succeed at that and some fail. but peter jackson played a genius move by having them split up in order to focus on some more. there is more action in this one and i loved that. the battle for helms deep wasn't just a minute and i liked that because it's a big thing that happened. and i was intrigued through and through. gollum i think was properly introduced in this movie. the adventure advanced really well compared to the others. the other movies have great adventure but i like this one a little more. if i had to critique one thing, i think they spent a little to much time with rohan. some of it was engaging but after a while i think they should've moved on. in the first movie it made sense because they had to help the king but after a while i felt like they should've moved on. the acting was great and i think if you loved the first you'll love this one.",positive
No Name,5.0,always going to be the best in my book!,positive
No Name,5.0,"i can't believe i am just now finding out about this series, it is so amazing!",positive
No Name,5.0,this is my favorite in the trilogy!,positive
No Name,5.0,absolute masterpiece <3,positive
No Name,5.0,"two towers did a fantastic job following up fellowship. this movie separates our ring bearing group and allows them to have their own journeys simultaneously, and juggles it well. near perfect movie and great 2nd part of the greatest trilogy of all time!",positive
No Name,5.0,"the two towers is still an absolutely fantastic movie and is nearly perfect, but i think that fellowship of the ring is just a little bit better.  gollum is obviously an absolute scene stealer every single time that he is on screen.  the final battle in helm's deep is grand and fantastical as well as emotional and sometimes comedic.  just an overall amazing film and a great follow-up to the first.",positive
No Name,4.5,"although all three of the movies are really good, two towers is still my third favorite one. it's still a very good film. in many aspects, it improves upon the first film. there are obvious new characters and locations, there is much more cgi and the battle scenes get much bigger. the battle of helm's deep is just truly epic and well choreographed.  i must say, gollum is exceptional. he was a huge technical achievement in 2002. his character is meant to be a villain, yet he is very sympathetic. and yes, ""my precious!"" is one of the best lines of this century. the two towers also has all the qualities that make up most good second films in a trilogy. it ends in a point where the heroes are at danger or have lost. this will make their victory in the final movie much stronger. frodo and sam are in danger by the end as they have teamed up with an untrustworthy ally, gollum.  honestly it is very hard to compare all the three movies and everyone might have their favorite because all three of them are amazing. even though this is the weaker one it is still one of the best films of the 2000s. it really shows what a great trilogy this is. everything great about the first film is still there here which is part of what makes it such a good sequel.",positive
No Name,5.0,best trilogy of all time!!!,positive
No Name,4.5,"the scope gets bigger, the stakes are higher, in other words, the spectacular second part grants a thrilling viewing experience. it just flows perfectly and it never stops; it benefits so much from the long runtime. the epic battle of helms deep tops the movie exquisitely, setting the bar high for the final.",positive
No Name,5.0,"i think this holds the #3 spot of the trilogy only because it is the bridge b/w the beginning and the end... obviously still an amazing movie, highly recommend!!!",positive
No Name,4.5,"best of the trilogy (but not by a long shot). mostly because of andy serkis, we saw a darn lot of him in this movie and it was completely necessary for this films success. i highly recommend  watching the two part extended version. trust me, once you watch it, you will never want to watch the original again.",positive
No Name,5.0,"the most underrated film in the trilogy, simply because the others are so good. it is a testament to the series' quality that the movie containing the battle of helm's deep is the least beloved.",positive
No Name,5.0,great spectacular of a film great battle scenes my favourite of the trilogy  . great cast,positive
No Name,5.0,"the second installment in the lord of the rings franchise proves just as, if not more, incredible than fellowship.  andy serkis, elijah wood, and sean astin are enthralling as the three hobbits (one heroic, one corrupted, and one working in the direction of the latter), and ian mckellan and viggo mortensen outshine nearly every other performance in the history of cinema.  epic battles and heartfelt dialogue capture the exact reason that i go to watch movies.",positive
No Name,5.0,"probably my favourite of the trilogy, the battle scenes and storyline with all the characters, outstanding and watched 20+ times.. can't go wrong",positive
No Name,5.0,best trilogy ever!!!,positive
No Name,5.0,"perhaps of the best movie of all time, this movie has so much character development, so much good scenery and so much good in general. the battle scene is the best battle scene you shall ever see, there is absolutely nothing to complain about. no flaws. this movie should be 100% rating. another point: this movie changes barely anything from the beloved books. great movie",positive
No Name,5.0,peak filmmaking - just an unbelievable experience that can‚Äôt be contained in the screen and bursts out into the room.,positive
No Name,4.5,"amazing film again. slight, just slight drop off compared to the other two films. but fantastic battle scenes and battle of helms deep was amazing. great character development of frodo, sam, gollum etc. slower paced at the beginning to get the story set up properly. but still amazing.",positive

No Name,4.5,"number two, lets get it!  wow this cinematography. i mean wow. it is so simple yet so gorgeous and the colors always match so perfectly in every scene. a marvelous film to look at and very admirable camera work across the board. the transitions in-between scenes, the shift in colors, my word it's gorgeous. i can't stop saying that, this cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.  the vfx are stunning! gollem is horrifying and the moving trees look so real‚Ä¶ something hard to come by when you're making an inanimate object a living being.  and can we talk about this acting?? not really from legolas‚Ä¶ but everyone else is soooo good. i love the characters of aragorn and gimli. phenomenal actors (viggo in specific) and great characters that they're portraying!  the goosebumps that this score gives me is unmatched by any other ost. like it is just so beautiful and intense and i love it, i could listen to it forever.  there are quite a few times where i found myself sitting there during a conversation wondering what in the world did this add to the story? and most of them, the answer is nothing. no wonder the film is 3 hours long!  short review on this one. loved all the action, loved the music and the dramatic camera work. far surpasses the first. insanely excited for the return of the king!  is it really a fight scene if there's not a wilhelm scream? so unnecessary yet so crucial.",positive
No Name,5.0,rather fabulous. one of the very greatest movies of all time. i suspect this will be one of the most watched movies again as fans cleanse their soul from amazon.,positive

No Name,0.5,"bit of a nonsense really, suits under 12s. poor plot points, horrible acting, and unnecessary scenes dropped in.",negative
No Name,5.0,simply the best movie !,positive
No Name,5.0,"though not as good as the original, ""the two towers"" is still a masterpiece that continues the journey of frodo, sam, aragorn, etc. with much more at stake, introducing new and memorable characters that are played perfectly due to the outstanding casting choices. the ending is very emotional, and ends off on yet another cliffhanger that keeps viewers excited to see the conclusion.",positive
No Name,4.0,not often does a trilogy hold up so well,positive
No Name,5.0,"the story continues as frodo and sam reluctantly ally with villian gollum, (andy serkis in a cgi-fied but brilliant performance) aragorn and the others get unexpected new allies, a beloved character returns from the dead, and an epic battle at the helms deep stronghold (complete with rain) takes place. plus a skateboarding elf, and a cocky dwarf have an orc killing contest. it‚Äôs a really great second film, though it gets overlooked sometimes compared to the first and the third films.",positive

No Name,5.0,"in comparison to the other two lotr movies it lacks a bit of moment...the adaptation from the books is less good than in the first movie, the epicness and emotional impact less than in the thirs movie. still one of the greatest movies ever due to the impossibly good scenes/sets, the great story-writing and acting and the effects",negative
No Name,4.0,"filme extremamente bom, por√©m para mim esse fica um pouco arrastado.",negative
No Name,5.0,one of the best movies of all time,positive
No Name,5.0,second greatest film of all time. just behind fellowship of the ring.,positive
No Name,5.0,"the strengths of the first movie didn't necessarily carry over to this one, but it was still fantastic in its own right with its own set of attributes that made it so. most notable by far were the film score, arguably the most memorable of the three movies, followed by the introduction of gollum and the revolutionary cgi quality that came with him. the flaws in this one have the benefit of being made much worse by their expansion in the third movie, that being the deus ex machina and frodo's transformation into a burdensome wuss, and even those could be considered more a gripe with the source material than the actual filmmakers. the final battle is truly something to behold here, both for its obvious high quality and for the endless series of lotr videogames with levels based on it.",positive
No Name,4.5,"[‚≠êÔ∏è89%]  the second movie in the lord of the rings franchise, the two towers (2002) maintains the same quality as its predecessor as well as expanding upon it in other places such as the world and creatures.  as the fellowship is broken, the remaining former members are separated into smaller groups which actually allows for some development for characters, whether they are important like aragorn or more of a side character like pippin.  the two towers (2002) actually offers a lot more greater things than the fellowship of the ring (2001) with diving deeper into themes about the hypnosis the ring provides as well as some huge scale battles, however the pace is a lot slower and more dialogue heavy than its predecessor, which at points can be really long to sit through.  other than it's slower pace, the lord of the rings: the two towers (2002) provides yet another fantastic addition to the trilogy.",positive
No Name,0.5,half a star cause of sm√©agol‚Ä¶..,negative
No Name,4.0,"now this is how you make a sequel. the two towers not only gets us more invested with our characters. but adds more that are also likeable. it cranks up the action, the special effects, and story to make us want to know how it ends.",positive

Michael C,5.0,"the two towers will always be worth a watch. the star cast of knighted sirs, ian mckellen, chris lee, elijah wood are all so emotive and brilliant. the picturesque imagery and raw evocative emotions of the human race are so beautifully portrayed and it deserved every single last oscar it won.",positive
No Name,5.0,"you can get better then the lord of the rings the two towers. the battle scenes are intense, entertaining and incredibly done, and the story is shown beautifully and extremely entertaining! i promise you you wont regret watching this movie! a must see. 100%",positive
No Name,4.5,"the two towers is probably my favourite of the books and the film is also fantastic. certain aspects are done perfectly; fangorn forest and the ents could not be better, and nor could the character of gollum. scenes involving gollum are certainly the best in the movie. other performances are also about as excellent as they could possibly be. main negative is that some of the battle scenes (particularly the one at helm's deep) go on longer than they need to. the aragorn and arwen scenes are really cringe, but i suppose they have to be there.",negative

No Name,4.5,"split between frodo and sam on one hand and aragorn, legolas, and gimli on the other, there can be a bit of a pacing issue here. frodo and sam's side can be a little more boring, but there's certainly enough to keep you interested. sure, it can be dark, like its predecessor, but there's also triumph in it.",positive

No Name,5.0,best movies of all time!,positive
No Name,5.0,this is in my opinion the best lor of the rings movie. gollum is such a good character,positive
No Name,5.0,"the lord of the rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. i have already written a review for the fellowship of the ring, in which i talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. that is why i won't talk about those things in this review. rather i will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation.  percy jackson has done a really great job. the story picks up from the part where gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. this not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. while previously we believed gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. this is the reason why it paid off to see him return as gandalf the white.  the thing i really like aobut gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. in one moment he is being spun around by saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. in the first movie he scared bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the hobbits in the party. this is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. this way we get to see him from multiple perspectives.  the second character i'd talk about here would be gollum. the first time i saw him i thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (jar jar from star wars prequels, dobby from harry potter etc). but he's very different. earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. however, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. this is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. this message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself.  speaking of the scene where gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. this is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something peter jackson was able to handle. even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how gollum was feeling while planning to kill frodo and not how he was actually looking like. there have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but i don't want to spoil the movie for you.  and that scene was interrupted by sam, who is the next character i'd speak about. sam is frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure frodo is safe. he is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped frodo from wearing the ring. sam had heard that gollum wanted to kill frodo and even though gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the mountain of doom, sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. frodo didn't trust him or rather should i say, didn't want to trust him. and in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, sam never wasted any time to get back to saving frodo.  the movie also has many battle scenes, cool cgi, shows the fellowship of the ring fight alongside other kingdoms while gandalf is not there to protect them. the action, the comic timings, the cgi, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. the only mistake i made watching this was that i watched the theatrical cut of this movie. because of this i missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which i was thinking would be answered in return of the king. it has something to do with saruman. so don't make that mistake. i'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch.  the two towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and i really wish it was talked about more. only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. that doesn't mean it's bad. that just means this trilogy should be watched more. since the fellowship of the ring is the beginning of the adventures and the return of the king is the conclusion, the two towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. but in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. it is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place.",positive
No Name,5.0,"the two towers somehow improves on its predecessor. gigantic action, deep character moments, and a heaping of shakespearean dialogue. this is a movie (no, a film) for the ages.",positive
No Name,5.0,"lord of the rings: the two towers is a masterpiece. the two towers continues the story of the fellowship as they travel through the lands of rohan and the country of gondor to get to mordor to destroy the ring of power. gollum is an amazing character and getting to see both sides of him added so much more depth to his character. the uruk-hai are menacing in this movie along with saruman, he actually feels like a real threat along with his foot soldiers and you get the sense that anyone can die in all 3 of these movies, with the stakes being set at the end of fellowship. but the bar is raised as king theoden and the people of rohan retreat to helm's deep where they fight what is undeniably one of the greatest battles in cinematic history. i could go about this movie for days, but you get the point. i love it, and i always will.",positive
No Name,5.0,"(extended edition)  this one is always better than i remember it being. definitely the black sheep of the trilogy.  the extended cut isn't as good as fellowship's in my opinion as there are too many extraneous scenes in this cut that only serve to stifle the pacing. the worst offenders are the additional scenes of merry & pippin which were already the slowest parts of the theatrical cut. in this cut we get entire scenes that are utterly pointless and barely add anything, as well as some more comedically focussed scenes that seem awkward and out of place in the overall film.  there are other scenes that help flesh out and develop characters which i feel should have been included in the theatrical version. for example, we get a much better explanation of aragorn's lineage and history in this cut which is very important given the key role he plays in the plot of the return of the king.  overall, i feel the theatrical cut of this film is the superior, especially for a more casual viewer. it may gloss over some aspects, but the pacing is much better. i think i'll continue watching the extended cut though, purely because it has more content.",positive
No Name,5.0,amazing a must see clasic,positive
No Name,5.0,the epic second installment to the greatest trilogy ever created. the masterpiece of helm's deep should serve as the ultimate model for any cinematic battle for the future.,positive
No Name,4.0,"in a sense my score for this is an average between what i consider to be a 3~3.5/5 theatrical cut and a 4.5/5 extended cut, as these two versions of the movie are very, very different in terms of quality, considerably moreso than either of the other two lotr films.  the biggest problems inherent are in regards to pacing, and establishing the new characters in a way that works as well as in fellowship (which had considerably more to introduce but somehow did a far better job).  the extended cut of the two towers still doesn't do as good as fellowship (or return, for that matter) in terms of its character dynamics or its extension of world-building, but it is a vast improvement and certainly does an overall good job with both of these.  simply put, this is one of those movies (like troy & chronicles of riddick) where the extended cut's additions are so good at adding much-needed context that, despite their increased run-times, actually feel like much shorter films than their shorter versions.  like the other two, the cinematography, music, production design, sound design, acting and action-sequences are all top-notch, still effective to this day, and serious props to everyone for managing to successfully make a 45-minute action sequence that managed to keep the stakes high.  it's needed viewing to experience the whole story, and while it's the weakest of the three, it's still usually very good quality, only sometimes dipping into ""good not great"" territory from time to time.",positive
No Name,0.5,the worst of the trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,negative
No Name,4.5,the battle of helm's deep took three months to film and is quite possibly the most fantastic on-screen clash of armies ever filmed.,positive
No Name,1.0,golim looks like a cartoon character but serkis plays him well,positive
No Name,4.5,"not quite as remarkable as fellowship or return but it's still a phenomenal second chapter: the visual effects are still top notch as well as the sets, cinematography, score and costumes/makeup, the action is also a major improvement over the first with the battle of helm's deep obviously being one of the best battles in history, andy serkis gives a fantastic performance as gollum and provides us with a conflicting character that we don't know how to feel about, i also loved seeing how sauron's take over of middle earth is actually affecting middle earth as shown with the situation of rohan. the biggest issue is the pacing of the movie. it drags on in the middle for quite a lot and being the middle chapter, it lacks the setting up of the first movie or the pay off of the third movie and we don't get as many locations and we spend a bit too much time with the rohan subplot but it's still an emotional, suspenseful, satisfying and exciting second chapter with great characters and moments.",positive
No Name,4.0,"the two towers is grand in spectacle and (eventually) extremely thrilling. as much as i love this installment and the entire series, this middle entry of the series gets a bit bogged down in picking up the pieces of the first and setting up the finale to be independently spectacular. in comparison with the fellowship of the ring, the adventure is far less expansive and the protagonists being consistently split makes for a less cohesive story telling. what this movie is most famous for - the battle at helm's deep - earns its reputation and is the pinnacle of high fantasy action to date.",positive

No Name,5.0,while the weakest movie in the trilogy the two towers does a lot of heavy lifting. it's largely the most uneventful but it's still a strong middle chapter. the battle for helm's deep has a relatively slow buildup but it also effectively kicks the trilogy into a higher gear - it's so epic.,positive

No Name,4.0,"i might not have enjoyed it as much as the first film, but 'the lord of the rings: the two towers' is still a terrific film no doubt.  visually it still looks superb, i really do love the look of these films so far. the main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. there is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences.  there are, though, a few bits i found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. i found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. bernard hill. the side story, meanwhile, with billy boyd and dominic monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.  elijah wood remains good though. i did enjoy seeing the journey of frodo and sam (sean astin). andy serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! any scene with those three = outstanding.  overall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. one very much worthy of following 'the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring', despite a few 'issues' i have with it.",positive
No Name,4.0,"a step down in quality, but still good! this movie has sever pacing issues, with two of the hobbits ( the funny ones) on probably the most boring storyline ever, and the main crew following their steps in a lame detective chase for a while. once they stop that, the movie really hits its mark, and has alot of cool stuff! +1 star for aragorn being sexy",positive
No Name,5.0,just as good as the first one. this movie is just as faithful to the books as the original movie and the story gets much more dark and exciting.,positive

No Name,5.0,"this trilogy is the first novel to movie adaptation of a fantasy novel or series that has ever worked, in my opinion.  gold standard",positive
No Name,4.0,"the first film's sprawling, epic world is still in good hands! while it certainly is a step down from the fellowship of the ring, it still brings you a sense of awe. andy serkis is masterful as gollum, and the added in humor is a wise decision, making this a worthy road to the final installment. frodo and sam do not appear as much though, and the fight scenes are too plentiful to really feel excited towards the next one, because you really know who is going to win, and you wonder why the editing isn't here enough. still, i feel optimistic that the return of the king learn from its predecessors mistakes and reach a stunning victory.",positive
No Name,5.0,"the characters, story and world are incredibly put together and peter jackson has done a fantastic job adapting the books.  i didn't know anything about tolkien prior to the first in the trilogy being released so i read the hobbit in preparation. what followed over the next three years watching these films was the most memorable movie experiences i've ever had. these films brought me to tears in certain parts, something which is exceptionally rare with me as i'm not an emotional person whatsoever. i read the trilogy after and still to this day hold tolkiens world in high regard.",positive
No Name,5.0,a little weaker than the first and third instalments however it is still magnificent and one of the best films of all time. of course it's weaker state is due to the fact that it got the middle portion of the story which usually conveys more storytelling and building up rather than memorable and epic sequences.,positive
No Name,5.0,best of the lotr movies,positive
No Name,3.5,an improvement over its predecessor for sure. two towers substitutes long sequences getting to know characters for sharper action and battle sequences while adding some nice new characters to the mix. a good middle chapter,positive

No Name,5.0,"a perfect sequel, a perfect movie, and near-perfect adaptation.",positive
No Name,4.5,"though it is quite a tonal shift from the first movie and not as fast paced, it is more accurate and faithful to the source material than the fellowship of the ring's film adaptation, and the two towers definitely introduces deeper and more important chemistry between characters, so while peter jackson's first two lord of the rings movies are different in some ways, i believe that the two towers matches and maybe even exceeds the already near-flawless fellowship of the ring.",positive
No Name,5.0,"the first film sets up the world of middle earth, but the second film in the trilogy sets up higher stakes. somehow you think it‚Äôs near impossible to top yourself on a visual spectacle, but peter jackson (director) clearly got comfortable and ready to escalate. this film has one of the best battle sequences of all time in cinema. the scope is even bigger and the story just expands to new dimensions through new and old characters. gollum is a cgi masterpiece and has more depth than a normal human character would possess. once again middle earth surpasses expectations.",positive

No Name,5.0,94%. 2/24/23: amazing film. different from the first one where the group is split up into smaller groups for basically the whole film. gollum is leading frodo and sam to mordor. some more people come together for the last battle. this one is really about saruman trying to take over a fortress of men.,positive

No Name,5.0,"the lord of the rings: the two towers is honestly a brilliant sequel and it's even a masterpiece and a half. the movie's got a brilliant story, which follows on straight after the first movie and it's about frodo (elijah wood) and sam (sean astin) arriving to mordor with the help of gollum (andy serkis).  a number of new allies join their companions team to defend the well known isengard, while saruman (christopher lee) deploys an assault from his territory.  the cast are all honestly brilliant with their performances throughout this movie and the same goes with their dialogue. all of the characters dialogue which is given throughout this movie is all honestly great and non of their dialogue feels weak at all.  the cinematography which was shot by andrew lesnie, who did the first one's cinematography does another brilliant job at capturing the scenes so smooth and so beautifully. he does it so well and he makes the scenes look so amazing.  also, there's a lot more of the action sequences throughout this movie and they are very clever, very graphic and very unique just like the first ones were and they are all very well choreographed.  the movie's even got such a beautiful soundtrack, the score which was beautifully composed by howard leslie shore oc. he does such a great job with the soundtrack and it goes so well with the scenes they've been placed within this movie.  the movie's even got some brilliant humour, which always hits and it never misses. that's mainly from gimli (john rhys-davies) his character adds some really funny humour throughout this movie, which adds to his character quite a bit.  the movie's even got more dark themes (in my opinion), they add a lot more to the different locations which we end up discovering throughout this movie and it's done so well, which i really liked.  finally, the love interest in this movie is very well built up and it doesn't feel rushed at all, it's a very interesting one and i think it works quite a bit.  the pacing which this movie's got is all honestly brilliant and all of the moments are all built up very well and non of those scenes fail in any sort of way because they are all built up brilliantly.  the orcs throughout this movie have got more of a darker and more of a graphic look to them, which i think added a bit more of a disturbing look to them, which i really liked.  overall, lord of the rings: the two towers is honestly a brilliant sequel. the movie's got a brilliant story, brilliant performances, great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, clever action sequences, brilliant pacing, a beautiful soundtrack, brilliant humour, dark themes, more disturbing looking orcs and an interesting love interest.  i'd honestly recommend this movie, if you enjoyed the first one and if you're into fantasy/action movie's. i think this movie is honestly worth the watch and you'll probably enjoy it as much as the first one.",positive
No Name,5.0,"a brilliant middle chapter of an incredible trilogy, combined with jackson's direction, the script he co-wrote with walsh, boyens and sinclair, the performances of the cast, shore's score, lesnie's cinematography, horton's editing, major's production design, hennah and lee's set decoration, dickson and taylor's costume design, action sequences, sound design and visual effects, the two towers interlopes through three storylines incredibly effective and makes a beautiful and entertaining film!!!",positive
No Name,5.0,an amazing movie one of the best of all time.,positive
No Name,4.5,"this is a wonderful film. the entire helm's deep sequence is incredibly impressive visually, on the level of mad max: fury road. the special effects are really well done for a 2002 movie, and the score is absolutely flawless. my favorite part of this film is the anticipation that builds for the battle at helm's deep; it really feels like the whole story is leading to that scene. my only complaints are that things feel a little rushed (and as a disclaimer, i watched the theatrical version, not the extended edition). character motivations are often lacking, so a lot choices don't always make sense and character's seem to do this just for the sake of advancing the plot. similarly, the character development all felt a bit rushed, especially compared to the wonderfully rich development found in the novel version. but overall, these are minor criticisms. this movie is still incredible.",positive

No Name,5.0,i absolutely loved this film and i love lord of the rings so much. i love that they put gollum on the front row and some of my all-time favorite scenes are the scenes with gollum. i love that this takes place right after fellowship it really feels more like a journey. i can't get enough of the amazing score its just so good. some say this is the most perfect trilogy and i see why it is literally perfect. i love the makeup and prosthetics it is so good and the orcs look disgusting because of that and i love every single second of it i'm glad they didn't use motion capture suits for the orcs as the hobbit did. these films are an achievement in storytelling in keeping a whole journey and feeling like your really there and connected with them over three years. i can't get enough of the absolutely amazing worldbuilding it is literally amazing and nothing else can top it at all. peter jackson really did something amazing with this film that i don't think can be done again and if anyone else would have made this it would be so different and it would probably be worse. i'm so excited to see andy serkis as alfred in the batman he is such a good actor and needs an oscar nomination by now. i'm glad that they only do one thing that really is cgi throughout the entire movie and that is gollum which i love and i love the practical effects and not the cgi and green screen. this film has so many iconic things like the lines and everything about it is iconic from the characters to the score its all amazing. they try to humanize which gollum which i didn't think they would have but i love that they showed him in human form and andy serkis did an amazing job outside the motion capture suit which gets me more excited for the batman. this film has some of my all-time favorite lines as does the whole trilogy. smeagol is one of my all-time favorite film characters and he is so iconic. there are so many amazing grand-scale shots that show off the grand-scale of new zealand and they all look beautiful mixed with the film they shot on makes it look amazing and adding the score to that makes it some of the best shots of all time. i love the buildup for the battle of helms deep and it is one of my all-time favorite battles. this film again has one of the biggest cliffhangers of all time and i wish one of the companies would come out with the 9 hour and 30-minute version of it i would watch that so much.  like the last one they don't use sfx only but one time and that is for gollum which the sfx really holds up for all of the sfx now with endgame and lion king. i really cannot get enough of the amazing score i could listen to it for hours and not get bored it that's how much i love it. like before the sound mixing and editing are on point with the battle at the end sounding amazing and the elephant looking things too. i love the locations they used it this getting more into mordor and the color grading making it look like more of mordor it looks fabulous. the cinematography looks amazing. the script like the last film is amazing and it baffles me that one trilogy can earn 30 nominations/wins it just is outstanding that a film trilogy can do that and if you don't think this trilogy is perfect look at the oscar love that this got. like the previous film they develop their characters out so well i just love it and when characters have those heart to heart moments i just love those scenes and those are some of my favorites. the acting is on point and everyone is giving it their all especially elijah wood if just like the previous film if there was anything snubbed it was elijah wood's acting he actually is a really good actor and i wish he got more major roles after lord of the rings but he didn't he could have been a major hollywood star. the editing mixed with the suspenseful score creates these tense full scenes that i just love. the action scenes really hold up after all these years. overall i absolutely loved this film and would recommend it to anyone. üíØ%,positive
No Name,5.0,"pure art!incredibly epic and remarkably amazing movie!the journey of fellowship's the 3,4 different situation's story-lines with the goosebumps and epic end it was the great experience!the return of gandalf was satisfying as hell,the rohan's war build-up and the ring's quest with gollum and the tree's thing with two hobbits it was awesome,the army of sauron and saruman and there fights with two kingdoms and the story connecting major things it was brilliant,the ending war is literally a piece of art the losing hope of men's and the incredible turn with the satisfying scenery and music and the actions scenes with awesome cgi it was literally the greatest experience,the whole movie is a treat its a greatest sequel,a pure art,a masterpiece!",positive

No Name,4.0,"my son thinks in the lord of the rings trilogy that this is his favorite. mine is the return of the king. it's a great middle to a long journey by gandalf, frodo, sam, and aragon. it has many instances we're old alliances come to bear, old alliances jump in at last second to help the situation, no spoiler alerts here. whether you're a fan of the first, second or third installment it's a long exciting adventure. this successfully next the fellowship to return of the king nicely",positive
No Name,4.5,one of the best movies i've seen! this movie really depicted lord of the rings story very well. this movie was amazing and i really enjoyed watching it! there's a lot of battle violence/action but that's the most excitment in the movie. the helms deep battle was epic and awesome to watch! this may be one of the best fantasy movies i've seen! i give this 92% rotten tomatoes!,negative
No Name,4.5,"as with the fellowship of the ring, this is truly a beautiful and faithful adaptation of the book by tolkien. the cast is absolutely perfect and the shots are stellar. the battle of helm's deep is captivating and you will find yourself holding your breath as you vicariously feel the dismay of the people being besieged. another masterpiece by jackson.",positive
No Name,5.0,the two towers follows up fellowship of the ring and somehow manages to excel it. all the characters are well-rounded and extremely likeable and the plot keeps the audience intrigued all the time. it also introduces many new characters but never feels like anybody is being sidelined. golem is extremely interesting and there is a lot of really nice tension with the threat of sauron . the massive battle at the end of the film is expertly shot and keeps you on the edge of your seat - this film is a must see!,positive

No Name,5.0,best out of all of them!,positive
No Name,5.0,"fate would have it that the two towers is the quintessential post 911 allegory; faceless world altering evil being stood up to my the united grieving good of the little person. when gandalf or sam or merry or faramir speaks they're speaking using tolkien's words through time and talking directly to us. undoubtedly the success of this and the other rings movies are that they are lovingly and reverently adapted by teams of indie creatives at the height of their passion and the tops of their game. however, it's enduring legacy and legendary status owes itself to the fact that the two towers had, and still has, a reason to exist in the world. it speaks to what fantasy was made for and it bolsters the human spirit and champions hope and understanding, forgiveness and love.   there's a sensitivity here not usually applied to middle films in a trilogy but making the groundbreaking meld of cgi and characterisation of sm√©agol/gollum the central arc of the story is very smart. it gives the film thrust and purposeful connective tissue to return of the king. his arc from gollum to sm√©agol and to gollum again is sad, important and due to andy serkis also hilarious. it does everything a middle film should, introduces new characters, fleshes out old and builds tension to the third film. the battles are bigger but no less well crafted and every side story is a worthwhile one.   the extended version is a difficult bag, all the scenes removed are extraneous certainly, but are all brilliant moments and in any other film, indispensable. boromir and faramir scenes manage to actually give more relatability to a character that's already dead and the funeral of th√©oden's son is incredibly sad, poignant and pertinent.",positive

No Name,4.0,"filme foda, o roteiro √© legal, o vil√£o √© bacana, mas o que torna o filme melhor s√£o as cenas de a√ß√£o que s√£o muito excelentes, que passam em um deserto de areia gostei do tom hardy como mad max, gostei da participa√ß√£o da cherlize theron como furiosa, gostei de uma cena em que o maluco estava segurandobuma guitarra enquanto saia fogo pelos canos pelo caminh√£o, as cenas de dialogo algumas foram boas e outras n√£o, mas com tudo isso, eu recomendo muito esse filme, esse foi o melhor da franquia mad max.",positive

No Name,5.0,"as good as any movie i have ever seen, amazing.",positive
No Name,3.0,"not special story in whole, similar endings have been seen many (in different locations depending the script). beginning is interesting and endures as such quite well but not till end. on my opinion.",negative
No Name,5.0,"i loved it. george miller turned the desert into an absolute battleground with high-stakes action sequences and some genuinely likable characters: furiosa is a powerful warrior who wants to redeem herself for serving immortan joe, the movie's amazing villain; nux is insecure about his impending death and wants to go out in a literal blaze of glory; and the titular max is as cool as ever, learns to open up to others, and the speech he gives when all seems lost was just perfect.  it hurts to know this masterpiece was a nightmare to make and how badly it financially underperformed. i honestly think the movie warranted a pg-13 rating; the goriest part was probably the villain's death, it was totally bearable for a modern teenage audience. but hey, the fact that a sequel was even greenlit sparks a little hope. mad max lived, it died, and lived again. fury road will ride eternal, shiny and chrome.",positive
No Name,5.0,my favourite movie of the past decade.  larger than life and twice as fun.,positive

No Name,5.0,the post apocalyptic film of our age. nuf zed.,negative
No Name,4.5,"the perfect adventure film.  thrilling and original - that's how you can describe this film in two words. george miller's style may not be everyone's cup of tea,and some may not understand it, but this is true cinema. with minimal dialogue and a huge amount of action, the film still manages to remain genuinely deep.",positive
No Name,4.0,this is a great film that i had to rewatch after seeing furiosa because the first time i watch it i was lost about what this was about; furiosa was such a great introduction of the franchise to new viewers that this is perfect sequel to it. i loved it more and appreciated after furiosa so stellar job perfect action film to enjoy; hopefully they make a third one to end this saga of soft reboot.,positive
No Name,5.0,"i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever seen this much intense action in one movie. just wow. i wish gibson could have played the title guy, but hardy does it great. and miller somehow creates this insane future world that is believable, scary, and fascinating. sci-fi does not get any better.",positive
No Name,0.5,i really don't understand how this movie is rated so high. i was hoping that it wouldn't be any worse than thunderdome. it's like mad max meets the rocky horror pic show. i've never not finished watching a movie and am highly disappointed that i sat thru the entirety of fury road. never will watch it a second time.,negative
No Name,4.0,"did not expect to love it, got persuaded by a friend to see it.   some of it i found kinda gruesome and hard to watch but overall i really enjoyed it and i love furiosa.",positive

No Name,5.0,"a perfect action film. great cast, practical effects, not too long, intense and memorable scenes, and just enough story to glue it together. don't bother with furiosa, it's a cheap imitation of this film.",positive
No Name,4.5,fury road perfectly captures the harsh and epic nature of the franchise while also introducing the most gorgeous portrayal of australia to date.,positive
No Name,5.0,"an action masterpiece. easy must watch if you enjoy the mad max universe/saga and some good ol' action. sure, not having mel gibson as max is sad, but tom hardy really delivers. talking about delivering, charlize as furiosa is *chef's kiss*. solid story, great acting and awesome action scenes!  10/10 action movie. watched many times.",positive

No Name,4.0,"good, but only a spinoff.",positive
No Name,5.0,"wow. this movie is amazing. its very different to what you expect from the mad max franchise. but then compare mad max 1 with 2. tom hardy does a great job, even with very little to say. charlize theron really does lead this movie. this movie does a great job at setting up a new universe. fast paced non stop entertainment. love it",positive
No Name,5.0,"the finest movie you ever made, one that i‚Äôve been waiting for for three decades or more.  the grand master didn‚Äôt let us down with this forever creation.  tom hardy was divine, one couldn‚Äôt ask for more from him.",positive
No Name,5.0,the order of the novel is surprising,negative

No Name,1.5,"while i have a lot of admiration for tom hardy, even his talent can't save this one for me.  the movie feels like a relentless series of glorified action scenes that fail to establish any emotional connection.  the plot is almost non-existent, essentially boiling down to a prolonged chase for two-thirds of the film, only to reverse course and head back for the final act.  despite the visually stunning spectacle and high-octane energy, the lack of a deeper narrative or character development leaves the experience feeling hollow and unsatisfying. the film's emphasis on action over substance ultimately detracts from its potential to be a truly memorable entry in the franchise.",negative
No Name,5.0,this is still one of the best action movies i've ever seen! 2 hours of exhilarating action and practical stunts with phenomenal performances from everyone.   you must witness it!,positive

No Name,5.0,"honestly one of the only movies i think that completely outshines the originals. as awesome as they were at the time, they missed the absolute mayhem and carnage we are shown in the masterclass of effects. obviously the time they were made plays a huge part, but this movie i believe just has better overall writing and characters. it is a must watch and each time i watch it i‚Äôm thoroughly in awe in what the team was able to accomplish in making this masterpiece",positive

No Name,5.0,they should make a mad max movie without mad max.  i would totally pretend to care about it.,negative
No Name,4.5,"really enjoyed this movie! one of the best action movies for sure. i understand that some may find this weird, but if you really look at it then you'll also find its brilliance in the world building and plot. it's pretty incredible that this movie actually has a well formed plot considering it's pure non-stop action throughout the entirety of the movie. acting: 10/10. story: 10/10. character development: 8.5/10. action: 10/10. in my opinion this is a solid 9/10.",positive
No Name,3.5,"recently watched this again. great story-telling, character development is pretty great.   however, this harkened the departure from the character of max. until the second act he is really just a footnote, literally called ""blood bag"". his entrance as a main character is impressive, which to the quality writing and editing.",positive

No Name,5.0,"this is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. it wastes no time getting to what makes movies great. epic action,unique and creative world building, and it does a great job reflecting mankind in its most basic nature of savagery and survival. this film makes a mythology of characters who are all doomed regardless of their efforts, yet gives the audience a sense of hope against all odds through the most impossible of circumstances. this movie has a great music score and memorable imagery including the wonderful use of practical effects and the ingenuity of the iconic custom vehicles made for it. truly one of a kind.",positive

No Name,5.0,"a modern action masterpiece that strikes all the right chords and rocks all the right riffs. a few unnecessary gross-out moments aside, this is arguably as good as any 2000‚Äôs action movie has been, holding the title without a challenger in sight. witness it!",positive

No Name,0.5,"what the hell was everyone else watching that this movie was so popular? the visuals and audio were great, but the characters and plot were unbelievably bad. no, i really mean that. watch the movie again and try to imagine any actual human being being so unbelievably idiotic as the characters in this movie. ""hey, we just escaped the bad guys by the narrowest of narrow margins. what should we do with our newfound freedom? i know, let's go back so we can do another 20 minute action montage!""  for the love of all that is holy, this was a massive insult to the first two actual mad max films. it firmly belongs in a category with thunderdome.",negative

No Name,5.0,"mad max fury road is one hell of a ride. from beginning to end this film is heart pounding. the action/choreography is fantastic and leaves you with one very big adrenaline rush all due to its fast pace. the pacing was very fast which worked well for this kind of story. then there are the performances which are great. charlize theron, tom hardy, and nicholas hoult where all great in this film with each one of seemingly becoming their characters rather than acting as them. in terms of direction george miller shows off his abilities. miller is amazing at making this steam punk dystopian world come to life. the fact that most of the visuals are made via practical effects is crazy. to add onto this, the cinematography and colors are great as well. mad max fury road is very fine filmmaking.  with all that being said i do find flaws in this film. the characters are pretty bland. the film is mostly fast paced however it does slow down at certain points to focus on it's characters. characters like furiosa, max, and nux were explored but, they weren't explored enough to make them particularly strong characters. they had the potential and when they were being explored it was great; however, they weren't fully explored/developed which is definitely the film's biggest flaw. the visual effects also looked a bit wacky and poor at times but that is more of a nitpick than an actual flaw.   mad max fury road is from a visual and practical sense phenomenal with great themes and performances; however, it's characters aren't particularly it's strong point. regardless, this is a fantastic film that i'll highly recommend.",positive

No Name,4.0,"great reboot and a great film for action fans. while i initially didn't care for tom hardy's performance, it kind of grew on me after a second watch. he has very little dialogue but really does seem mad and haunted by his past. i hope the upcoming furiosa movie is similar to this.",positive

No Name,4.5,"i was indifferent to the original mad max movie, and i remember being disappointed by it on several attempts to watch it, so i wasn't expecting much from this sequel. was i wrong though! this movie is almost non stop action, and the story is both exciting and easy to follow. the special effects are first rate, and i soon became absorbed into the film's world. to be honest, the character's don't have a lot to say, and you mostly pick up the plot from riding with them on their journey. that's not a bad thing in this case, because the film's pace is such that there is no time for the verbose narrative often found in other movies. i highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes action movies because it is one of the best i have seen.",positive
No Name,3.0,this is a test review,negative
No Name,5.0,"all time classic. pretty much everything about this is flawless. the only minor complaints is there isn't much character development with max and dare i say it feels like he's not even the main character at certain points. furiosa is incredible and the best thing in this. she outshines max. also, the fact they go back the way they came makes it feel a little bit like the escape of the first half was pointless to an extent but who cares. this is 2 hours of a straight adrenline rush and the most action packed of the franchise. i will say this is a hair beneath mad max 2 for me because while hardy is really good as max, gibson is better. also, max had more development and focus and while the chases in this are amazing and incredible, the end of the second still i feel is slightly better. however, where the second can be a bit slow in the first half this floors it and never lets up the entire way. it's really just personal taste at that point comparing this and 2. watch it and decide for yourself!",positive

No Name,5.0,"spoilers this apocalyptic fiction follows max, a man coping with the death of his wife and child, who is captured by a group of survivors (more like lunatics), loyal to the tyrannical immortan joe. when furiosa takes joe's five wives in the war rig to bring them east to their liberty, max is dragged along in an insane adventure full of monster trucks, explosions, fire, death, bullets, gas, gas and more gas.   this is peak fiction. the apocalyptic desert that is depicted, the design of the war machines and costumes, the character arcs, fire, explosions, scale... its an action-fuelled masterpiece. the world miller has crafted is so erratic, chaotic and octane filled - its insane and beautiful. a wasteland where humans treat gas like a god, completely obsessed with badass-looking vehicles and meeting their death on the road. i wanted more when the credits rolled, more time to explore this eccentric world and its characters. for lack of a better term the shit in this movie is strait up cool. like look at the concept art for vehicles, the costumes and the landscape - and tell me its not fucking cool! the production design reminds me of blade runner, not because it is at all similar, but because it is visually striking, unique, imaginative and captivating. they have created a world here which is not ours, a fictional world with nuances and touches that make it wonderful to get lost in.   it was essentially non-stop action for two hours, and it never got old or boring, just high stakes over and over and over. the war rig was practically a character in itself and the battles moving at high speed will be forever etched in my mind. two hours of strait action and i could have done with two more. there was some very credible and satisfying character arcs here as well amidst the explosions. nux is absolutely the most notable. at the start of the film i hated this man and his people for their octane filled delusions of valhalla and blatant insanity, but by the end i saw nux as a man who put his life on the line for who he now considers friends. he escaped from the lies and oppression joe was feeding his people. it was a powerful character transition and death. max's relationship with furiosa and the wives is a pleasure to see unravel and become somewhat friendly at the end too.   one thing i really like about this film too is how it doesn't give you any exposition or explanation for the wasteland, factions, people, and how they came to be. at first i was confused (i haven't seen the originals), but i came to realize that them not opening the film up with some expedited narration, or exposition from the characters - makes it so much more intriguing and enthralling. the creators don't owe first time watchers an explanation as there's tons of previous movies and lore, and i like how we are not ‚Äòbabied' into this world, but simply taken along for the ride.   overall, mad max combines masterfully imaginative production design, world building, characters and gas to create one of the best action films i've ever seen.",positive

No Name,5.0,a masterpiece from start to finish. a simple plot that tells a thousand stories. stuntwork unparalleled. if you like action even a little bit you have to see this movie. this movie has zero flaws.,positive
No Name,4.0,"how the original mad max might have looked with a big budget and modern technology. action scenes are great, sound design and visuals are a+. however, the soundtrack is very unmemorable, and i don't know if hardy works as max, at least if you prefer the original version of the character.",negative
No Name,5.0,"honestly, when i saw the movie's cover i was skeptical and when i fired it up on hbo, it grabbed me from the very beginning.   there was not a single moment of the movie where i was bored. i would totally recommend it.",positive
MD,2.5,"sorry all ! watch the original mad max movies with mel gibson instead,,,they are much better than this. charlize is good, hardy is nonexistent‚Ä¶and one long chase is a bit overkill. road warrior is sooooooo much better!",negative
No Name,3.5,"film d'azione da manuale. probabilmente uno dei film d'azione meglio riusciti. messa in scena unica, con costumi incredibili, sceneggiatura perfettamente allineata al contesto scenografico, gran cast, con un tom hardy a livelli molto alti. un george miller in grande spolvero.",positive
No Name,4.0,entertaining movie. plot was mediocre but the action and characters got us through to the end. the cast did a great job in their roles and delivered some good characters,positive
No Name,3.5,"tom hardy, no doubt, has a powerful presence, but it seems that cherlize theron dominated the movie, which puzzles me as to why the title ""mad max: fury road."" it should have been called ""mad furiosa: fury road."" hopefully, tom hardy will do another sequel and it will be more about his character! otherwise, don't entitle the movie mad max! he's amazing to watch and very entertaining but it seems to me he took a backseat in this one. nothing against theron but now i can understand why there may have been some conflict between the two of them. theron is an amazing performer but i was hoping to see more of hardy. just my opinion! kudos should go out to the rest of the cast, though. they were all wonderful and i can understand theron being frustrated making this movie because all i saw was desert and more desert. i would have gone berserk! however, i would hope that mel gibson would be proud of hardy for what he was able to contribute to this movie!",negative
No Name,0.5,"this movie was not as advertised!  no real character development, bad special effects, and a huge bait and switch.  people wanted a mad max movie not a charlie theron action movie!  i can't believe this shit has such a high score on this site!!!",negative
No Name,3.5,"premise and execution more ridiculous than waterworld, but a very entertaining action movie if you don't think too hard about the australian coast being only max 66.7 hours away at 30 kmph. 6.8/10 - not quite good but more than adequate.",positive
No Name,4.5,"yeah, this is better than cats.",positive
No Name,3.0,"the acting was solid. strong performances from everyone. however, it was sad to see the title character take a backseat in his own movie. the movie should have been called furiosa.",negative
No Name,3.5,"gorgeous visuals paired with non-stop action that was well choreographed, it's guaranteed to be a good time but nothing past that. the acting is very mid, as whilst it's not bad there's nothing specially unique or memorable about it, with even tom hardy admitting to not trying very hard during press conferences. the action is of course the highlight, and it's full of unique and memorable moments, just nothing that can redeem the pretty basic story of a point to point end goal, as everything that aren't fights or battles feel like exposition for the fights, leading to the ending and any attempt at emotion feeling lost as it comes off as too forced and i just can't care much about the characters other than max and furiosa.",negative
No Name,4.5,"as an audio/video set piece, it succeeds with great splendor.  i applaud the method of storytelling, using visuals and minor character dialog to explain things instead of railroading the viewer into forced storytelling where every single thing has to be spelled out.  they leave things up to interpretation, as more movies should.  let people internalize things differently, sometimes that can be more interesting and feels more personal.  i feel strongly compelled to re-buy this movie in 4k, the visuals were already fantastic in 1080p but i can only imagine in hdr.  also this movie has some incredible atmos implementation, don't skip this if you're a home theater enthusiast!",positive

No Name,5.0,"this is almost a perfect movie.  it is over the top and accepts it, yet still somehow stays serious.  mad max knows what it is and doesn't try to be something different.  visually amazing, and a nice nod to the 80's movies while being its own thing.  loved it.",positive
No Name,5.0,"this movie has non-stop action but its stimulating, energetic and never feels exhausting or monotonous. the score is absolutely breathtaking in tone. watch this one on a big screen with decent audio if you can.",positive
No Name,3.0,"it's really well made and any individual 20 minutes of it are great, but it's also kind of one long action scene and by the end it's really hard to be at all invested.  i probably should have broken this one into chunks and watched it over a few days, i think that's what i'd recommend.",negative

No Name,5.0,this movie is just gold. action. world building. visuals. acting. sound track. just an amazing must watch film.,positive
No Name,3.0,"mad max delivers as an action movie. but those calling it an ""instant classic"" need to calm down. mad max is a visually imaginative, pulse-pounding spectacle, but it certainly has none of the subtle, all time great acting performances that made films like the godfather true film classics that appeal to nearly everyone. mad max is unique enough to set itself apart from the usual action flick, but the story isn't that great.",positive
No Name,4.0,"the action alone is what makes this movie, which is directed very pristinely for the most part. it really slowed down in the middle but other than that it was entertaining. while i couldn't get behind other characters as much and wasn't entirely on board with the universe and the craziness surrounding it, i didn't feel like i needed to! i still liked tom hardy's character quite a bit though. it's one of the better action movies i've seen for sure!",positive

No Name,4.0,probably the greatest action film of all time the film has great action a good story but its problem is development in its characters and its lack of back story,positive
No Name,4.5,"oh boy is this an acquired taste. didn‚Äôt much care for it after one viewing but after a rewatch, it became quite apparent that this is an amazing film. 95/100",positive
No Name,2.0,"if you like non-stop action in the form of never ending chases, fiery explosions, savage killings and general mayhem, mad max: fury road is probably right up your alley.  if you like movies with meticulously developed characters, a compelling story and intelligent dialogue, you should probably take a pass on george miller's most recent installment in the franchise.  the stunts and special effects are remarkable and much of the cinematography is excellent, but the continual parade of bodies flying through the air, vehicles exploding in balls of flame and characters mumbling incoherently grows repetitive after a short time, making it an exhausting experience at best.  despite the widespread praise that's been heaped on fury road, it's clearly not for all tastes.",negative

No Name,5.0,greatest. action. movie. ever. made.,positive
No Name,5.0,"the opening monologue given to us by tom hardy is probably one of my top 5 moments in film history. it's so well written and beautifully delivered and it goes so well with what's actually happening on the screen. what a great start to an even greater film!  i think one of the most unique and intriguing things about mad max: fury road as a whole is the way it's filmed. it's beautifully shot but it's very different from other movies. there's times where it'll speed up, and while the dialogue is at normal speed, the scene in the background is at 1.5x speed. super unique and i love it!  this cinematography! good heavens i'm in love with the colors and the angles and the shaky effect‚Ä¶ gosh it is so visually pleasing. when i first watched this i didn't quite have my ""directors eye"" (as some might call it) but upon rewatch i'm absolutely in love with the camerawork in every scene. i can't get over this cinematography. the colors are just so stunning, especially when it switches from orange to blue. so so great.  the jumps and transitions between scenes is perfection. the pacing overall is actually amazing and i'd say that this is the most intricately timed film i've seen which makes watching super enjoyable.  i'm also in love with this score. it's at times rock music which gets you hyped but at other times it's an orchestra playing a somber song‚Ä¶ perfectly split between exciting and devastating. the music itself is extremely emotional and will bring you into what the characters are feeling whether it be excitement or trauma. let me reiterate this, the score is phenomenal. there's simply no other word to describe it.  an underrated(?) part of this film are the vfx! every time a car would blow up or blood would spill i was blown away by how real it looked. you can tell a lot of time was spent focusing on the visual aspects but especially the visual effects!  no one could direct this the way george miller did. mad max: fury road could only be written, produced, and directed by a mad man, and george miller proved his worth. arguably better than its predecessors, fury road is revolutionary. it's a film that could bring you into the realm of film, as it is perfect in near every aspect. it will make you love cinematography, will show you what a films score can really be, provides a wonderful example of the different forms of acting, and so much more. i somehow forgot how good this film really is. absolutely amazing, 10/10!",positive
No Name,4.0,"lo que hace impecable a esta versi√≥n de ""mad max"" esta en como george miller, desde el primer minuto da exposici√≥n a la historia que quiere contar. sin enredar o alargar innecesariamente la trama. donde desde los primeros 10 minutos dan foco a todo lo que va a ser fundamental en la trama, ya sean personajes locaciones y hasta cosas que parecen tan banales que en como avanza la historia se vuelven fundamentales, usando de una incre√≠ble manera el ""es mejor mostrar que decir"", y en eso se basa la mayor parte la pel√≠cula, buscando que en los planos mismos se desaten los sentimientos y el porque de las cosas, ya que en ellos recae todo el peso de la historia. donde todos hacen un trabajo extraordinario entendiendo a los mismos. ya sean los actores, los encargados de vestuario, los extras y los directores de c√°mara. uni√©ndose de gran manera para crear una experiencia √∫nica. el mundo de mad max es interesante en todo aspecto. esta pel√≠cula se a vuelto una de esas pel√≠culas que cada vez se vuelven mas escasas, una pel√≠cula que busca la genialidad en el entorno, en donde se desarrollan los acontecimientos de la trama y de ah√≠ partir para profundizar todo lo dem√°s. una pel√≠cula que enamora con la vista.",positive

No Name,3.5,"this movie was clearly a vehicle to introduce charlize theron as the next lead in the franchise. otherwise, why does her role exponentially supersede that of tom hardy as the titular character.  is this a great action movie? yes. is it thrilling with great action sequences and effects? most definitely.  pitfalls are the less than stellar dialogue and the forgettable supporting characters.   but i guess we don't watch action flicks for their stellar dialogue or storytelling.  oh well! it was at least entertaining.",positive

No Name,4.0,"like a lot of people i didn't really know what to expect with this reboot. but also as with a lot of people i was pleasantly surprised.   the visuals in this movie are very well done and more than compliment the setting of a post-apocalyptical wasteland. obviously taking the visual style of mad max 2 and giving it an enhancement with some borderlands vibes thrown in which i'm a big fan of.  my only true peeve is that max's character is rather flat. but this is forgiven by the fact we get some great character development with furiosa and nux.  also the high octane fight scene that consumes majority of the film, despite being very well shot, does tend to make one start to feel like zoning out. but to be honest i think that's just a me thing.",positive
No Name,1.0,one of the worst movies i've ever seen.  it has nothing to do with mad max and has zero story line.  i think the screenwriters dropped acid before they wrote this pathetic script.,negative
No Name,4.0,"a fun and surprisingly exciting narrative that has only a few minor flaws, particularly with its scope and sometimes less-explained side characters. fury road made a real impact, probably much greater than the original mad max, but even for its impact, there are definite points near the end where you'll start to ask to get off the ride.",positive
No Name,5.0,"mad max: fury road is basically a 2-hour long action scene. this movie barely ever stops, the plot is always advancing forward. all the action scenes are insane, unique and exciting. the story itself is also interesting and i found myself rooting for the protagonists. and i really liked how all the characters very useful and were helping each other. the ""damsel in distress"" trope has been subversed excellently.",positive

No Name,3.5,straight up action movie if there ever was one. for a bit of the movie i was distracted by how this connects to the other movies but then i just didn't care. didn't really pay attention to the plot except to understand what was going on. stunts and visuals were the best i've seen in awhile especially if most were actually practical and not cg. very entertaining. i would rent it for $3 once/yr to watch it.,positive
No Name,0.5,"i have never been this disappointed in a film for which i had expected so little. this film ham-handedly delivers half-baked social and political commentary where the main character speaks all of about five words and the action seems like it was composed by a puberty-crazed twelve year old boy on cocaine, copious amounts of cocaine. i found myself somewhere between indignant anger and hysterical laughter as i watched this train wreck of a movie that people were lauding as an artistic masterpiece. i am afraid that watching this film may have more adverse effects on cognitive development than a year drinking flint, michigan tap water.",negative

No Name,3.5,"the road warrior is one of the most iconic films of the 20th century.  making a subsequent film, without mel gibson, 40+ years later was a gamble for george miller. it is not the road warrior but it is good.  tom hardy is good as max, but, oddly a second player to charlize theron's lead character. she is bold and good as the female leader rescuing the wives of the central cult like villain.  she is clearly the 21st century, female embodiment of the original max-this is evidenced by her early mimic of the road warrior dialogue.  much of this post apocalyptic wasteland is familiar and brutal.   the madness, violence, scarcity, and perversity are all out of miller's universe. the cinematography is spotty at times, and too frenetic for my taste.  the vehicular chases and related effects are stunning.  the theme of female empowerment is great.  worth the roller coaster ride.",positive

No Name,4.5,"the stunts, choreography, effects, set design, and costume design more than make up for the minimal story here. charlize theron is excellent and tom hardy is fine (not that he had a lot to work with). it takes its simple premise and executes it nearly flawlessly and i love all of the female empowerment throughout. like, yeah, i'm completely sold that a dozen badass women are gonna come destroy capitalism and save the world. i'm all for it; let's go already. this movie is like watching olympic gymnasts try to murder each other, which is basically exactly what it is. it's extremely action-heavy, but all of the choreography is so unique and well-done that it's incredibly engaging. the battles between characters are ridiculous and impractical, but the movie makes the world feel alien enough that it doesn't stand out as distracting, just as freaking awesome. the violence is brutal but oh-so-satisfying. the set pieces are all really impressive and each location feels different, despite having a fairly consistent desert backdrop. it has a few cliches, like how the main characters refuse to die despite having concussions and broken bones that could have killed them dozens of times over. injuries also seem to heal themselves in a matter of minutes, allowing our heroes to continue the fight when they should be immobilized at best. this takes away some of the gritty realism (which sounds ridiculous for this movie, i know) and ultimately hampers a bit of the experience. also, as much as i appreciate the practical effects and lack of cgi, the occasional moments of cgi feel very out of place. that being said, i still love this movie and the visuals will never fail to amaze me. i've never even seen any of the original mad max films, but i just might have to go back and check them out.",positive

No Name,3.0,"62/100. first things first, this movie is very metal and very steampunk so if you're not into that, you're not going to like this movie. the main thing i didn't like about ‚Äòfury road' is that there are parts that are weird and uncomfortable just for the sake of being weird and uncomfortable. the people in this movie are so detached from humanity yet the movie never explained how humans wavered so far in the first place. also, this movie is predictable especially the third act. this film has an interesting premise and does a good job world building but most of the movie is just car chase after car chase after car chase. when the actors and actresses are able to do their thing, that is when this movie is at its best even though we don't get much of it. as an action movie, it does what action movies are supposed to do in terms of action sequences, but it was not my cup of tea and i'm sure i'm not the only one who thinks this way.",negative
No Name,2.0,horrible movie by itself.  worse movie when you compared to the original mel gibson trilogy.  the movie is simply a big-budget amalgam of the originals. breeders = gasoline from the road warrior & master from thunderdome immortan joe = aunty entity + the humungus nux = the feral kid + jedediah motorcycle gang = toe-cutter + goose  the only surprise is that imperator furiosa so did not die like jessie & warrior woman. the storyline is canned.  the plot is ridiculous.  the non-sequiturs are innumerous.  too bad charlize theron and tom hardy signed up for this version of kingdom of the crystal skull.,negative

No Name,5.0,i don't usually like gory action movies but the stunning visuals and emotional depth of mad max: fury road have earned it a permanent spot on my list of favorite movies,positive
No Name,5.0,best action movie of all time,positive
No Name,4.5,"witness me...  it's been awhile since i watched this movie, and since it's on hbo max, i wanted to relive it.  and i loved this movie. one of the most fun, entertaining, and spectacular action movies that i have ever watched. i was in awe at how they were able to film these long sequences of car chase in the desert.   the first half was unrelenting. two major action sequences made for an intense and fast-moving experience. the editing that focused on the face of the characters created the sense of intensity and craziness. the second half was pretty much the same thing and i was still amazed at the incredible work put into these sequences.   my only problem was that at the middle, the movie slowed down, which was fine initially. however, i felt it took a bit too long. i honestly didn't care much for the characters, and just wanted the action. therefore, the emotion wasn't too much there.   overall, one of the best and relentless action movies that entertaining me from the start to finish. it was quite a fury road indeed. 9/10",positive
No Name,0.5,absolutely terrible. what could you possibly like about this movie?,negative
No Name,3.5,"it's a good movie. hell, it's a great movie-  but it isn't mad max. mad max went mad because of his wife and son's slaughter in the australian outback- this one is just crazy. it's wearing a mask it does not need and simply took the name so it could get traction. demeaning, but ok.   it makes me a bit sad that this wasn't a pick-up of the trilogy, but simply a reboot. this max has no past to me, no reasoning. i could replace him with anyone and not feel different.   that being said, it's a great dystopian film. there are so many good parts and so many interesting implications. i do recommend it.",positive
No Name,2.0,"sure, fury road is boldly beautiful, adds a nice feminine angle to the storyline and includes all the post-apocalyptic trademarks that i expected as an og fan of the original trilogy. but i can't help thinking for a film that was supposed to take the action genre to even greater heights, it really never strayed far from the standard action fare. i'll take a simple story and interesting characters over stunning visuals every time.",positive
No Name,4.5,breathtaking scenery and action sequences. one of the most flawless action films created with cinematography that emerges its viewer into the films dystopian landscape.,positive

No Name,5.0,"rating: a+  director: george miller  mad max: fury road is one of those films were you literally can't look away, cause there just is to much in every frame that you could miss. tom hardy and charlize theron lead the ensemble cast and the two of them have an amazing chemistry. i gotta say that nicholas hoult delivered an breakthrough performance. the screenplay is great ( unlike in many other blockbusters ) and miller's direction is even better. there definitely has to be props to the stunt team too cause what they did is nothing but brilliant. the sound, costumes, production design and editing were really great too. but i think the 6 academy awards speak for themselves.",positive

No Name,4.0,"really pleasantly surprised at this movie. the supporting cast really saves this movie because other than max looking and pulling off some christopher lambart looks and body language, his character development was rather weak compared to the others. thats ok though because you are a mad max fan that knows this mans story inside out. otherwise, its the wheel for you.... you know the rule.  bust a deal. face the wheel.  witness meeeee!",positive

No Name,5.0,this is one of the best movies ever in history and futer made! mad max fury road is fck masterpiece!,positive
No Name,5.0,"max mad fury road is brilliant! the way it recreates and updates the post apocalyptic world from the original films is spectacular. and it's new story and characters make it stand out in ways the original(s) did not. the camera shots are thoughtful and unique. the colors are bright and genuine to life and along with the non-stop action, pull the viewer in making you feel like you're right there with the characters on screen. even if you're not a fan of action movies the sheer artistry of max max fury road will demand your full attention (and make your jaw drop). all reboots should be this great.  keep your fingers crossed for a sequel because you will want to see more (*and hopefully it will have the same actors because recasting the actors destroys a film's contiunity and it's character's integrity and appeal).",positive

No Name,2.0,"don't get mad but i thought this movie kinda sucked. yes, the action was pretty great and the reasons behind some of the character's decisions are actually really well thought out and believable. but besides that, the rest of the movie sucked. there was no drama, the acting was pretty bad (except nicholas hoult), the way the characters were sped up was both cringey and unsatisfying and the movie had like zero levity. like, can't someone spit out a joke for once? literally everyone is serious af and it's a f'n mad max movie! anyways, this movie felt bland in literally everything except the action. and it's cool if you like this movie just for the action, but it just isn't my cup of tea.",negative
No Name,5.0,"this film still hits well after all these years. whether your watching it in color on a date at a theatre or ""black & chrome"" at home , the cinematography , the pace, the cuts, the story, the explosions, the sex and zest - are all to die for. this is what hollywood movies are made of and for.  if you can get your hands on it, see the black & chrome silent cut - not available through streaming (i learned the hard way). i caught an abridged version on youtube instead, as i decided to retread down fury road, far away from my 1st viewing at the magic johnson theater, and still loved every second of my experience. - audiomack.com/cvrthebard",positive
No Name,3.5,"this is a solid action movie with some well done special effects and a few very beautiful landscape shots that really help create the dystopian world the movie is set in. the casting was great and what emotion there was, felt genuine. my biggest issue with this movie was there is no explanation of back story. i went into this movie having not seen any previous mad max movies and the movie plays out as if the audience is already well aware of max's backstory (including a sub plot with a hallucination of a girl which i still don't get). since the last movie in the series came out in 1985, i was hoping that backstory would be re-established (seriously, a 5-10 minute flash back at the beginning of the movie would've been awesome). instead you are dropped into the movie and it took 20 minutes before i was really hooked. i feel that one piece alone would've helped my movie experience incredibly. all that aside, it's was still a great movie and i look forward to the next installment. i will probably go back and watch the old ones as well. if you are planning on watching this movie it is very well worth it but i suggest you try to get the backstory first.",negative
No Name,3.0,"a theatre circus act of a movie, overly numerous and stretched poignancies, implausablability, chartoonish characters, neverending chase scenes, debauched nuances and unbelievable premises mean this is a film that is a spectacle of how spectacular you can make something, not a film with a story.",negative
No Name,4.5,"great ""antihero"" movie",negative
No Name,5.0,"this is a classic, it pays respect to the main character, the scenes are beautiful and flow well, the film keeps you watching and there's never a dull moment. this is how you do a female lead, she is strong but not flawless and does not win every fight. she is the opposite of a mary sue which is how it should be done.",positive

No Name,0.5,"love the original mad max but i don't understand why people like this. i know there is nuance story to it and i don't doubt that at all. but the action i cannot understand why people praise it so much. max does barley any fighting at all compared to the original 3 and the only action that is in it is people chucking explosive spears at cars. thats it! maybe 1 scene with max using his shotgun or furiosa using a pistol or something. basically the film is drive to point a, get spears chucked at them, reach point b, realise they got to go back to point a, drives back to point a, gets hit by more spears, reaches point a again, frees people. there ya go thats the film.   and i love the actors and actresses in this film but max isn't max anymore. he just grunts and nods and has zero character. fanboys will say he doesn't say much in the originals but if you watch them again you will see not only are you wrong but there is so much story to him in the originals that even his grunts or nods mean a lot more in those films then the words max finally gets to utter in this film. tom hardy could be a great successor to mel gibson but the writing of the character ruined it. no longer is he the angry but smart and kind of charismatic loner from the first film, now he is just a moody guy that just does things.",negative

No Name,3.0,"visually appealing with a good cast and acting, but excessive focus on action over plot.  they certainly accomplish the creation of a dystopian world that is interesting.  the vehicles, the citadel, and the mechanics of things are impressive.  to me, you just have this set of interesting characters that you don't know really anything about, so you don't fully appreciate their actions and motivations.  you don't get a chance to get emotionally involved because it's a stranger you just met.  i would have preferred the film to be split over 2-3 individual films in more of a peter jackson format of developing the characters over time but shot at once.",negative

No Name,5.0,"potent, technical, stunning, wild, these are some adjectives that describe this feature. mad max: fury road is a complete chaos orchestrated by human beings in their most ambiguous insanity in a post-apocalyptic world. george miller created an extremely fascinating, perverse, and brutal work, portraying a world where people are at their emotional, physical, and especially mental limits. the first feature, 1979's mad max, came with a somewhat daring proposal, where the focus would be on unbridled action in an australia where the streets were taken by people and their vehicles in a state of madness, and at the same time that max (played by mel gibson), a police officer respected by his comrades and the city where he works, sees himself with his ideals coming to the fore when he goes through an experience that will shake his life forever. with the original trilogy finished in mad max beyond thunderdome (mad max - beyond the thunder dome) in 1985, it was 28 years before the filming of the new feature started, which started in july 2012 in namibia, and was released in 2015. there was an expectation coming from a director like george miller, but as images and trailer were being released, it became a work with great potential, and this was realized with its release, only the maximum potential of everything was raised. what was expected. the experience of experiencing (or rather saying ""witnessing"") this feature in a movie theater, was certainly one of the best things of that year. mad max: fury road is one of the best films of 2015, and of the past decade, the biggest and best action film in the history of cinema.",positive
