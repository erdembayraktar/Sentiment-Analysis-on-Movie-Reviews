Name,Rating,Review
No Name,4,One of the best action films ever created.
No Name,5,One of the best action movies ever made. Pack with action and you will be  sad watching it. I DO NOT CARE WHO YOU ARE YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.
No Name,5,Amazing in theatre's. Underwhelming at home unless you've seen it on a big screen with surround sound first.
No Name,5,Lmkiytfgjgsxfhnjhddgf
No Name,1,Cowboys and Indians in the Great Australian Outback.. There is NO plot.. just one L-O-N-G chase with LOTS of dead and dying  that ultimately circled 'round itself...
No Name,5,You must take this ride!
No Name,5,"Great movie, but should've been a different supporting character - not Mad Max.."
No Name,0.5,"Utter garbage. Terrible story, terrible acting, ridiculous special effects."
No Name,5,Simply incredible. Two hours of suspension of disbelief and immersive dystopian entertainment. What more can you say: Mad Max to the max.
No Name,5,This movie literally made me tired sitting through it. In the best sort of way. I felt exhausted like I was along for the ride. It’s a great action movie and is pretty much go-go-go from the beginning with little time wasted on exhibition.
No Name,4,"Crazy, entertaining and fun, but overly voilent. Provided you don't take this movie too seriously - it's thoroughly enjoyable. Tip: If you haven't seen this - watch Furiosa first (even though it's a more recent release) - as this movie seamlessly flows on after Furiosa and it's well worth watching them back to back."
No Name,5,Esse é o melhor filme de ação de todos os tempos
No Name,3.5,"With astonishing moments and great, yet sometimes awkward visuals, it’s hard to decide what I thought of this movie and really, the entire franchise as a whole. The action was more than serviceable and lived up to its reputation, and the story was a step above the likes of Thunderdome for sure. As for the actors, they were all tremendous in their roles and the acting was far beyond the first three movies with Tom Hardy taking control of the lead role and Charlize Theron joining the fray. As a new addition to the franchise that is Mad Max, it is refreshing and nice to see, but as for the franchise itself, I don’t believe I am too fond of its style."
B,5,A perfect action film. No notes.
No Name,5,This movie was pure adrenaline from start to finish.. loved it!
No Name,4,"Probably one of the best action movies ever. I'd recommend it, especially if you're really into this kind of genre."
No Name,5,Excellent and captivating cinematography. Top tier action and story accompanied with excellent pacing. An immersive adventure off originality. Exceeds the original films in everyway.
No Name,4,This movie is so good. Highly entertaining and the performances are awesome. My guy Tom Hardy kills it!
No Name,5,It couldn't be more peak than this.Absolute cinema!
No Name,1,Just saw the Space Ice version and you gotta be forkin' kiddin' me.
No Name,5,"Absolutely exhilarating, and endlessly entertaining. George Miller's masterpiece of death and destruction will stand strong for years to come thanks to awesome characters and amazing practical effects that most of Hollywood has forgotten about by now."
No Name,4,"Filme foda, o roteiro é legal, o vilão é bacana, mas o que torna o filme melhor são as cenas de ação que são muito excelentes, que passam em um deserto de areia gostei do tom hardy como mad max, gostei da participação da cherlize theron como furiosa, gostei de uma cena em que o maluco estava segurandobuma guitarra enquanto saia fogo pelos canos pelo caminhão, as cenas de dialogo algumas foram boas e outras não, mas com tudo isso, eu recomendo muito esse filme, esse foi o melhor da franquia mad max."
No Name,4.5,"Direção: Bom
Atuação: Bom
Roteiro: Ok
Caracterização: Bom
Soundtrack: Bom"
No Name,5,"As good as any movie I have ever seen, amazing."
No Name,3,"Not special story in whole, similar endings have been seen many (in different locations depending the script). Beginning is interesting and endures as such quite well but not till end. On my opinion."
No Name,5,"I loved it. George Miller turned the desert into an absolute battleground with high-stakes action sequences and some genuinely likable characters: Furiosa is a powerful warrior who wants to redeem herself for serving Immortan Joe, the movie's amazing villain; Nux is insecure about his impending death and wants to go out in a literal blaze of glory; and the titular Max is as cool as ever, learns to open up to others, and the speech he gives when all seems lost was just perfect.

It hurts to know this masterpiece was a nightmare to make and how badly it financially underperformed. I honestly think the movie warranted a PG-13 rating; the goriest part was probably the villain's death, it was totally bearable for a modern teenage audience. But hey, the fact that a sequel was even greenlit sparks a little hope. Mad Max lived, it died, and lived again. Fury Road will ride eternal, shiny and chrome."
No Name,5,My favourite movie of the past decade.  Larger than life and twice as fun.
No Name,5,La mejor película de la década.
No Name,5,The post apocalyptic film of our age. Nuf zed.
No Name,4.5,"The Perfect Adventure Film.

Thrilling and original - that's how you can describe this film in two words. George Miller's style may not be everyone's cup of tea,and some may not understand it, but this is true cinema. With minimal dialogue and a huge amount of action, the film still manages to remain genuinely deep."
No Name,4,This is a great film that I had to rewatch after seeing Furiosa because the first time I watch it I was lost about what this was about; Furiosa was such a great introduction of the franchise to new viewers that this is perfect sequel to it. I loved it more and appreciated after Furiosa so stellar job perfect action film to enjoy; hopefully they make a third one to end this saga of soft reboot.
No Name,5,"I don’t think I’ve ever seen this much intense action in one movie. Just wow. I wish Gibson could have played the title guy, but Hardy does it great. And Miller somehow creates this insane future world that is believable, scary, and fascinating. Sci-fi does not get any better."
No Name,0.5,I really don't understand how this movie is rated so high. I was hoping that it wouldn't be any worse than Thunderdome. It's like Mad Max Meets The Rocky Horror Pic Show. I've never not finished watching a movie and am highly disappointed that I sat thru the entirety of Fury Road. Never will watch it a second time.
No Name,4,"Did not expect to love it, got persuaded by a friend to see it. 

Some of it I found kinda gruesome and hard to watch but overall I really enjoyed it and I LOVE Furiosa."
No Name,5,"Arguably, the greatest action movie ever made.
The movie is full throttle from start to finish. It never gets boring and leaves you wanting even more. A must see."
No Name,5,"A perfect action film. Great cast, practical effects, not too long, intense and memorable scenes, and just enough story to glue it together. Don't bother with Furiosa, it's a cheap imitation of this film."
No Name,4.5,Fury Road perfectly captures the harsh and epic nature of the franchise while also introducing the most gorgeous portrayal of Australia to date.
No Name,5,"An action masterpiece. Easy must watch if you enjoy the Mad Max universe/saga and some good ol' action. Sure, not having Mel Gibson as Max is sad, but Tom Hardy really delivers. Talking about delivering, Charlize as Furiosa is *chef's kiss*. Solid story, great acting and awesome action scenes! 
10/10 action movie. Watched many times."
No Name,4.5,"Great movie! I have no clue how they tie into the original three with Mel Gibson, but great action and story. I could do without the guitar guy though lol"
No Name,5,"Not perfect but what would perfection be in an apocalyptic setting?  As far as action movies go, nothing remotely compares to this. A remarkable piece of art depicting the best and worst of the animal human."
No Name,5,A mondern classic.
No Name,5,"If you’re a fan of the franchise or new to the series, this film is a great experience that stands out as one of the best action films I’ve seen in a long time."
No Name,2,"I dont really know why people likes mad max that much. Actors and animators did really great job, but um, the director should have contributed a little more to the film's script, because its a : escape-fight-drive-escape-fight-drive pattern, nothing more. I got bored halfway through the movie. Bored in the ACTION movie..."
No Name,5,"Wow. Great dip into Mad Max present day, fleshed out. Did such a great job with all of the elements. Edge of your seat action the entire film. Sometimes there is so much going on you feel like at a grand finale of fireworks."
No Name,5,Mad max en su más pura escencia!!!
No Name,5,"This movie really is perfect. The pacing is amazing, the action is perfect, costumes, cinematography, literally everything. It’s very gory & gross but amazing nonetheless. Both Tom and Charlize couldn’t be any sexier in this, and they both give a perfect performance. I don’t particularly love action movies but this is one of my favorite movies of any genre. I just can’t recommend this enough."
No Name,4,"Good, but only a spinoff."
No Name,5,"Wow. This movie is amazing. Its very different to what you expect from the Mad Max franchise. But then compare Mad Max 1 with 2. Tom Hardy does a great job, even with very little to say. Charlize Theron really does lead this movie. This movie does a great job at setting up a new universe. Fast paced non stop entertainment. Love it"
No Name,5,"The finest movie you ever made, one that I’ve been waiting for for three decades or more.  The grand master didn’t let us down with this forever creation.  Tom Hardy was divine, one couldn’t ask for more from him."
No Name,5,The order of the novel is surprising
No Name,5,"One of the hardests things to do in cinema is tell a story without using words... And gosh, this one knows how to tell a tale. Two action scenes of 1 hour glued together with a 10 min break. Cannot recommend enough"
No Name,4,"Eventhough it sometimes felt it kind of dragged, I was pleasently surprised. I thought it was gonna be another Marvel type movies with the same type jokes and dialogue, but it was quite good!"
No Name,4.5,INTENCE ACTION YOU REALLY CAN FEEL THESPEED O THE CARS
No Name,1.5,"While I have a lot of admiration for Tom Hardy, even his talent can't save this one for me.

The movie feels like a relentless series of glorified action scenes that fail to establish any emotional connection.

The plot is almost non-existent, essentially boiling down to a prolonged chase for two-thirds of the film, only to reverse course and head back for the final act.

Despite the visually stunning spectacle and high-octane energy, the lack of a deeper narrative or character development leaves the experience feeling hollow and unsatisfying. The film's emphasis on action over substance ultimately detracts from its potential to be a truly memorable entry in the franchise."
No Name,5,"This is still one of the best action movies I've ever seen!
2 hours of exhilarating action and practical stunts with phenomenal performances from everyone. 

You must WITNESS IT!"
No Name,5,Hands down the very best action movie ever made in the entire history of cinema.
No Name,0.5,It's just action. No scenario. Nothing to think about. It's not worth its rating.
No Name,5,"An action movie opus. ""Witness!"""
No Name,5,Amazing! Brazil loved it!
No Name,1,"I saw it at the theater and walked out, I don’t walk out of many movies but it is simply terrible, not entertaining and I was bored.  I like Charlize Theron but it sucked.  By the way, I sat through the ending later because I had to see if it had a happy ending and it did, but it didn’t help, still was terrible!"
No Name,5,Melhor filme de ação dos últimos anos. Ele e John Wicky mas em termos de dimensão Mad Max é sem dúvida o melhor 🤩
No Name,3.5,"It was a novelty, now a classic"
No Name,5,"Honestly one of the only movies I think that completely outshines the originals. As awesome as they were at the time, they missed the absolute mayhem and carnage we are shown in the masterclass of effects. Obviously the time they were made plays a huge part, but this movie I believe just has better overall writing and characters. It is a must watch and each time I watch it I’m thoroughly in awe in what the team was able to accomplish in making this masterpiece"
No Name,5,Absolutely unbelievable! Complete insanity from start to finish. Maybe the greatest action scenes ever made with indescribable set design & cinematography. The world building is captivating. Themes of oppression impact emotionally.
No Name,5,They should make a Mad Max movie without Mad Max.  I would totally pretend to care about it.
No Name,4.5,"Really enjoyed this movie! One of the best action movies for sure. I understand that some may find this weird, but if you really look at it then you'll also find its brilliance in the world building and plot. It's pretty incredible that this movie actually has a well formed plot considering it's pure non-stop action throughout the entirety of the movie. Acting: 10/10.
Story: 10/10. Character development: 8.5/10. Action: 10/10. In my opinion this is a solid 9/10."
No Name,3.5,"Recently watched this again. Great story-telling, character development is pretty great. 

However, this harkened the departure from the character of Max. Until the second act he is really just a footnote, literally called ""Blood Bag"". His entrance as a main character is impressive, which to the quality writing and editing."
No Name,5,New classic. Best action movie ever.
No Name,5,The greatest car/action film ever made.
No Name,5,"No other movie like it, except the old ones. The only problem I had after watching was that I wanted more Tom Hardy. The themes are risks that pay off. Camera angles always being in the center, to the music being played by the villains. Stupendous! 5/5"
No Name,3,Not bad it was okay..
No Name,4,"8.5/10

That's it. That's my review."
No Name,5,"Wow. Just wow. A non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end. Well produced, acted and directed. My favourite film."
No Name,1,"The film can be summarized as follows: A group rebels at point A and tries to find refuge at point B. Pursued by angry individuals from point A, they encounter hostility along the way. Reaching point B, they are disappointed and decide to return to point A, facing the same adversaries again. The film is filled with excessive action and meaningless stunts, making it monotonous and repetitive. Save your time."
No Name,5,"Can't get tired of this movie! I have watched more than a dozen times and will watch many more. Don't get fooled by the length of it, the action and characters will keep you entertained for the whole 3 hours. SO GOOD!"
No Name,5,Perfect action film. Very exciting.
No Name,3,"Madness, Redemption and Octane. Commendable drive for what would be something that isnt. Lots of practical effects and action to distract you of the lack of character buildup"
No Name,5,More films like this please!
No Name,4.5,"Action packed and beautiful piece of art. You can tell a story not only with words , and thats what this movie does , similar to Max who doesn't speak much and yet says a lot, so does the movie with the stunning visuals and hidden meanings."
No Name,5,UTTER. MASTER. PIECE.
No Name,5,Absolutely great Rollercoaster ride from start to finish.
No Name,5,One of my all time favorites right here!
No Name,5,"Surprisingly, this turned out to be  the best Mad Max movie of them all."
No Name,5,So good I saw it twice.
No Name,5,Super cinematic. The whole movie is a chase but it's done very well even when the pacing slows down a Lil bit. Great storytelling. You could mute the whole movie and still visually follow the story
No Name,5,I have matched this movie dozens of times. I was hooked by the first three movies and awaited this movie with baited breath. I was not disappointed.
No Name,5,"Visually stunning and unique.  Great choice of actors.
Great soundtrack. Will watch again and again. 
If there is a definition of what apocalyptic movie should be."
No Name,2,If Santa Claus brother had a harem? This movie just sucks it's like someone said tell me the last 15 minutes of Road Warrior and made this movie out of that description but instead of a gas shortage it's a water shortage.
No Name,5,"The greatest film of the century hands-down,what else is there to say?"
No Name,5,"This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. It wastes no time getting to what makes movies great. Epic action,unique and creative world building, and it does a great job reflecting mankind in its most basic nature of savagery and survival. This film makes a mythology of characters who are all doomed regardless of their efforts, yet gives the audience a sense of hope against all odds through the most impossible of circumstances. This movie has a great music score and memorable imagery including the wonderful use of practical effects and the ingenuity of the iconic custom vehicles made for it. Truly one of a kind."
No Name,5,Masterpiece!!! Best action film
No Name,0.5,I hated this film so much that I went back and watched all the previous Max Mad films and then returned. It's still unwatchable. Utter rubbish.
No Name,1,"Don’t understand why this movie was rated so highly. Yes, the visuals are amazing but that’s as far as it goes. The infantile script and low grade acting are set against mismatched, grandiose music."
No Name,5,One of the greatest movies of all time.
No Name,3.5,Enjoyable.. Not as good as previous Mad Max entries but still enjoyable enough for hard core fans. If you're going to go I think it is better to spend the extra money for IMAX.
No Name,5,"A modern action masterpiece that strikes all the right chords and rocks all the right riffs. A few unnecessary gross-out moments aside, this is arguably as good as any 2000’s action movie has been, holding the title without a challenger in sight. Witness it!"
No Name,5,Everything about this movie is amazing
No Name,4.5,Fantastic action and cinematography. My only criticism is that Mel Gibson wasn't Max.
No Name,0.5,"What the hell was everyone else watching that this movie was so popular? The visuals and audio were great, but the characters and plot were unbelievably bad. No, I really mean that. Watch the movie again and try to imagine any actual human being being so unbelievably idiotic as the characters in this movie. ""Hey, we just escaped the bad guys by the narrowest of narrow margins. What should we do with our newfound freedom? I know, let's GO BACK SO WE CAN DO ANOTHER 20 MINUTE ACTION MONTAGE!""

For the love of all that is holy, this was a massive insult to the first two actual Mad Max films. It firmly belongs in a category with Thunderdome."
No Name,5,Pure octane high adrenaline spectacle. It's like doing drugs without the withdrawal but all of the ADDICTION! WITNESS MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
No Name,5,One of the greatest action films ever made.
No Name,5,Simply one of the best action movies (or any kind of movie) ever made.
No Name,5,Best action movie ever made. I’ve seen this movie 10+ times and it never gets old. There is not even a dull millisecond in this film. It is exhilarating and action packed from beginning to end. There is nothing else like it.
No Name,5,Love this word and miller is amazing as making it feel so real
No Name,5,This film is nothing short of brilliant. A top 10 of all time (I will die on that hill)!
No Name,3,I'm just not getting it (unfortunately). Everyone's raving about this. Over the years I've watched it twice. And came away disappointed twice.
No Name,5,Great move was blast! Will watch again
No Name,5,Loved the commentary and the world that was imagined what astonishing
No Name,4.5,I have to say I was pleasantly surprised well done prequel I enjoyed the acting good storyline nothing negative to say
No Name,5,Amazing action film. Definitely an improvement for the franchise. Wanted to purchase it right after watching at the theater.
No Name,4,"An amazing action film, some of the best looking action scenes I’ve ever witnessed."
No Name,3,"Great cast, great action. CT is too pretty and soft to be the menace that I believe she is supposed to be. TH has no connection to the MG character except his name. In many ways, this movie barrows the MM-TM just for marketing. An enjoyable 2-hour car chase, but definitely an oddity."
No Name,5,This is what I call an epic in action cinema.
No Name,1,I must have watched a different movie than everyone else. I can’t even express how stupid this movie is from start to finish
No Name,5,The greatest action movie ever made Not only does it have some of the best action ever but it also has deep and emotional moments this movie is just plain sick it makes me wanna go past the speed limit while playing eminem or heavy metal also my favorite part was the scene where mad max battles the guitar guy
No Name,5,One of the best action movies I’ve ever seen
No Name,5,One of the best action movies ever!!
No Name,5,"The tippy top of all action flicks.The visuals,sound,editing,acting are all perfect.This movie delivers in every way and taunts you with more.10/10 movie."
No Name,5,This is all you want from a movie call mad max
No Name,4.5,"This movie is one of the best I've seen in years, loved every piece of it! Not to mention the chasing scene with the brother in arms playing, that sequence was epic"
No Name,5,"I have never seen a film light my innocent eyes up with flames like this before. It changed my whole world. There is a distinctly animal instinct we all share, and this film lets this beast free. I can't believe how intricately destructive this film is to a sense of modern civility. Perhaps that is what it truly is to be mad, to live the way we do. For, we are all in this world just as mad as Max, and thank goodness for that. For now, I'm increadibly grateful we've got our regular old Joe leading our insane country in 2024, and not Immortan Joe. Beholding this film makes me incredibly grateful for a lot of things, and scares my darkest and far-reaching fears and nightmares away. For that, I can't thank George Miller and his entire crew enough."
No Name,5,"It gets better every time i watch it. awesome action scenes and perfect direction, music and cinematography"
No Name,3,"Can we admit how vastly overrated this film is? Its fine but no more than that. Yes it looks very pretty and yes theres good action and designwork going on, but that all there is. The cast are chewing the scenery more than in a Hammer horror and the characters and stpry are as deep and nuanced as a small puddle."
No Name,5,"I love this movie, production, set and acting is amazing"
No Name,5,"Pedal to the metal. Fantastic. When I first saw this in a cinema, the audience applauded at the end of the first 20 minutes which was kind of rare and astonishing"
No Name,5,Absolutely incredible of a film. Definitely in my top 20 movies of all time
No Name,5,One of my top 5 movies of all time!!! -211S
No Name,4.5,An absolutely thrill ride and a definite must watch!
No Name,5,"A superb continuation/semi-reboot of the post-apocalyptic Mad Max saga...and this one is truly masterful. Incredible acting, a gritty storyline and the most colorful characters we've yet seen in the series. This story sees familiar tropes from the previous movies, but builds world that has moved on far beyond the blasted landscape of the original trilogy. This movie cannot be missed."
No Name,5,Best looking 4k uhd Blu ray I have. Action sequences are greatest of all time.
No Name,5,Don't mind me just excitedly witnessing in preparation for next week.
No Name,5,"The unrivaled stunts, cinematography and still holds up on the rewatch before getting tickets for the latest installment. Brilliant movie and performances!"
No Name,3.5,"It was shot beautifully, Tom Hardy's acting wasn't the best."
No Name,5,YEEEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! Banger ass movie filled with non stop action!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!
No Name,2,"There's like no dialogue, it's like watching an MTV music video, just one huge chase through the wasteland with music and little character development. Contrast this mess to the older Mel Gibson Mad Max movies that actually had a story and deeper characters!  The cinematography is beautiful, eye catching, the action is on point too, but it's a huge disappointment if you want anything of substance. This is more like an eye candy type of movie, something just to show off a new TV's capabilities."
No Name,1,"What a wild movie that is absolutely amazi....dumb. Haha, I just did not get this movie at all. It feels like the director was high when he filmed this. Felt incoherent and pointless."
No Name,5,'We're going to the green place!'
No Name,1,"Terrible CGI, was Theron actually in the desert at all? Looks like bad studio lighting all the way through and the  cheapest CGI effects ever made. Why is no one mentioning this?"
No Name,5,"One love, one shot... Give it all you've got. The perfect action movie. For a 2hr car chase, I'm not sure anything comes close. Watch at half speed to lengthen/double your enjoyment. If you think my rating is wrong, you're right,... And by right, I meant wrong."
No Name,5,Tom Hardy te hace recordar a Medgizon la actuación del actor como Max es increíble la historia es muy buena tiene mucha acción
No Name,5,"Pulse-pounding and viscerally unforgiving, George Miller's undeniable masterpiece is as rich narratively as it is visually. Truly a modern classic in every sense of the word."
No Name,5,"Absolute gleeful fun in the most unhinged way, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" stands as one of, if not the absolute best, action movie made to date."
No Name,5,"Must watch!! 
This is a strong female lead of the year. Too bad it was over shadowed by WW. 
Fun, intense, edge of your seat action movie
Furiosa is truly a warrior!!"
No Name,4.5,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" é possivelmente o melhor filme da franquia até então, conseguindo trazer de volta a ação frenética do segundo filme e possuindo uma história cativante (como o terceiro). É também bastante interessante ver como o Tom Hardy consegue manter a essência de uma personagem tão icónica ao mesmo tempo que a torna uma personagem sua. Belos visuais, cenas de ação e um elenco invejável fazem deste filme um dos melhores do género."
No Name,5,"The film with the most beautiful photography I have ever seen.
The film doesn't give many explanations about the characters but you still manage to identify with that character. The film has some crazy settings. The villain manages to steal the show when he appears"
No Name,5,"Witness this intense and action packed battle on the road for home! As the Imperator Furiosa defies the oppressive Immortan Joe by stealing his wives and his war rig, she joins forces with the drifter Max Rockatansky to fight off Joe's War-boys in order to return to the Green Place. An epic in so many ways, we are thrown into a brutal, desert wasteland of violence and war, with a memorable cast of characters making it epic!"
No Name,5,"Future belongs to the Mad but not sure if the prequel Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga will belong anywhere, a sequel surely could be."
No Name,4.5,"This movie deserves everything that's been said. It has good characters but the action is more important. 2 hours of amazing action and car design, a nonstop car chase sound bad but man is it fun."
No Name,5,Absolutely stunning work of filmmaking. And even better in 3D!
No Name,5,"A modern classic, and a milestone in cinema history."
No Name,4,"Incredible in every way. The setting, the practical effects and almost no use of CGI, except for Furiosa's arm, the violence, the costumes and the design of the vehicles are AMAZING. Highly recommended"
No Name,5,"Damn, you're the most perfect action for them you can make for its purpose
Very entertaining and amazing action sequences, it left me wanting more, which means it did its job"
No Name,5,"YEP this lived up to the hype, seriously one of the best action movies I have ever seen"
No Name,5,"An awesome movie with awesome action, awesome characters and awesome special effects. All out, it's an awesome movie. Did I mention it's awesome?"
No Name,4.5,Stunning visuals and costume design.
No Name,5,My favorite action film
No Name,5,"Mad Max Fury Road is a spectacle in many aspects,despite not having a wonderful story, its chase scenes and its frenetic pace give the film a special touch, technically speaking the film is spectacular,beautiful in every way, in my opinion a truly splendid film."
No Name,5,It's brilliant! Not stop action!
No Name,0.5,"Utter cringe inducing garbage. Saw it with 4 friends, and we all thought the same. These reviews are mind boggling"
No Name,2,Only thing that makes the film respectable to this rating is due to the stunts all being done by the actors. Apart from that I can name at least 10 action films to better spend 1.5 hours of your time.
No Name,4.5,Really awesome movie. Usually I am not too much in action-centric movies but this one really nailed it.
No Name,5,One of my favorite films. This movie was great from start to finish. Worth watching over and over.
No Name,4.5,"Very good movie full of chaos and acton.
Recommended watch"
No Name,5,Unreal movie. Amazing cinematography and action the entire movie. Needs to be watched with a loud sound system and big TV. 10/10
No Name,5,"The film had to be watched full volume on a Bose sound system. The story, acting, music and because it was filmed mostly by stunts it was spectacular"
No Name,5,"The absolute peak of the Action genre, up there in the 1st place alongside Rambo First Blood and Die Hard. A modern masterpiece in all senses."
No Name,4.5,"""Welcome to the apocalypse. I hope u like leather."""
No Name,5,"A perfect movie and far-and-away the best action of the decade. So many original characters with underrated arcs, all the more impressive with lack of dialogue and short runtime. The awards speak for themselves when it comes to the editing and visual effects. Well worth the 37 year wait!"
No Name,1,Worse then Thunderdome.  I watched when it came out and didn't like it.  All this time later I keep seeing reviews on how great it is. So I watched it again over the weekend.  Still don't see to merit the strong reviews.  They should have ended with Road Warrior.
No Name,4.5,The type of film you can just unplug your brain and enjoy the ride.
No Name,0.5,"In the words of Anakin Skywalker, I don't like sand."
No Name,4,"Visually stunning and well acted, Mad Max: Fury Road proves that hope can lie at the end of the difficult roads we most often travel."
No Name,4.5,"This is a great story in the Mad Max universe. Charleze Theron shows she's willing to push her acting skills to the max, and portrays the heroine in a superb fashion. Hardy is equally as fantastic. Respecting the rather dull scenery while applauding the cinematography, it is what it is ... post-apocalypse world with everything going to hell."
No Name,5,I enjoyed the original Mad Max trilogy and It was very entertaining but nothing compared to this one. It was wall to wall action with no break. I've always liked Tom Hardy and he's equally compelling in this as Mel Gibson  It's definitely worth the watch.
No Name,5,"Absolute GOAT of a montage, effects, choreography"
No Name,5,"I like everything in this movie: scenes, music, dynamic !!"
No Name,5,"This is a story about ""girls help girls"" when these girls said to each other: ""We are not things"" and ""We are not his measure"", I was moved so much!"
No Name,5,"Mad Max Fury Road is one hell of a ride. From beginning to end this film is heart pounding. The action/choreography is fantastic and leaves you with one very big adrenaline rush all due to its fast pace. the pacing was very fast which worked well for this kind of story. Then there are the performances which are great. Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, and Nicholas Hoult where all great in this film with each one of seemingly becoming their characters rather than acting as them. In terms of direction George Miller shows off his abilities. Miller is amazing at making this steam punk dystopian world come to life. The fact that most of the visuals are made via practical effects is crazy. To add onto this, the cinematography and colors are great as well. Mad Max Fury Road is very fine filmmaking.

With all that being said I do find flaws in this film. The characters are pretty bland. The film is mostly fast paced however it does slow down at certain points to focus on it's characters. Characters like Furiosa, Max, and Nux were explored but, they weren't explored enough to make them particularly strong characters. They had the potential and when they were being explored it was great; however, they weren't fully explored/developed which is definitely the film's biggest flaw. The visual effects also looked a bit wacky and poor at times but that is more of a nitpick than an actual flaw. 

Mad Max Fury Road is from a visual and practical sense phenomenal with great themes and performances; however, it's characters aren't particularly it's strong point. Regardless, this is a fantastic film that I'll highly recommend."
No Name,5,Greatest Action Movie of All time. No Debate
No Name,4,"Great reboot and a great film for action fans. While I initially didn't care for Tom Hardy's performance, it kind of grew on me after a second watch. He has very little dialogue but really does seem mad and haunted by his past. I hope the upcoming Furiosa movie is similar to this."
No Name,4.5,"I liked this so much more that I thought I would. 
See it on a big screen. It is beautiful."
No Name,5,"Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron did a great job with this film, great action, good acting and very entertaining!"
No Name,2.5,Not really my thing. I found the undercranking (speeding up the frames) annoying and hard to watch. Thank you.
No Name,4.5,"One of the Best action movie in cinema. 
Breathe-taking third act! 
And widely immersive & a thrilling experience."
No Name,5,One of the best action movies of all time!!!
No Name,5,Love it. Still a classic
No Name,3.5,"The cinematography in this movie is beautiful. The Story, is good. The score is not to bad ether.  over all, it is worth a second watch."
No Name,5,"Nothing short of a spectacular miracle. It exceeds your expectations on every conceivable level and will likely remain the gold standard for action blockbuster filmmaking for decades to come. That George Miller could return to this franchise 30 years later and make a movie that could easily be the best ""Mad Max"" entry is not something anyone could have anticipated."
No Name,5,Maybe the greatest chase movie ever made!!!
No Name,5,"A Masterpiece.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
No Name,3.5,Definitely has the feel of Fallout New Vegas for any Fallout fans. The cheesy humor in some parts is chef's kiss. It made me feel nostalgia for a time yet to exist in our timeline.
No Name,4.5,"I was indifferent to the original Mad Max movie, and I remember being disappointed by it on several attempts to watch it, so I wasn't expecting much from this sequel. Was I wrong though! This movie is almost non stop action, and the story is both exciting and easy to follow. The special effects are first rate, and I soon became absorbed into the film's world. To be honest, the character's don't have a lot to say, and you mostly pick up the plot from riding with them on their journey. That's not a bad thing in this case, because the film's pace is such that there is no time for the verbose narrative often found in other movies. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes action movies because it is one of the best I have seen."
No Name,3,This is a test review
No Name,5,"All Time Classic. Pretty much everything about this is flawless. the only minor complaints is there isn't much character development with Max and dare I say it feels like he's not even the main character at certain points. Furiosa is incredible and the best thing in this. She outshines Max. Also, the fact they go back the way they came makes it feel a little bit like the escape of the first half was pointless to an extent but who cares. This is 2 hours of a straight adrenline rush and the most action packed of the franchise. I will say this is a hair beneath Mad Max 2 for me because while Hardy is really good as Max, Gibson is better. Also, Max had more development and focus and while the chases in this are amazing and incredible, the end of the second still I feel is slightly better. However, where the second can be a bit slow in the first half this floors it and never lets up the entire way. IT's really just personal taste at that point comparing this and 2. Watch it and decide for yourself!"
No Name,5,"There's an early scene where a metal bard riffs on a flamethrower-guitar for no reason other than that he can; already a highlight. It only gets better from there, and this action-packed romp has loads of great character development to boot. Just stellar."
No Name,5,Absolutely phenomenal movie! Amazing action and amazing sound the entire movie!
No Name,5,Exceeds expectations - surpasses original - award worthy George Miller (Max has the voice)
No Name,5,"Con todo lo que necesita una película de acción, un excelente guion, escenografía, música, vestuario, actuaciones. Una película perfecta 🍅"
No Name,5,97 % of tomatoes with all the silly fun you need after some hard work
No Name,5,"Awesome from start to finish.  Incredibly high energy, with amazing SFX and action scenes.  You genuinely feel like you're there behind the camera in the car next to them. Would watch again and again."
No Name,4,"Movie is a visual feast (if you're into machines just as I am) although it's fictional feels a very dark look into post climate crisis World, how it can sharpen class differences, sexual discrimination."
No Name,5,"Um dos melhores filmes que já assisti. A história te envolve e te prende do começo ao fim. 
Não arriscaria de forma alguma trazer uma sequência a essa refilmagem pra não estragar toda a beleza e adoração que o ""primeiro"" nós faz ter."
No Name,5,"cars, blood, action! and so much rock'n roll, i love it!
one of best movies of all time"
No Name,4,Although not much seems to happen plot wise the movie still provides some very entertaining action scenes.

No Name,5,Totalmente buena recomendable

No Name,4,"A great, I don't know, retelling?  Felt like it should have been mashed between Road Warrior and Thunderdome.  But great fun and worth a watch.  Will there be another?"
No Name,4,Everything in this movie is brilliant! Satisfying and crazy amazing! Recommend!

No Name,5,"At first, I hated it. It was so over-the-top stupid that I couldn't bring myself to finish it, until I did the Drinker and downed a bottle of Jack while watching. And now I can't get enough of this movie. Fury Road is a masterpiece in it's own right. Just don't take it too seriously. And get yourself a drink while watching it!"
No Name,4.5,"Black and Chrome edition. 

This may be the definitive version of Mad Max Fury Road."
No Name,2,I don't understand the hype
No Name,5,The sheer originality and creative facets of the story and the action must be seen! And Charlize Theron is a true BAD-ASS.
No Name,5,"Sarah Connor, Helen Ripley and Furiosa for top woman leads taking over the leading man."
No Name,0.5,I really have no idea why this is reviewed so well. A really poor film. Saw it in the cinema and couldn't believe all the reviews.
No Name,4.5,Like a comic book come to life.
No Name,3.5,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a mind-bending thrill ride that feels like Dune author Frank Herbert dropped acid and penned a contemporary action extravaganza—simply awesome! The film's relentless pace and imaginative world-building leave audiences craving more of its adrenaline-pumping energy. However, amidst the chaos, the lack of chemistry between Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron is apparent, and reading about their rumored off-screen discord adds a layer of intrigue to this explosive cinematic experience."""
No Name,5,"One of the best theatre experiences of my life. I almost immediately knew no home viewing could ever compare, and I am grateful for having gone to see it. This film is an action-packed joyride from start to finish. It is easy for franchises to fall short, but Fury Road raises the bar to a new level."
No Name,5,"Best action movie ever made, with amazing shots, characters, universe ambiention, and music. This is a must see."
No Name,5,"I love this movie so much because it highlights how the world is like after a apocalyptic event. It shows how humans adapt and how evil people can be. It also displays the consequences of people all being in a sort of cult (?) 

I enjoyed it so much. Though I wish it would have shown more of a background on The Wives. I also wished it didn't kill off Nux. I truly saw a character redemption for him."
No Name,4.5,One of the most entertainment and action packed post apocalyptic adventure that never feels like a snore 9/10
No Name,5,"Might be the best action movie ever made. Besides the opening narration and some quick plot starters, the entire movie is one continuous two-hour-long car chase across the lovely wasteland. While watching, you are completely transported to a new world and can see and feel the real stunt work, the apocalyptic vehicles, and you are just left to marvel at it all and live on the edge of your seat in the process. It's impeccably shot and edited and scored and the main protagonists in Charlize Theron (Imperator Furiosa) and Tom Hardy (Max Rockatansky) are just a badass pair. You get the feeling George Miller did everything he ever wanted in a Mad Max film with his imagination and love, and maybe ended up making the best action/chase movie of all time.

No Name,4,"Some of the best action sequences put to the big screen are found in this movie. The visuals and costumes are stunning and impossible to take your eyes off of. The story is fun, but not very deep or enthralling, but that's not what you want to look for in this film."
No Name,0.5,"The worst film I've ever watched, boring and horrible storyline"
No Name,5,"The film has a touch similar to Zack Snyder's works, but with greater cinematic maturity. It's a seventh-art wonder, with electrifying scenes and deep performances. I dare say that it is somewhat feminist, which I like very much. I had the opportunity to see it recently in black and white and I was pleasantly surprised. What a show!"
No Name,5,This is one of the best movies I've seen in the past 10 years
No Name,3,"Very far from the classic Mad Max. The actor (Tom Hardy) was very good as Max, but the enviroment and story was horrible. A lot of action, ok, can´t disagree, but unfortunelly i cannot recommend this movie. Could be a lot better."
No Name,5,This movie it's a lesson on cinematography and editing for action movies. It is just masterful crafted
No Name,5,"Total insanity from start to finish, awesome."
No Name,5,"A gripping, visually stunning and laconic masterpiece!"
No Name,5,An average day in america
No Name,0.5,"i would give this movie 0 stars if i could i wish it was never made so boring and whenever a character died i did not even care infact i wish every character in that movie died so i could finish it i had more enjoyment watching a clock change time than watch this movie.I can describe this movie in 3 words TRASHY DUSTY NASTY IF you want to watch a movie about cars than watch fast and furius its dookie 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩 the camrea angles wore horrible if you have bought this 20 DOLLER MOVIE I AM SORRY FOR YOU the worst part is that it costed $154.6–185.1 million to make somone could have used that for somthing good but no they used it for this horrible movie  the acting is cheesy and the script is as good as a baby talking into a microphone they filming looks like it is filmed from a dusty windsheild making a nasty looking film too. I think you could have guesed that this movie sucks cause of its boxoffice making only 1,300$ i could make from a year of working at subway . Every one tells me that this is a masterpeice but it is pure rotten eggs on a stick out of all movies that could have been made you hade to rip off of fast and furrius a real movie why could they have not made a movie about space or trains they made another poorly made ripof    (3) DO (2) NOT (1) WATCH"
No Name,5,Perhaps one of the best executed movies of all time. Very rare that a movie is able to be a visual feast. Great directing and practical effects.
No Name,5,Pure visual action mastery.
No Name,5,"How does this have an RT audience rating under 90%?

Don't watch this if you plan on sleeping in the next 48 hours, ‘cause you'll be too freakin pumped!"
No Name,5,The greatest action film ever made. Period.
No Name,4,A blessed hellride from start to finish.
No Name,5,The best action movie out there - it gives us visual thrills and momentous sequences without losing any of the flair or heart throughout. A HUGE step up from the original Mad Max trilogy as well.
No Name,4.5,"Gritty, well-written, well-characterized, smartly designed, and adventurously weird"
No Name,5,"While this movie may not be everyone's ""cup of tea."" This is an action movie Masterpiece in every way. So much effort was put into the creation of the cars, characters, the music, the ""wasteland."" Not a scene felt wasted in any manner. It just starts and gets straight to the point. It's amazing how they created every vehicle in this movie as well. The effort matches the movie. Every actor and actress played their roles to the upmost of their ability. Amazing. Watch it."
No Name,5,This Movie is a Masterpiece!  George Miller is the Goat (Greatest of All Time). I'm looking forward eagerly to the Prequel Furiosa.
No Name,5,"One of the best movies of 2015, and one of the best action movies in years.
George Miller has given us an adrenaline fuelled, non-stop dose of mayhem and action that is arguably better than the original."
No Name,2.5,"Good movie. Nice performances. But nothing over the top. The movie could easily be called ""George Fury Road"" and still be that movie. What I mean is that they should leave Max the character and introduce another one. It was more of an action movie rather than a tense fils like the previous 3 were.
The bad thing is that they are not revisiting the characters that were already introduced in the old movies and make a prequel that would show their stories ."
No Name,5,"SPOILERS This apocalyptic fiction follows Max, a man coping with the death of his wife and child, who is captured by a group of survivors (more like lunatics), loyal to the tyrannical Immortan Joe. When Furiosa takes Joe's five wives in the War Rig to bring them East to their liberty, max is dragged along in an insane adventure full of monster trucks, explosions, fire, death, bullets, gas, gas and more gas. 

This is peak fiction. The apocalyptic desert that is depicted, the design of the war machines and costumes, the character arcs, fire, explosions, scale... its an action-fuelled masterpiece. The world Miller has crafted is so erratic, chaotic and octane filled - its insane and beautiful. A wasteland where humans treat gas like a god, completely obsessed with badass-looking vehicles and meeting their death on the road. I wanted more when the credits rolled, more time to explore this eccentric world and its characters. For lack of a better term the shit in this movie is strait up cool. Like look at the concept art for vehicles, the costumes and the landscape - and tell me its not fucking cool! The production design reminds me of Blade runner, not because it is at all similar, but because it is visually striking, unique, imaginative and captivating. They have created a world here which is not ours, a fictional world with nuances and touches that make it wonderful to get lost in. 

It was essentially non-stop action for two hours, and it never got old or boring, just high stakes over and over and over. The war rig was practically a character in itself and the battles moving at high speed will be forever etched in my mind. Two hours of strait action and I could have done with two more. There was some very credible and satisfying character arcs here as well amidst the explosions. Nux is absolutely the most notable. At the start of the film I hated this man and his people for their octane filled delusions of Valhalla and blatant insanity, but by the end I saw Nux as a man who put his life on the line for who he now considers friends. He escaped from the lies and oppression Joe was feeding his people. It was a powerful character transition and death. Max's relationship with Furiosa and the wives is a pleasure to see unravel and become somewhat friendly at the end too. 

One thing I really like about this film too is how it doesn't give you any exposition or explanation for the wasteland, factions, people, and how they came to be. At first I was confused (I haven't seen the originals), but I came to realize that them not opening the film up with some expedited narration, or exposition from the characters - makes it so much more intriguing and enthralling. The creators don't owe first time watchers an explanation as there's tons of previous movies and lore, and I like how we are not ‘babied' into this world, but simply taken along for the ride. 

Overall, Mad Max combines masterfully imaginative production design, world building, characters and gas to create one of the best action films I've ever seen."
No Name,4.5,A great reboot of Mad Max franchise with ideas of cars and trucks demonstrating through desert. Thrilling and keep you engaged with this action film until the end.
No Name,4.5,"In a visually stunning and consistently fast-paced action film, the characters are developed through the depiction of their nature, their decisions and their behaviour. No explanations or dialogue are required, as every detail of each character and the environment already tells a complete story."
No Name,1,"Okay - so which version did all the positive reviewers watch?  It can't have been this one.  The movie's plot was 'let's drive into the desert and then drive back again'. Oh and car chase, crash, fire, stupid 'heavy metal' guitar, Charlise Theron, some ugly dude being dystopian (or something) and - well that's it.  I was bored."
No Name,4,"One of the only ideologically driven movies made in the last 8 years that actually manages to stay entertaining.  It's a bit of a circus ride, but that's kind of what you want in a Mad Max movie, no?"
No Name,5,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one of my favorite films ever experienced, depicting action and violence of a deadly high-speed chase throughout the wastelands, dealing with survival over humanity, feminism, and an anti-hero haunted by visions of his deceased loved ones."
No Name,2.5,"I am aware that they had to re-cast Max due to Mel being old, but it still felt sacrilegious. They didn't need to make this movie. it has its scenes that look cool, especially the early chase scenes. But max is largely a background character in a movie named after him."
No Name,5,"The world building is brisk, and vast and the action is just stunning. This ones a must  see."
No Name,5,"Simple yet complex, I struggle to find the right words for this film."
No Name,5,This is my favourite f***ing movie of all time.
No Name,5,best movie ever ! perfect action movie
No Name,1.5,"I really don't get it: such a bad movie, boring, just pure violence, no real story behind, and have such a rating, it is totally non-understandable! So much b*llsh*t."
No Name,5,An extremely fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping action movie that you can't take your eyes off of. A great watch!
No Name,5,"Its bloody gorgeous in cinematography, action, pacing, editing, acting what more could be said every shot in this movie could be a desktop background tell you what its definitely on my desktop background slideshow. They knew what they wanted to do with this movie the passion seeps through the screen in the most testosterone filled way I've ever seen. Few say that the plots too basic and the lore isn't explained at all, yeh and? The film makers are leaving it up to interpretation, their showing glimpses rather than telling all. Its like drawing on dotted lines to complete the drawing it's why we're shown glimpses of Max's past we don't fully know what happened but it's up to us to put the pieces together. It says a lot without showing too much throughout this entire movie. What else can I say that hasn't already been said? this is a perfect action movie the best of the 2010s in my opinion."
No Name,4.5,Entertaining movie that does the franchise justice.
No Name,3.5,Good visuals lift up what is otherwise a series of action sequences loosely tied together with an ill-defined protagonist. I'm aware that is appealing to some but I'd rather have clear motivation for the plot to be progressed opposed to grunting and mumbling.
No Name,5,"A magnificent, visceral, dystopian, post apocalyptic, dark beauty. Mad Max 2 was argueably the post nuclear action drama pinnacle, purely for the impact it made by literally spawning the genre. It was often copied but ironically only ever equalled once and that was by this. Its as though the pinnacle of the genre was given a massive dose of steroids and told you said its mother was a whore. A true, snarling, angry, spiritual successor that surpasses everything before it in terms of sheer spectacle. Utterly magnificent and easily sets a new gold standard in terms of live action carnage. The cast all do their jobs superbly. Theron layers her performance beautifully and Hardy provides a near monosalabic, worldweary, yet expressively wide physical performance. . wonderful. Very close to the top of my all time favourite films list and bang at the top for post armageddon dystopia. Treat yourself, watch Mad Max 2 and then this for the ride of your life.
""Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!"""
No Name,4.5,Mad Mix is an entertaining movie that delivers on both the action and comedy fronts. The storyline is good
No Name,5,Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron in post-apocalyptyc Australia + non stop gruesome action and despair. What's not to like!
No Name,2.5,Tocky on a Saturday night
No Name,0.5,If you liked this movie you are dumb
No Name,4.5,"I feel like Mad Max: Fury Road will grow on me more as time progresses.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I have it at an 88/100 but I think that upon one or two rewatches, it could make me greatest of all time list."
No Name,5,100 best movie ever made
No Name,5,One of the best action movie
No Name,3.5,"I didn't what to make of this movie after knowing this was made by the same director as the previous films. This movie was strongly hyped and regarded highly but I wanted to see the original films first. Within ten minutes I realized something, this isn't a sequel, but a reboot, with a new Mad Max, like the Daniel Craig Bond movies replaced the previous Bond movies.

A dystopian world that ran low on resources had led Max Rockatansky to become a once respectable lawman into a road warrior in a post-apocalyptic world who gets caught up in a fight for his life. Captured and used for resources gets involved in a violent warlord's attempt to reclaim his offspring in five innocent expecting women taken from his care by a vicious but courageous female general known as Furiosa. Max escapes from the warlord only to run afoul of Furiosa's mission but slowly but steadily gain each other's trust. But the warlord will not give up until he obtains his offspring as Furiosa and Mad Max take the fight to the warlord.

I got to say I loved the previous Mad Max movies with all my heart, and just as Sean Connery will always be James Bond to me, Mel Gibson will always be Mad Max. Tom Hardy is fine but he doesn't have Mel's intensity and charisma. The real star of this movie is Charlize Theron who is amazing as an Amazonian-type character Furiosa. Not as feral as I heard described, but smart and brave as well as strong. George Miller should make more movies with her. All things considered a good movie, but not as great as the previous movies."
No Name,4.5,"Mad Max Fury Road has always been that one blockbuster of the last 10 years, that just looked like something that isnt for me and boy was I wrong. Mad Max Fury Road follows a group of unknown people of each other, trying to find a way to fulfill hopes and dreams. While I have not seen the original 3 movies, the story is still really understandable, however I must say, I definitely was a bit lost the first 10-15 minutes. Mad Max Fury Road has some of the most impressive practical effects ever put to screen, combine that was sublime VFX and you get some of the most gripping action ever. While Mad Max Fury Road has build its reputation of being an action movie, the movie certainly has so much more to offer storywise. George Miller his direction is fantastic, very stylisch editing and colors, but still remaining it grounded. The movie has some top notch make-up and hairstyling, score and incredible sound design and mixing. Mad Max Fury Road is definitely one I will be revisiting in the future, however then I am going to check the older movies out as well!"
No Name,5,"It's a crazy and grand movie, Mad Max: Fury Road, the 4th one, a 2015 Australian post-apocalyptic action film co-written, co-produced, and directed by George Miller  AO...

This stars, Tom Hardy as the leading character, Mad and also Charlize Theron as the brilliant actress..."
No Name,5,This movie is the definition of crazy and done right.
No Name,3,"Just recently watched it for the first time. It kept replaying on one channel. It was pretty good. I know about the original Mad Max films, but I've never watched one the entire way through. It piqued my interest in the franchise as a whole, so I would call that a success."
No Name,5,Absolutely phenomenal.
No Name,5,"A spectacular and innovative addition to the Mad Max franchise, easily the best of them with its larger and more dramatic look and plot."
No Name,5,"My absolute favorite movie of all time. From the first shot to the last it is a bizarre (in all the best ways), high-octane chase scene which also effectively portrays character motivation and real bonding between the leads. The most amazing part of the film is that all the stunts are practical effects - not CGI. Of course, the dust storm scene has CGI, but the motorcycles, the monster trucks, the explosions, the running back and forth on the big-rig: all of is done as real stunts, and they look great. Best action movie, best chase film, ever made. Just sit back and enjoy. And don't worry about understanding the dialog. There isn't any.  ;)"
No Name,5,"Um dos melhores filmes de ação dos últimos tempos. É uma categoria de longa metragem que já estava devendo qualidade, mas conseguiu se redimir com essa pérola. Destaque para a ""teoria de internet"" em que coloca o Max de Tom Hardy com um vínculo muito mais profundo com o Max de Mel Gibson."
No Name,4.5,One of the best movies made this long after the originals. Creative and amazing effects
No Name,5,Absolutely ICONIC! Um clássico instantâneo
No Name,5,A spectacle that I'm so thankful I saw in theaters.🔥
No Name,5,Top 20 best movies ever.
No Name,5,"The best movie ever made! With the best directing from George Miller! Plus, the best editing ever done in a movie! Also, the best production design ever made in a movie! As well as the best makeup and hairstyling ever done in a movie! Not to mention the best sound mixing ever done in a movie! Not only that, but the best sound editing ever done in a movie! And the best stunt coordination ever done in a movie!"
No Name,5,"With tight direction and a fresh story, Fury Road brings Mad Max back in what is its most well-crafted, exciting and magnificent installment that goes mad in its action and never gives up."
No Name,3.5,"'Max Max: Fury Road' was a thunderously engaging film, including non-stop action and stunning aesthetics. But, although the film had so much potential, it ultimately fell short. I wanted the movie to work so much, but it couldn't deliver a proper story in the end. This picture could be seen as what happens in a child's imagination after watching 'The Book of Eli.' The characters lack adequate motivations and are somewhat restricted by the script. We know very little of their stories or how things came to be, but if you care little for understanding a film and would rather watch skull-crushing non-stop action, with stunning editing, and 'Lord of the Rings' level costume and set design, this is the picture for you."
No Name,1,Worst of the franchise was mad max even in it
No Name,4.5,"Great reboot of Mad Max. It worked because of the George Miller's top notch cinematography and the stellar all star cast: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough... If you didn't get to see this movie in the theaters, you definitely missed out on a masterpiece because Miller created special visual/audio effects that only works in theater."
No Name,0.5,A pointless movie. Lots of car wrecks and blood and failed attempts at artistry.
No Name,2,"Big on stunts and effects weak on acting, dialogue, world or character building. Simply watch for the stunts but if you are looking for something interesting, seek life elsewhere"
No Name,2.5,"I truly don’t understand the acclaim for this one. There is little to no exploration of the struggle the world is going through at this time. Not does it even hesitate to explore into any of the character’s backstories. We’re just thrown into the plot very quickly with balls to the walls action from start to finish. The action was top notch and the scenery of the desolate world was cool. I just didn’t connect to the characters or any aspect of the plot, leaving this one ringing hollow for me"
No Name,5,Possibly my favorite movie of all time. Could not recommend more highly.
No Name,5,A masterpiece from start to finish. A simple plot that tells a thousand stories. Stuntwork unparalleled. If you like action even a little bit you have to see this movie. This movie has zero flaws.
No Name,4,"How the original Mad Max might have looked with a big budget and modern technology. Action scenes are great, sound design and visuals are A+. However, the soundtrack is very unmemorable, and I don't know if Hardy works as Max, at least if you prefer the original version of the character."
No Name,5,"Honestly, when i saw the movie's cover i was skeptical and when i fired it up on HBO, it grabbed me from the very beginning. 

There was not a single moment of the movie where i was bored.
I would totally recommend it."
MD,2.5,"Sorry all ! Watch the original Mad Max movies with Mel Gibson instead,,,they are much better than this. Charlize is good, Hardy is nonexistent…and one long chase is a bit overkill. Road Warrior is sooooooo much better!"
No Name,3.5,"Film d'azione da manuale.
Probabilmente uno dei film d'azione meglio riusciti.
Messa in scena unica, con costumi incredibili, sceneggiatura perfettamente allineata al contesto scenografico, gran cast, con un Tom Hardy a livelli molto alti.
Un George Miller in grande spolvero."
No Name,4,Entertaining movie. Plot was mediocre but the action and characters got us through to the end. The cast did a great job in their roles and delivered some good characters
No Name,3.5,"Tom Hardy, no doubt, has a powerful presence, but it seems that Cherlize Theron dominated the movie, which puzzles me as to why the title ""Mad Max: Fury Road."" It should have been called ""Mad Furiosa: Fury Road."" Hopefully, Tom Hardy will do another sequel and it will be more about his character! Otherwise, don't entitle the movie Mad Max! He's amazing to watch and very entertaining but it seems to me he took a backseat in this one. Nothing against Theron but now I can understand why there may have been some conflict between the two of them. Theron is an amazing performer but I was hoping to see more of Hardy. Just my opinion! Kudos should go out to the rest of the cast, though. They were all wonderful and I can understand Theron being frustrated making this movie because all I saw was desert and more desert. I would have gone berserk! However, I would hope that Mel Gibson would be proud of Hardy for what he was able to contribute to this movie!"
No Name,0.5,"This movie was not as advertised!  No real character development, bad special effects, and a huge bait and switch.  People wanted a Mad Max movie not a Charlie Theron action movie!  I can't believe this shit has such a high score on this site!!!"
No Name,3.5,"Premise and execution more ridiculous than Waterworld, but a very entertaining action movie if you don't think too hard about the Australian coast being only max 66.7 hours away at 30 kmph. 6.8/10 - Not quite good but more than adequate."
No Name,4.5,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
No Name,3,"The acting was solid. Strong performances from everyone. However, it was sad to see the title character take a backseat in his own movie. The movie should have been called Furiosa."
No Name,3.5,"Gorgeous visuals paired with non-stop action that was well choreographed, it's guaranteed to be a good time but nothing past that. The acting is very mid, as whilst it's not bad there's nothing specially unique or memorable about it, with even Tom Hardy admitting to not trying very hard during press conferences. The action is of course the highlight, and it's full of unique and memorable moments, just nothing that can redeem the pretty basic story of a point to point end goal, as everything that aren't fights or battles feel like exposition for the fights, leading to the ending and any attempt at emotion feeling lost as it comes off as too forced and I just can't care much about the characters other than Max and Furiosa."
No Name,4.5,"As an audio/video set piece, it succeeds with great splendor.  I applaud the method of storytelling, using visuals and minor character dialog to explain things instead of railroading the viewer into forced storytelling where every single thing has to be spelled out.  They leave things up to interpretation, as more movies should.  Let people internalize things differently, sometimes that can be more interesting and feels more personal.  I feel strongly compelled to re-buy this movie in 4k, the visuals were already fantastic in 1080p but I can only imagine in HDR.  Also this movie has some incredible atmos implementation, don't skip this if you're a home theater enthusiast!"
No Name,4.5,Charlize Theron is amazing in the lead role and the movie keeps you at the edge of your screen right till the end. Direction is good and so is the writing.
No Name,0.5,"Movie had absolutely no plot at all, script was horrible, and the acting was very bad. I have no idea how there are this many good ratings for such a horrible movie"
No Name,5,It was part way through when I recognized the form. Fury Road is an opera - albeit without any singing. The whole Valhalla thing; It was Wagnerian with music used very effectively. Thoroughly enjoyable with some lovely moments of frisson.
No Name,5,Great visuals and suspense - like all the MadMax movies should be. Respect for people like George Miller that stay true to their vision of an end result.
No Name,5,"It is one of the best action movies of all time. Beautifully shot, minimal dialogue but still an emotional story, unbelievable stunts. It is definitely in the top 5 action movies ever and for me it is tied for #1 with Terminator 2."
No Name,5,"Masterpiece of cinema, passage, photography, sound and many spectacular details"
No Name,5,"This is almost a perfect movie.  It is over the top and accepts it, yet still somehow stays serious.  Mad Max knows what it is and doesn't try to be something different.  Visually amazing, and a nice nod to the 80's movies while being its own thing.  Loved it."
No Name,5,"This movie has non-stop action but its stimulating, energetic and never feels exhausting or monotonous. The score is absolutely breathtaking in tone. Watch this one on a big screen with decent audio if you can."
No Name,3,"It's really well made and any individual 20 minutes of it are great, but it's also kind of one long action scene and by the end it's really hard to be at all invested.  I probably should have broken this one into chunks and watched it over a few days, I think that's what I'd recommend."
No Name,5,An earnest and technically masterful post-apocalyptic action film that's rich in themes and visuals.
No Name,5,One of the lifetime.
No Name,4.5,"Instant classic. Tom Hardy is excellent, and the rest of the cast are also all amazing. Wonderfully directed and shot."
No Name,5,"An Action Masterpiece. There are a couple of parts during the high adrenalin moments where the cinematography and music are so spot on, I actually tear up. I still cant explain why, but I know when something works, it works."
No Name,5,This movie is just gold. Action. World building. Visuals. Acting. Sound track. Just an amazing must watch film.
No Name,3,"Mad Max delivers as an action movie. But those calling it an ""instant classic"" need to calm down. Mad Max is a visually imaginative, pulse-pounding spectacle, but it certainly has none of the subtle, all time great acting performances that made films like The Godfather true film classics that appeal to nearly everyone. Mad Max is unique enough to set itself apart from the usual action flick, but the story isn't that great."
No Name,4,"The action alone is what makes this movie, which is directed very pristinely for the most part. It really slowed down in the middle but other than that it was entertaining. While I couldn't get behind other characters as much and wasn't entirely on board with the Universe and the craziness surrounding it, I didn't feel like I needed to! I still liked Tom Hardy's character quite a bit though. It's one of the better action movies I've seen for sure!"
No Name,5,"Action! action! action! This movie is just a gift that keeps on giving. A masterpiece, with so much re-watchability."
No Name,5,"There is a beauty to this movie that I keep coming back to. An assurance that even a wasteland can be heartbreakingly beautiful, that humanity can exist even in the most dire of circumstances. Civilization begins when we stop treating one another as things."
No Name,4,Probably the greatest Action Film of All time the film has great action a good story but its problem is Development in its characters and its lack of back story
No Name,4.5,"Oh boy is this an acquired taste. Didn’t much care for it after one viewing but after a rewatch, it became quite apparent that this is an amazing film. 95/100"
No Name,2,"If you like non-stop action in the form of never ending chases, fiery explosions, savage killings and general mayhem, Mad Max: Fury Road is probably right up your alley.  If you like movies with meticulously developed characters, a compelling story and intelligent dialogue, you should probably take a pass on George Miller's most recent installment in the franchise.  The stunts and special effects are remarkable and much of the cinematography is excellent, but the continual parade of bodies flying through the air, vehicles exploding in balls of flame and characters mumbling incoherently grows repetitive after a short time, making it an exhausting experience at best.  Despite the widespread praise that's been heaped on Fury Road, it's clearly not for all tastes."
No Name,5,"Como amante de las películas de acción, esta obra de arte es un ""must"" en la lísta de cualquier cinéfilo. Desde principio a fin tiene una dosis extremadamente alta de acción. No hay muchos diálogos... pero a quién le importa cuando no hay tiempo para ellos. Fantástica ambientación post-apocaliptica i desarrollo de la trama. Sin duda: ¡Excelente!"
No Name,4.5,The style of this is incredible
No Name,0.5,I love Tom Hardy but even after watching it for the 4th time I don't understand what's happening
No Name,5,Mad Max: Fury Road; a critically acclaimed action film that not only breaks away from  standard genre norms but does a near flawless job. The film uses theatrical mise en scene to create a completely unique over the top dystopian world.
No Name,4.5,"Great movie! Tons of epic action and chase scenes, fantastic and very well developed world building, and some really good characters. Very well edited, very good special effects and practical effects, and some very realistically gritty fight scenes that are fun to watch."
No Name,0.5,"This movie is terrible! Script, plot, acting, sound design, action sequences are all awful. I'm not getting that 2 1/2 hours of my life back."
No Name,4.5,"Man oh man, oh man! What a action-packed, visually stunning ride this was! You never had a chance to catch your breath for scene after scene. This was a real shock to the system. I had seen all the old Mad Max movies but this one went off like a supernova and keep eating up the screen. My favorite, unexpected, character was the blind heavy metal guitarist flailing the desert during the pursuit with a wall of amps blasting out a battle soundtrack. What a hoot! Now the film basically does a full circle -- ending up where it started but what an audacious journey. Recommended, but don't let your little kids watch this as it is ultra-perverse violence throughout."
No Name,5,Greatest. Action. Movie. Ever. Made.
No Name,5,"The opening monologue given to us by Tom Hardy is probably one of my top 5 moments in film history. It's so well written and beautifully delivered and it goes so well with what's actually happening on the screen. What a great start to an even greater film!

I think one of the most unique and intriguing things about Mad Max: Fury Road as a whole is the way it's filmed. It's beautifully shot but it's very different from other movies. There's times where it'll speed up, and while the dialogue is at normal speed, the scene in the background is at 1.5x speed. Super unique and I love it!

This cinemaTOGRAPHY! Good heavens I'm in love with the colors and the angles and the shaky effect… gosh it is so visually pleasing. When I first watched this I didn't quite have my ""directors eye"" (as some might call it) but upon rewatch I'm absolutely in love with the camerawork in every scene. I can't get over this cinematography. The colors are just so stunning, especially when it switches from orange to blue. So so great.

The jumps and transitions between scenes is perfection. The pacing overall is actually amazing and I'd say that this is the most intricately timed film I've seen which makes watching super enjoyable.

I'm also in love with this score. It's at times rock music which gets you hyped but at other times it's an orchestra playing a somber song… perfectly split between exciting and devastating. The music itself is extremely emotional and will bring you into what the characters are feeling whether it be excitement or trauma. Let me reiterate this, the score is phenomenal. There's simply no other word to describe it.

An underrated(?) part of this film are the VFX! Every time a car would blow up or blood would spill I was blown away by how real it looked. You can tell a lot of time was spent focusing on the visual aspects but especially the visual effects!

No one could direct this the way George Miller did. Mad Max: Fury Road could only be written, produced, and directed by a mad man, and George Miller proved his worth. Arguably better than its predecessors, Fury Road is revolutionary. It's a film that could bring you into the realm of film, as it is perfect in near every aspect. It will make you love cinematography, will show you what a films score can really be, provides a wonderful example of the different forms of acting, and so much more. I somehow forgot how good this film really is. Absolutely amazing, 10/10!"
No Name,4,"Lo que hace impecable a esta versión de ""Mad Max"" esta en como George Miller, desde el primer minuto da exposición a la historia que quiere contar. Sin enredar o alargar innecesariamente la trama. Donde desde los primeros 10 minutos dan foco a todo lo que va a ser fundamental en la trama, ya sean personajes locaciones y hasta cosas que parecen tan banales que en como avanza la historia se vuelven fundamentales, usando de una increíble manera el ""Es mejor mostrar que decir"", y en eso se basa la mayor parte la película, Buscando que en los planos mismos se desaten los sentimientos y el porque de las cosas, ya que en ellos recae todo el peso de la historia. Donde todos hacen un trabajo extraordinario entendiendo a los mismos. Ya sean los actores, los encargados de vestuario, los extras y los directores de cámara. Uniéndose de gran manera para crear una experiencia única. El mundo de Mad Max es interesante en todo aspecto. Esta película se a vuelto una de esas películas que cada vez se vuelven mas escasas, una película que busca la genialidad en el entorno, en donde se desarrollan los acontecimientos de la trama y de ahí partir para profundizar todo lo demás. Una película que enamora con la vista."
No Name,0.5,Honestly it's one of the worst films I've ever seen
No Name,4.5,"A movie full of details, with an incredible costume and wonderful performances, In addition, the cinematographic work is the most impressive in this work"
No Name,5,"I love this movie. By far the best mad max movie. Its violent, Tom hardy is great as max, and immortam joe is a cool villain. I loved this movie absolute must see."
No Name,5,What sounded like a terrible idea ended up being an absolute masterpiece that topped even The Road Warrior.
No Name,5,"It's amazing how this movie managed to surpass the old one. This movie brought a new Mad Max universe, with a post-apocalyptic world more extreme than just people going crazy. The new perspective of a world affected by nuclear devastation brought improvements to both the characters and the story."
No Name,3.5,"This movie was clearly a vehicle to introduce Charlize Theron as the next lead in the franchise. Otherwise, why does her role exponentially supersede that of Tom Hardy as the titular character.  Is this a great action movie? Yes. Is it thrilling with great action sequences and effects? Most definitely.  Pitfalls are the less than stellar dialogue and the forgettable supporting characters.  
But I guess we don't watch action flicks for their stellar dialogue or storytelling.  Oh well! It was at least entertaining."
No Name,5,I dont't understand why this had a mediocre box office result cause The Fast and Furious franchise is so suscessful it just dosen't make sense to me.
No Name,3,"Visually stunning and technically advanced it is, but I did not see much more than loud explosions and monster trucks in this film. It is certainly not bad, but I find it quite overrated."
No Name,3,"Unpopular opinion, I know, but I still prefer the original three films. 
Something was just missing somehow. Maybe this new one was too polished? Maybe it's how soft-faced Tom Hardy just doesn't come across as the Max Rockatansky we know from the originals. I do want the franchise to continue, but I'm not jazzed with the reboot so far.  
Maybe a TV series could work pretty well..."
No Name,5,uff una de las mejores películas de acción que he visto excelente.
No Name,4,"Except for a few well and obvious set up for Tom Hardy and I thought this show was going to become tawdry but as I got into the movie, I have to say that this was a very good chase movie with lots of explosions and a great ending.  I must say this is the best of the Mad Max series thus my *4* star rating!!!!"
No Name,4,"Like a lot of people I didn't really know what to expect with this reboot. But also as with a lot of people I was pleasantly surprised. 

The visuals in this movie are very well done and more than compliment the setting of a post-apocalyptical wasteland. Obviously taking the visual style of Mad Max 2 and giving it an enhancement with some borderlands vibes thrown in which I'm a big fan of.

My only true peeve is that Max's character is rather flat. But this is forgiven by the fact we get some great character development with Furiosa and Nux.

Also the high octane fight scene that consumes majority of the film, despite being very well shot, does tend to make one start to feel like zoning out. But to be honest I think that's just a me thing."
No Name,1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It has nothing to do with Mad Max and has zero story line.  I think the screenwriters dropped acid before they wrote this pathetic script.
No Name,4,"A fun and surprisingly exciting narrative that has only a few minor flaws, particularly with its scope and sometimes less-explained side characters. Fury Road made a real impact, probably much greater than the original Mad Max, but even for its impact, there are definite points near the end where you'll start to ask to get off the ride."
No Name,5,"Mad Max: Fury Road is basically a 2-hour long action scene. This movie barely ever stops, the plot is always advancing forward. All the action scenes are insane, unique and exciting. The story itself is also interesting and I found myself rooting for the protagonists. And I really liked how all the characters very useful and were helping each other. The ""damsel in distress"" trope has been subversed excellently."
No Name,5,"Visually cripping, an absolute orgy of color and action.  And a clinic in world building and storytelling through action"
No Name,2,"Struggled to tell a compelling story. Seems like kind of a half hearted excuse to try a Mad Max installment with more current, cutting edge special effects."
No Name,5,Best action movie of all time. Imagine that movie behind Black Phanter. Americans please do not watch a  movie again. Just leave us alone.
No Name,3.5,Straight up action movie if there ever was one. For a bit of the movie I was distracted by how this connects to the other movies but then I just didn't care. Didn't really pay attention to the plot except to understand what was going on. Stunts and visuals were the best I've seen in awhile especially if most were actually practical and not CG. Very entertaining. I would rent it for $3 once/yr to watch it.
No Name,0.5,"I have never been this disappointed in a film for which I had expected so little. This film ham-handedly delivers half-baked social and political commentary where the main character speaks all of about five words and the action seems like it was composed by a puberty-crazed twelve year old boy on cocaine, copious amounts of cocaine. I found myself somewhere between indignant anger and hysterical laughter as I watched this train wreck of a movie that people were lauding as an artistic masterpiece. I am afraid that watching this film may have more adverse effects on cognitive development than a year drinking Flint, Michigan tap water."
No Name,4.5,a revolution in sci-fi movies
No Name,5,"This movie is a work of art. Every frame, every shot, every action scene it's a freaking work of art. This should be presented in art schools on how to make action movies. The editing is flawless"
No Name,5,"""I LIVE, I DIE, I LIVE AGAIN...!''

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) directed by George Miller is a post-apocalyptic science-fiction masterpiece. A truly amazing cinematic achievement.

It feels like George Miller has been studying for this piece of art since the release of ''Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome''(1985) and finally mastered how to make the perfect Mad Max movie.

A modern epic that is completely flawless from the technical standpoint. A movie to watch in the cinema. A dazzling cinematography with some of the most beautifully crafted shots in cinema history. A score that is extremely effective and drags you down to the Fury Road. An editing that is sent from above and that made this picture have some of the best action sequences of all time.

A fantastic screenplay that shows how passionate Miller is about this apocalyptic world. A very effective and emotional way of telling an epic story.

Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best movies of the 21st century and takes part in the list of my favorite action movies of all time.

''I'M GONNA DIE, I'M GONNA DIE HISTORIC ON FURY ROAD!''"
No Name,5,A classic that will be handed down to generations!
No Name,5,"An epic wonderfully acted, action packed masterpiece with some of the best most intense scenes and music I have ever seen! Loved every minute!!!"
No Name,5,filmasso recomendo mad max estrada da furia é meu 6 filme preferido
No Name,3.5,Rigtig god film til punktet hvor det bliver umuligt at forstille sig en mad-max-stil film der topper den.
No Name,4.5,"Singlehandedly reinvents the action movie as an art form. It's really, really good."
No Name,4,"Com tantos Oscars me sinto culpada por não ter gostado do filme, talvez num futuro reassista…  Em 02 de Outubro de 2019 | NOTA: 6.5, revendo por engano e completamente encantada, não só pelo efeito, como pelo roteiro, um futuro distópico bizarro, grotesco e hediondo, até alterei a nota… Fantástico..."
No Name,5,"Smells like: engine, gasoline and heat, the best action movie of all time."
No Name,5,"One of my absolute favorite action movies. The cinematography was on another level and the fact that most of the movie was practical effects blows my mind. The fact that they took a franchise that was always about ""the macho man"" and bringing the story of the brides and Furiosa into the mix was brilliant."
No Name,5,Truly a cinematic experience.
No Name,5,Best movie I've ever seen in my life
No Name,3.5,Worth a watch for the gonzo practical action even though the plot is pretty much non-existent.
No Name,4,"I’m not sure if it’s the greatest action movie ever, but it’s certainly in the conversation"
No Name,5,"Quite possibly the greatest action film of all time, Fury Road sprints into action and never stops. Everyone and everything performing at their absolute peak. From the impeccable cast to the larger than life set pieces to the jawdropping practical effects, Fury Road is decidedly opposed to the idea of wasting anyone's time. An indisputed masterpiece, this is the playbook by which other films will be made and the new standard by which other films will be judged."
No Name,5,"I absolutely loved this film! a must see. i went by in a flash. Great great film. And the acting, OMG! and the editing was great, and the cinematography. He is a really good director!"
No Name,3.5,"The Road Warrior is one of the most iconic films of the 20th Century.  Making a subsequent film, without Mel Gibson, 40+ years later was a gamble for George Miller. It is not The Road Warrior but it is good.  Tom Hardy is good as Max, but, oddly a second player to Charlize Theron's lead character. She is bold and good as the female leader rescuing the wives of the central cult like villain.  She is clearly the 21st Century, female embodiment of the original Max-this is evidenced by her early mimic of The Road Warrior dialogue.  Much of this post apocalyptic wasteland is familiar and brutal.   The madness, violence, scarcity, and perversity are all out of Miller's universe. The cinematography is spotty at times, and too frenetic for my taste.  The vehicular chases and related effects are stunning.  The theme of female empowerment is great.  Worth the roller coaster ride."
No Name,4.5,"Stylistic, action-packed and over the top, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is awesome. (And the soundtrack is so, so good!)"
No Name,5,"Freaking outstanding! Mad Max Fury Road is up there with Terminator 2 and the Matrix as some of the best action movies ever made for so many reasons. First of all, this is one of the most visually stunning movies ever made. They somehow managed to make a desert incredibly appealing and the whole movie is filled with so many beautiful colors and jaw dropping cinematography. It's a work of art! The combined use of practical effects and CGI worked wonder and the action is *chef kiss*. It's a non stop thrill ride that's super intense, makes you feel tension for the characters, filled with incredible stunt work and exceptional editing that makes the action feel real, alive, like you're there and that's another perfect thing about this movie. It feels lioe you're in a post apocalyptic world with the lack of nature, women being used as sex objects and normal humand trying to survive with cult groups and it's subtle with it. It shows us the world, making for some incredible visual storytelling (A+)"
No Name,3,"Not as good as the original. Great production, but the story has little point. Just a movie to pass the time as far as I'm concerned."
No Name,4,"Like Mad Max 2, in it's time, Fury Road brings back, in a huge way, the post apocalypse world like we've never seen before. Every character, dialogue, and scene is masterfully done! The actors where spot on and the best part? No zombies🤣"
No Name,5,Brilliant. A must watch.
No Name,5,"Five stars, naturally. Even with multiple viewings, Mad Max never ceases to entertain and amaze. Great cinematography, direction, acting, action, world-building, writing, EVERYTHING. Who knew a 2 hour car chase through the desert could be such a bananas-engaging story."
No Name,4.5,"The stunts, choreography, effects, set design, and costume design more than make up for the minimal story here. Charlize Theron is excellent and Tom Hardy is fine (not that he had a lot to work with). It takes its simple premise and executes it nearly flawlessly and I love all of the female empowerment throughout. Like, yeah, I'm completely sold that a dozen badass women are gonna come destroy capitalism and save the world. I'm all for it; let's go already.
This movie is like watching Olympic gymnasts try to murder each other, which is basically exactly what it is. It's extremely action-heavy, but all of the choreography is so unique and well-done that it's incredibly engaging. The battles between characters are ridiculous and impractical, but the movie makes the world feel alien enough that it doesn't stand out as distracting, just as freaking awesome. The violence is brutal but oh-so-satisfying. The set pieces are all really impressive and each location feels different, despite having a fairly consistent desert backdrop.
It has a few cliches, like how the main characters refuse to die despite having concussions and broken bones that could have killed them dozens of times over. Injuries also seem to heal themselves in a matter of minutes, allowing our heroes to continue the fight when they should be immobilized at best. This takes away some of the gritty realism (which sounds ridiculous for this movie, I know) and ultimately hampers a bit of the experience. Also, as much as I appreciate the practical effects and lack of CGI, the occasional moments of CGI feel very out of place.
That being said, I still love this movie and the visuals will never fail to amaze me. I've never even seen any of the original Mad Max films, but I just might have to go back and check them out."
No Name,5,A visually stunning post-apocalyptic masterpiece and one of the greatest action films of all time.
No Name,5,How did they make this movie it's just awesome.
No Name,3.5,"It drives up a dead-end road and U-turns back again, but it looks pretty cool."
No Name,4,Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are badass in the movie
No Name,5,awesome movie with great special effects good storyline amazing actors and insane action. It also has good antagonists with two side ones and one main antagonist
No Name,5,"With a good soundtrack, incredible scenery and a rounded script, Mad Max manages to get everything he proposes right and still contains good performances. (10/10)"
No Name,3.5,"So much fun, lots of action. Just waiting for that sequel"
No Name,3,"nice choreographies, images and sound, I guess that's all"
No Name,5,"The music, the action, the character...everything about this movie is a masterpiece."
No Name,5,one of my all time favorites
No Name,5,"This cinematic masterpiece really defied the laws of what makes a movie good. With a fairly basic plot and not a complicated storyline, it left room for some incredible movie sequences with amazing car chases and action - the cinematic experience of all the incredible colors and action was amazing. This will probably leave you dazed after you watch it, some of the scenes are so mind-blowing."
No Name,5,"O filme é simplesmente perfeito, o personagens são maravilhosos a história é incrível e as cenas de ação com efeitos práticos nosssaaaaaa, é um filme simplesmente perfeito, incrível e sensacional super recomendo"
No Name,5,This tried to kickstart a genre but unfortunately failed. That being said it's one of my favorite movies of all time.
No Name,4.5,"The best of the franchise, of cos 20 years apart with filmmaking technology advancement & much nicer hot-wheels haha... Rev. head & War Boy nice, pure 2-hours of full throttle adrenaline death wish with such  top-rated superstars line-up, so much expectations & it didn't disappointed a bit. Miss-firing shotgun still appears after all this time wahahaha... Max oh Max"
No Name,0.5,"I am having a hard time understanding the ratings for this movie - I found it difficult to even finish watching. It was just monotonous action, zero character exposition, and pretty terrible acting by Tom Hardy, who I normally like."
No Name,4.5,A post apocalyptic movie reboot done right. Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy were excellent in their works.
No Name,4.5,"While obviously heavily inspired by Mad Max 2, a previous entry in the series, it stands well as its own stand alone story. It has considerable better action and a better script than any of the previous movies in the franchise and is with out a doubt one of the greatest action movies ever made. Unlike any of the previous Mad Max films this one also has a black and white which makes this film even more unique and in many ways it improves the overall experience."
No Name,3,Its a Full Pop Corn Action/Adventure Entertainer
No Name,5,Death to the patriarchy.
No Name,3,"62/100. First things first, this movie is very metal and very steampunk so if you're not into that, you're not going to like this movie. The main thing I didn't like about ‘Fury Road' is that there are parts that are weird and uncomfortable just for the sake of being weird and uncomfortable. The people in this movie are so detached from humanity yet the movie never explained how humans wavered so far in the first place. Also, this movie is predictable especially the third act. This film has an interesting premise and does a good job world building but most of the movie is just car chase after car chase after car chase. When the actors and actresses are able to do their thing, that is when this movie is at its best even though we don't get much of it. As an action movie, it does what action movies are supposed to do in terms of action sequences, but it was not my cup of tea and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this way."
No Name,2,"Horrible movie by itself.  Worse movie when you compared to the original Mel Gibson trilogy.  The movie is simply a big-budget amalgam of the originals.
Breeders = Gasoline from the Road Warrior & Master from Thunderdome
Immortan Joe = Aunty Entity + The Humungus
Nux = The Feral Kid + Jedediah
Motorcycle Gang = Toe-Cutter + Goose 
The only surprise is that Imperator Furiosa so did not die like Jessie & Warrior Woman.
The storyline is canned.  The plot is ridiculous.  The non-sequiturs are innumerous.  Too bad Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy signed up for this version of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
No Name,5,Such gorgeous chaos!
No Name,5,Powerful. Vicious. Restless.
No Name,3.5,"It's just pure eye-candy and sound experience. So in terms of testing your home cinema system, great. Very entertaining popcorn flick. But the story? Men ... very uninspiring and that really hurts the otherwise excellent movie."
No Name,5,"Simplesmente perfeito, um filme sem o mínimo erro, boas atuações, cenas de ação absurdas, e uma direção sublime, um filmão"
No Name,5,i don't usually like gory action movies but the stunning visuals and emotional depth of mad max: fury road have earned it a permanent spot on my list of favorite movies
No Name,5,Best action movie of all time
No Name,4.5,"Witness me...

It's been awhile since I watched this movie, and since it's on HBO Max, I wanted to relive it.

And I loved this movie. One of the most fun, entertaining, and spectacular action movies that I have ever watched. I was in awe at how they were able to film these long sequences of car chase in the desert. 

The first half was unrelenting. Two major action sequences made for an intense and fast-moving experience. The editing that focused on the face of the characters created the sense of intensity and craziness. The second half was pretty much the same thing and I was still amazed at the incredible work put into these sequences. 

My only problem was that at the middle, the movie slowed down, which was fine initially. However, I felt it took a bit too long. I honestly didn't care much for the characters, and just wanted the action. Therefore, the emotion wasn't too much there. 

Overall, one of the best and relentless action movies that entertaining me from the start to finish. It was quite a fury road indeed. 9/10"
No Name,0.5,Absolutely terrible. What could you possibly like about this movie?
No Name,3.5,"It's a good movie. Hell, it's a great movie-

But it isn't Mad Max. Mad Max went mad because of his wife and son's slaughter in the Australian Outback- this one is just crazy. It's wearing a mask it does not need and simply took the name so it could get traction. Demeaning, but ok. 

It makes me a bit sad that this wasn't a pick-up of the Trilogy, but simply a reboot. This Max has no past to me, no reasoning. I could replace him with anyone and not feel different. 

That being said, it's a great dystopian film. There are so many good parts and so many interesting implications. I do recommend it."
No Name,2,"Sure, Fury Road is boldly beautiful, adds a nice feminine angle to the storyline and includes all the post-apocalyptic trademarks that I expected as an OG fan of the original trilogy. But I can't help thinking for a film that was supposed to take the action genre to even greater heights, it really never strayed far from the standard action fare. I'll take a simple story and interesting characters over stunning visuals every time."
No Name,4.5,Breathtaking scenery and action sequences. One of the most flawless action films created with cinematography that emerges its viewer into the films dystopian landscape.
Jorge O,5,if you get a chance to watch this masterpiece in the movie theater do it. One of the greatest action movies ever made.
No Name,0.5,"Awful movie. Unless you're the type of person who likes cheesy CGI, bad acting and hackneyed storyline. Oh wait, they have a really long desert car chase scene with fake CGI explosions. Cool. Watch the original instead."
No Name,3,the movie was ok.. bad CGI sometimes. The end sucked in my opinion. I like the fast paced scenes.
David Benjamin Judah,5,The best action movie ever made!!!!!
No Name,5,An action masterpiece. Unique designs and ideas.
No Name,5,"RATING: A+  Director: George Miller 
Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those films were you literally can't look away, cause there just is to much in every frame that you could miss. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lead the Ensemble Cast and the two of them have an amazing chemistry. I gotta say that Nicholas Hoult delivered an breakthrough performance. The Screenplay is great ( unlike in many other blockbusters ) and Miller's Direction is even better. There definitely has to be props to the stunt team too cause what they did is nothing but brilliant. The sound, costumes, Production Design and Editing were really great too. But I think the 6 Academy Awards speak for themselves."
No Name,1,"This was so tedious, I've tried to watch it twice. I just can't get through it."
No Name,5,Amazing movie. The production is very well done and the acting is superb.
No Name,4,A little slow at first but holy cow were the fight scenes intense!  The visuals as well as the mixing was stunning!  You don't really need to know much of what the franchise was about to enjoy this movie!
No Name,5,"mayor, the film is action from start to finish without losing a beat in no time, the script is great, the photography is stunning, the direction is perfect and the performances are to be admired, Mad Max Estrada from fury is a practically perfect film ."
No Name,4.5,"It may take someone with modern film taste to appreciate, but after a few revisits and reflection, you'll realize that the feminism, visuals, thrills, and story deserve at the praise it gets."
No Name,3.5,Watch it in black and white it'll blow you away!
No Name,4,"Really pleasantly surprised at this movie. The supporting cast really saves this movie because other than Max looking and pulling off some christopher lambart looks and body language, his character development was rather weak compared to the others. Thats ok though because you are a mad max fan that knows this mans story inside out. Otherwise, its the wheel for you.... you know the rule.  Bust a deal. Face the wheel.

WITNESS MEEEEE!"
No Name,5,Great action settled in a dystopian world you must love and fear for its madness.
No Name,4.5,"Glorious spectacle, far greater than anything that came before it in the Mad Max series."
No Name,5,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER IN HISTORY AND FUTER MADE!
MAD MAX FURY ROAD IS FCK MASTERPIECE!"
No Name,5,"Max Mad Fury Road is brilliant! The way it recreates and updates the post apocalyptic world from the original films is spectacular. And it's new story and characters make it stand out in ways the original(s) did not. The camera shots are thoughtful and unique. The colors are bright and genuine to life and along with the non-stop action, pull the viewer in making you feel like you're right there with the characters on screen. Even if you're not a fan of action movies the sheer artistry of Max Max Fury Road will demand your full attention (and make your jaw drop). All reboots should be this great.  Keep your fingers crossed for a sequel because you will want to see more (*and hopefully it will have the same actors because recasting the actors destroys a film's contiunity and it's character's integrity and appeal)."
No Name,5,"It is the word ""ACTION"" translated into film language. The truly good history behind the raw universe of George Miller. 10/10"
No Name,5,Truly a masterpiece.
No Name,4.5,"A true accomplishment of unforgettable cinematic action experience, a simple story glows and becomes one to follow. Among the barren, dusty and helpless world we’re thrown into comes something substantial. And once you dust yourself off, only a big grasp of air will return you back from the edge of your seat"
No Name,2.5,I found it mildly interesting but by the end I was bored.
No Name,5,"I have seen this movie many times, it is a very interesting movie
https://ariaimen.com/video-door-phone/irani/peyk-video-opener"
No Name,4.5,This movie is great! One of the best action movies!
No Name,5,This films is great! It's one of the best action films I've ever seen. The film is an absolute blast and it's just genuinely fantastic
No Name,4.5,"This is an action packed thrill ride, full of explosions and tense moments. You can really tell the use of practical effects in comparison to visual ones, it also had a killer soundtrack. Everytime I watch this movie I enjoy it, it has amazing rewatchabilty."
No Name,4,The movie is ok but Tom Hardy's performance is kinda shitty.
No Name,5,"La mejor película de la historia de acción jamas hecha, cada paisaje es alucinante, cada escena es impactante, cada personaje es formidable en esta descomunal ola de destrucción que no da descanso a la adrenalina y la emoción."
No Name,5,Awesome. Worth a rewatch. 3rd watch 2/13/21
No Name,2,"Don't get mad but I thought this movie kinda sucked. Yes, the action was pretty great and the reasons behind some of the character's decisions are actually really well thought out and believable. But besides that, the rest of the movie sucked. There was no drama, the acting was pretty bad (except Nicholas Hoult), the way the characters were sped up was both cringey and unsatisfying and the movie had like ZERO levity. Like, can't someone spit out a joke for once? Literally everyone is serious AF and it's a f'n Mad Max movie! Anyways, this movie felt bland in literally everything except the action. And it's cool if you like this movie just for the action, but it just isn't my cup of tea."
No Name,5,"This film still hits well after all these years. Whether your watching it in color on a date at a theatre or ""Black & Chrome"" at home , the cinematography , the pace, the cuts, the story, the explosions, the sex and zest - are all to die for. This is what Hollywood movies are made of and for.
 If you can get your hands on it, see the Black & Chrome silent cut - not available through streaming (I learned the hard way). I caught an abridged version on YouTube instead, as I decided to retread down Fury Road, far away from my 1st viewing at the Magic Johnson theater, and still loved every second of my experience.

No Name,3.5,"This is a solid action movie with some well done special effects and a few very beautiful landscape shots that really help create the dystopian world the movie is set in. The casting was great and what emotion there was, felt genuine. My biggest issue with this movie was there is no explanation of back story. I went into this movie having not seen any previous Mad Max movies and the movie plays out as if the audience is already well aware of Max's backstory (including a sub plot with a hallucination of a girl which I still don't get). Since the last movie in the series came out in 1985, I was hoping that backstory would be re-established (seriously, a 5-10 minute flash back at the beginning of the movie would've been awesome). Instead you are dropped into the movie and it took 20 minutes before I was really hooked. I feel that one piece alone would've helped my movie experience incredibly. All that aside, it's was still a great movie and I look forward to the next installment. I will probably go back and watch the old ones as well. If you are planning on watching this movie it is very well worth it but I suggest you try to get the backstory first."
No Name,3,"A theatre circus act of a movie, overly numerous and stretched poignancies, implausablability, chartoonish characters, neverending chase scenes, debauched nuances and unbelievable premises mean this is a film that is a spectacle of how spectacular you can make something, not a film with a story."
No Name,4.5,"Great ""antihero"" movie"
No Name,5,"This is a classic, it pays respect to the main character, the scenes are beautiful and flow well, the film keeps you watching and there's never a dull moment. This is how you do a female lead, she is strong but not flawless and does not win every fight. She is the opposite of a Mary sue which is how it should be done."
No Name,5,A classic story about overthrowing old and overreaching power in a beautiful dystopian world. Highly recommended.
No Name,5,Es la mejor pelicula que he visto. No hay palabras para describir la experiencia que fue ir al cine a sumergirme en la acción desenfrenada y el trasfondo social que te lanzan a la cara.
No Name,2,"Underneath the exaggerated punk fabrications and childish stunts a banal story tries to make it over the line. I drifted in and drifted out much like I do spending 2 hours on our ride on mower doing the back paddock. Might have worked better as an exhibition of stills photos. But I  was encouraged by reviews that hurled, 'epic', 'post-apocalyptic', 'cinematic art', 'visceral'... I would gladly have done with less of those, for something interesting and emotional engaging characters. That said, heroes and heroines were very attractive and villains not. Diesel panto."
No Name,5,Probably the greatest action movie of all time.
No Name,4.5,Visually stunning. I wish it had a little more plot and Backstory on some of the characters. Otherwise mesmerizing.
No Name,5,"Fury Road might be the best post-apocalyptic action film ever made! You don’t get a break for at least an hour, and it’s not enough of one to catch your breath. It’s packed with style, relentlessly bleak, brutal, and high-octane with sparse and bizarre dialog like the original Mad Max, but I think the story concept is more interesting. Excellent costumes, score and sound design, stunts, characters, direction, acting, editing, props, vehicles, cinematography, and scenery. I think I’ve watched it at least once every year since it came out, and I can’t think of anything that would make it better. I wish I had seen it in a theater!"
No Name,5,Fury Road is one of the best action movies ever made. Masterpiece
No Name,4,"I thought it was a masterpiece. Epic fight/battle scenes especially the opening chase, brilliant cinematography"
No Name,4,"0.17 laughs/min. 

25.7% of movie spent tense. 

A high octane thrill ride set in a dystopian future ravaged by climate change and patriarchy."
No Name,4,Pure action must see
No Name,5,Best action movie of all time. Period.
No Name,4,Those epic scenarios took a terrific cinematography that has also a nice story to tell with amazing action scenes and soundtracks.
No Name,0.5,"love the original mad max but I don't understand why people like this. I know there is nuance story to it and I don't doubt that at all. but the action I cannot understand why people praise it so much. Max does barley any fighting at all compared to the original 3 and the only action that is in it is people chucking explosive spears at cars. THATS IT! maybe 1 scene with Max using his shotgun or Furiosa using a pistol or something. Basically the film is drive to point A, get spears chucked at them, reach point B, realise they got to go back to point A, drives back to point A, gets hit by more spears, reaches point A again, frees people. there ya go thats the film. 

And I love the actors and actresses in this film but Max isn't Max anymore. He just grunts and nods and has zero character. Fanboys will say he doesn't say much in the originals but if you watch them again you will see not only are you wrong but there is so much story to him in the originals that even his grunts or nods mean a lot more in those films then the words Max finally gets to utter in this film. Tom Hardy could be a great successor to Mel Gibson but the writing of the character ruined it. No longer is he the angry but smart and kind of charismatic loner from the first film, now he is just a moody guy that just does things."
No Name,4,"Pretty cool, it felt the classic Mad Max feel, the action was good, the costumes were really good. But it's not a masterpiece, just an awesome movie."
No Name,5,Tom Hardy is an absolute tank. This movie is non-stop action and keeps everyone in suspense. It is an absolute must-see for everyone over 14.
No Name,4.5,"We were due for another better Mad Max film, and we sure got it."
No Name,5,One of the best action movies of all time.
No Name,4.5,The first parts of it were a little disinteresting to me but overall it was cool! Lot's of fantastic parts once it really got rolling and I really liked the plot.
No Name,4.5,"This is one of the most out of control action films I've ever seen! It offers a unique vision of the future if it was on a lot of sugar and watched way too many fast and furious movies. It is fun, exciting, and coins the term ""Motor Combat"""
No Name,5,Nothing less than the best action movie I've ever seen.
No Name,5,The best movie I've seen in year's. Everything in this film was done perfectly what more can I say!
No Name,5,I genuinely thought I was going to have a heart attack. I have never been so stressed out. Non-stop action that was never exhausting.
No Name,2,"A lame script and tired action tropes power this stinker.  Two stars cuz its visual style hit its mark perfectly, but the rest is a pretty rough watch."
No Name,3.5,"For all its admirable production design and cinematography, the whole experience ended up being a little underwhelming for me."
No Name,4.5,Cine mezclado con extasis. Vistas 1
No Name,5,"Top 5 action movies of all time, and I think it might be my favorite of all time. Absolutely perfect. Can't explain it; you just gotta watch it."
No Name,2.5,It's a decent movie but it should have been it's own thing. It capitalizes on a known title (poorly) to tell a bare bones story. It's visually interesting & has some cool moments but overall seems like a mismanaged idea.
No Name,5,"This movie is just great, the story doesn't make any sense, but that's also just adds to the fun of watching this movie. It also makes me laugh when I just think of how filming this movie must have been, because (almost) nothing in this movie was made with a computer."
No Name,3.5,"Fun movie, good effects. Charlize Theron is excellent."
No Name,3,"Visually appealing with a good cast and acting, but excessive focus on action over plot.  They certainly accomplish the creation of a dystopian world that is interesting.  The vehicles, the Citadel, and the mechanics of things are impressive.  To me, you just have this set of interesting characters that you don't know really anything about, so you don't fully appreciate their actions and motivations.  You don't get a chance to get emotionally involved because it's a stranger you just met.  I would have preferred the film to be split over 2-3 individual films in more of a Peter Jackson format of developing the characters over time but shot at once."
No Name,3.5,Miller's attempt to not focus on the titular character but to the subsequent feminism theme surprisingly works for the undeniably well-crafted action sequences
No Name,5,"Pros: Fenomenal
Cons: No sequel yet"
No Name,5,"Esse filme é simplesmente maravilhoso, é o filme que vai fazer sua alma sair e voltar do seu corpo de tanta ação que têm em madmax: fury road. Filme magnífico, efeitos especiais perfeitos, atores perfeitos, coreografias perfeitas, efeitos práticos perfeitos e etcs perfeitos."
No Name,5,"potent, technical, stunning, wild, these are some adjectives that describe this feature. Mad Max: Fury Road is a complete chaos orchestrated by human beings in their most ambiguous insanity in a post-apocalyptic world. George Miller created an extremely fascinating, perverse, and brutal work, portraying a world where people are at their emotional, physical, and especially mental limits. The first feature, 1979's Mad Max, came with a somewhat daring proposal, where the focus would be on unbridled action in an Australia where the streets were taken by people and their vehicles in a state of madness, and at the same time that Max (played by Mel Gibson), a police officer respected by his comrades and the city where he works, sees himself with his ideals coming to the fore when he goes through an experience that will shake his life forever.
With the original trilogy finished in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (Mad Max - Beyond the Thunder Dome) in 1985, it was 28 years before the filming of the new feature started, which started in July 2012 in Namibia, and was released in 2015. There was an expectation coming from a director like George Miller, but as images and trailer were being released, it became a work with great potential, and this was realized with its release, only the maximum potential of everything was raised. what was expected.
The experience of experiencing (or rather saying ""witnessing"") this feature in a movie theater, was certainly one of the best things of that year. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best films of 2015, and of the past decade, the biggest and best action film in the history of cinema."
No Name,4.5,"I don't like action movies and I don't like chase scenes, but somehow this movie managed to entertain me from start to finish."
No Name,5,"Best action movie of all time, packed with crazy sequences and spectacular photography. Highly recommended in the Black&Chrome version."
No Name,5,"This was an amazing film. The action in this film is outstanding. Tom Hardy was much better in this movie than he was in ""Venom"". Definitely one of the best action films of the 2010's and one of my favorite films of all time."
No Name,4.5,"Not everyone's cup of tea but if you even remotely like things going boom, brooding stoic characters or some off the chain insanity, this is for you."
No Name,5,Doesn't get any better than this. Gutsy and glorious.
