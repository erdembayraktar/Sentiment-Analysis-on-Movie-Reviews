Name,Rating,Review
No Name,4.5,"**The Two Towers** is pure cinematic magic. Peter Jackson was *born* to helm this trilogy, and this middle chapter cements why. Visually, it‚Äôs a feast‚Äîbreathtaking landscapes, epic battles, and a perfect translation of Tolkien‚Äôs world to the screen. Ian McKellen‚Äôs Gandalf is as legendary as ever, and Sean Astin‚Äôs Sam adds so much heart, loyalty, and charm to the journey. The storytelling is tight, tense, and brimming with iconic moments‚Äîfrom Gollum‚Äôs inner turmoil to Helm‚Äôs Deep, which remains a masterclass in battle sequences. 

Howard Shore‚Äôs soundtrack? Flawless. It pulls you deeper into this world, elevating every scene. The runtime is hefty, sure, and while it‚Äôs not *boring*, it‚Äôs definitely a commitment‚Äîbut one worth every second. This film has aged like fine wine and never fails to surprise me on rewatch. It‚Äôs not just a sequel; it‚Äôs an upgrade. A masterpiece through and through."
No Name,5,Exceptional movie! Part of the best trilogy ever made.
No Name,5,Best film in the series and hard to find anything wrong with it. Possibly the best battle scene in any movie ever.
No Name,5,Absolute perfect combination with passionate Jackson and Tolkiens world. Writing and acting is perfect. CGI IS actually good like it used to be. Jackson Respects Tolkiens works and it shows.
No Name,5,While not being as good as return of the king it's still close to a masterpiece
No Name,4.5,"Tripling its forerunner's dizzying accomplishments while increasing the narrative spectacle and visual heft, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an impressive work of cinematic art that derives much of its greatness from Peter Jackson's passionate writing and direction."
No Name,5,"Arguably the greatest trilogy of all time. Certainly the greatest trilogy of my generation. Brilliant writing, brilliant casting, brilliant acting and brilliant direction. As close to perfection as we can come. Amazing masterpieces."
No Name,5,Perfect absolutely perfect.
No Name,5,"The second of three, this beautiful film has stunning cinematography, especially ially in the battles (helms deep being the most notable.) Sam's speech at the end is so inspiring and gives you a feel of not just what the characters are feeling, but also what J. R. R. Tolkien must of have felt back in WW1. I recommend yhe extend editions, but the theatrical will still be an amazing experience."
No Name,4.5,I love this movie so much!!! It was just a little long and slow at some parts.
No Name,5,"O filme √© √≥timo,o desenvolvimento de personagens √© excelente,com uma fotografia e dire√ß√£o impec√°vel, a fidelidade a obra de Tolkien √© n√≠tida,recomendo a todos"
No Name,5,The second best movie ever made
No Name,5,This is the Empire Strikes Back of Lord of the Rings. Howard Shore is the GOAT . FANTASTIC composer. The battle at Helms Deep is so awesome. The Academy Awards dropped the ball and only giving Two Towers best effects and sound editing? You mean Chicago is the best movie over two Towers ? Get the fuck out. Legolas and Gimli counting kills ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ 10/10 EPIC FANTASTIC.
No Name,5,another masterpiece. the greatest battle scene in cinema.
No Name,5,"It may sound odd to refer to ""the Two Towers"" as underrated, but it is all relatively speaking. For some reason, of the original trilogy, this one gets the least amount of love. As of writing this review it is the lowest ranked on IMDb ( #14 on the top 250, where the other two are in the top 10). It won only 2 Oscars, where the first won 4 and the final won 11. So, I'm not sure whether this is an unpopular opinion or not, but this is my favorite Lord of the Rings movie.

To a certain degree, I can understand why it's comparatively ignored. The first one begins the grand adventure, the third concludes it in grand fashion and the second just continues the story set up in the first. But this one introduces so many of the staples that would come to be synonymous with the series. This is where Andy Serkis as Golem really gets to shine. Characters like Wormtail, TreeBeard, Eowyn and Carl Urban are introduced. The action in this one is the best of the trilogy. The battle for Helm's Deep is thrilling, creative, huge and epic. The battle might go for about 40 minutes of runtime, but it never feels repetitive. You're rooting for these characters to succeed against all odds.

Unlike the first movie, since the fellowship has broken up into smaller groups, the movie is able to cut between each of their side-adventures. There is not a side adventure in the movie that I don't find engaging, they are all interesting to watch. These multiple stories also help with the pacing of the movie. It feels like Peter Jackson was making an extra effort to have the story move at a quicker pace. The movie is a minute longer than the first, but it feels much shorter and easier to watch.

It makes sense, where the first movie takes time to get started and the third takes time to wrap up, the second can spend all its time in the adventure. And what a grand adventure it is. Of all the trilogy this is the one I can rewatch the most. The middle chapter of middle earth is the best of the best."
No Name,4,"Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the cinematography. Too darker than it‚Äôs predecessor. Still, a solid addition to the trilogy"
No Name,4.5,This film is a wonderful second edition to the trilogy. The acting is still top notch. The world created by Jackson is engaging and vast. Some areas seem to drag a bit but are investments for later on in the movie. I recommend the extended edition which added important and fun scenes. This is my least favorite out of the three but that does not say much since they are all masterpieces.
No Name,5,Slightly weaker than Fellowship of the Ring but still a 10/10 film
No Name,5,Great film. Preserving Tolkien's philosophy overall.
No Name,5,Just as good as the first one.
No Name,5,"An excellent adaptation, it is no coincidence that the 3 films received 17 Oscars."
No Name,5,An exquisite film but the name diddnt age well lol üè∞üè∞üõ©Ô∏è
No Name,5,Possibly the greatest portrayal of siege warfare.
No Name,4,"Way better than the fellowship, interesting development of the story and great battle scenes, very very well-done! I need the extended edition asap!"
No Name,5,Watch the extended version.
No Name,5,"A really good movie.
The movie was really epic, adventurous and emotional.
I'm really looking forward for the last movie."
No Name,5,"Unrivaled fantasy epic, second installment of the trilogy"
No Name,4,"The relationship and parallels between Frodo, Sm√©agol, and Sam make the experience of this film heartbreaking for each character as they struggle with the realities of being together while being stewards of the Ring. The performances from Ian McKellen and all the cast are so believable and tender that I really believe they all care for each other deeply."
No Name,5,not as good as the first one its still a great movie
No Name,5,An epic cinematic masterpiece that continues the saga and improves upon everything that already the first so good.
No Name,5,incredible experience watching this for the first time. perfect.
No Name,5,"My personal favourite from this trilogy, simply put ""perfection""!"
No Name,5,A pillar of it's time.
No Name,4.5,"The Two Towers is a great movie. Is it as good as the other two films in the trilogy? I personally don't think so. I found myself less invested in some of the story elements, particularly when they involved the human characters (which occupied much of the runtime). Though not as strong as Fellowship or RoTK, this movie is full of spectacular moments. 

The Battle of Helm's Deep might be the best battle in cinematic history. From the driving force to the action to the gravitas, everything about that sequence is jaw-dropping. Though incredibly dark and serious, the humor is spot-on and adds a needed layer of character development. 

On top of the action, what this movie does well is develop relationships between characters. Frodo and Sam, Legolas and Gimli, Frodo and Sm√©agol, Aragorn and √âowyn, and beyond. The relationships in this film are superb and help push the story forward. 

When I want to watch incredible action and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a great movie in an amazing trilogy. 

Best Character: Gimli
Best Moment: The Battle of Helm's Deep (the entire thing)
Best Quote: ""Toss me."" - Gimli"
No Name,5,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, is an amazing movie that perfectly combines epic battles and emotional moments. The Battle of Helm's Deep is intense and exciting, and the characters, especially Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, have a lot of depth that really makes you care about them. Gollum, played by Andy Serkis, is especially impressive and feels like a real character despite being CGI. The visuals are beautiful, and the music by Howard Shore makes everything even more epic. With its themes of friendship and hope, this movie is a must-watch and definitely deserves five stars."
No Name,5,"ACHO ESSE FILME UM POUCO SUPERIOR AO SEUS ANTECEDENTE , POIS ACHO MENOS ARRASTADO E MAIS RAPIDO , OQUE DEIXA O FILME MAIS AMENO , O FILME PARECE QUE ACABA RAPIDO MAS POSSUI MAIS DE 2 HORAS , SEM PALAVRAS PARA DESCREVER O QUAO BOM ESSE FILME √â."
No Name,4,"Because of the chronology of the story, so much of the book Two Towers has to be moved to ROTK. As such, there's a lot of filler that just seems like padding in the Extended Edition. 

Yet, my last watch of the Theatrical felt like a rushed mess that didn't take any time to let moments be digested.

The technical marvels still on display all these years later hold up. The performances are strong (though the character development is muted).

Helms Deep remains one of the greatest battles; Gollum still scintillates; Bernard Hill gives Theoden a tragic majesty.

One version moving too quickly, another version too padded without significant dedication to character development; The Two Towers still remains an essential watch being part of the greatest examples of filmmaking one will ever see."
No Name,5,"The perfect cast, respects the lore to give us an amazing story and awesome design. Deserves all the praise it gets."
No Name,5,"All three movies are awesome. This one is the weakest of the trilogy but still a 5/5 star rating, thats how good they are."
Matt,5,The extended version adds a lot to the original film.
No Name,1.5,"Despite a rich universe and a few tense moments, the film suffers from a simplistic plot, underdeveloped characters, and uneven pacing, leaving me overall disappointed."
No Name,5,"Bombastische Kampfszenen, unglaubliche Spannung beim Kampf zwischen Gut + B√∂se.
Die Ausstattung + Cinematography sind einzigartig.
Das Erlebnis des Films war besser als meine Fantasie beim lesen des Buchs. Als w√§re man selbst dabei gewesen.
Geniale Filmmusik."
No Name,5,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers""**

*The Two Towers*, the second film in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, stands as my personal favorite, not only within the trilogy but also as a cinematic experience in its own right. The film, directed by Peter Jackson, takes the momentum built by *The Fellowship of the Ring* and propels it to new heights, blending intense action, deep character development, and stunning visual storytelling.

What makes *The Two Towers* remarkable is its seamless juggling of multiple storylines, each as engaging as the other. Frodo and Sam‚Äôs perilous journey toward Mordor, guided by the treacherous yet pitiable Gollum, presents a tense and psychological exploration of the corrupting power of the Ring. Andy Serkis‚Äô performance as Gollum, enhanced by groundbreaking motion capture technology, is nothing short of revolutionary. Gollum‚Äôs internal conflict, brilliantly captured in the ""two personalities"" scene, adds a complex layer to the narrative, deepening the themes of duality and inner struggle.

Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli‚Äôs pursuit of the Uruk-hai who captured Merry and Pippin brings us into the heart of Rohan, where the movie's epic scale truly begins to unfold. The introduction of Rohan‚Äôs people, particularly King Th√©oden (played by Bernard Hill), √âowyn (Miranda Otto), and √âomer (Karl Urban), enriches the political and emotional stakes of the war. Theoden's journey from a king ensnared by despair to a leader reclaiming his courage is one of the most powerful arcs in the film.

Of course, *The Two Towers* is perhaps most famous for the Battle of Helm‚Äôs Deep, a masterclass in large-scale battle sequences. The sense of tension and desperation builds as the seemingly unstoppable forces of Saruman‚Äôs Uruk-hai assault the fortress, culminating in a heroic last stand that feels both intimate and epic. Jackson‚Äôs ability to make every moment of the battle feel personal, whether it‚Äôs Aragorn rallying the troops or Legolas and Gimli‚Äôs friendly competition, makes this sequence an emotional high point.

One of the film‚Äôs strengths is its ability to maintain a balance between spectacle and character. Despite the large-scale action, it never loses sight of the personal struggles of each character. Frodo‚Äôs growing weariness, Sam‚Äôs unshakeable loyalty, and Aragorn‚Äôs inner conflict about his destiny all serve as emotional anchors, making the stakes of the war deeply personal for the audience. 

Howard Shore‚Äôs score once again shines, with new musical motifs that perfectly capture the majesty of Rohan and the ominous presence of Saruman‚Äôs forces. The music elevates the emotional resonance of key scenes, from the sorrowful laments in Edoras to the triumphant arrival of Gandalf and the Riders of Rohan at Helm‚Äôs Deep.

For me, *The Two Towers* excels because it takes the themes introduced in *The Fellowship of the Ring* and intensifies them, exploring the price of heroism, the weight of choices, and the bonds of friendship in a world descending into war. It‚Äôs a film that perfectly balances darkness and hope, showcasing not just the epic scope of Tolkien‚Äôs world, but also the intimate human struggles within it.

Ultimately, *The Two Towers* is a thrilling, emotionally rich experience that stands out as the most engaging and powerful entry in the trilogy. It‚Äôs a film I return to frequently, and each viewing only deepens my admiration for its intricate storytelling, unforgettable characters, and epic vision."
No Name,5,The second entry into the lord of the rings is absolutely amazing. Just like the first movie it has an amazing pace with incredible action sequences and character moments. It is also my personal favorite out of the three
No Name,5,Absolute masterpiece. An art that will last forever in history.
No Name,5,The Battle of Helm‚Äôs Deep is breathtaking
No Name,5,Masterpiece! Greatest film ever!

No Name,5,I am very grateful for an overall excellent portrayal of one of the greatest works of fiction of all time. Thank you for being true to the values and characters of Tolkien. So well done.
No Name,5,Peter Jackson killed it. Nothing bad to say about this film at all.
No Name,5,Sooooooooo goooooooood
No Name,5,Not much needs to be said about this one. A masterclass in filmmaking. People throw around the word ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù an awful lot lately and I can‚Äôt help refer them to this trilogy to ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù their memories on what a masterpiece actually looks like.
No Name,5,Classics! Absolute must watch!
No Name,5,A brilliant second film in the trilogy. All the outstanding ratings are well deserved. Incredibly executed.

No Name,4.5,The darkest part of the trilogy. Still a sweeping epic.
No Name,5,My favourite movie trilogy of all time. It is astonishing that these movies still hold up after 20 years. You can clearly see the respect for the source material and the passion to make the best adaptation possible.
No Name,5,Truly perfect cinema.
No Name,5,"Unsung hero of the trilogy. Yeah, a couple of things didn‚Äôt religiously follow Tolkien - Elves at Helm‚Äôs Deep, for example - but the way things were implemented was just beautiful."
No Name,5,"Peter Jackson & crew have done an extremely good thing for humans by bringing this novel from Tolkien to life, you don't even notice its a long movie because its just so well made"
kj,4,amazing experience and 4dx was worth it for the camaraderie and fresh experience even if it‚Äôs a tad bit overtuned.
Paul,5,So dope! I hope they re-release it again
Isengard Hobbit Review,5,"The haptic feedback was awesome and at certain points it felt like I was on a roller coaster, the movie was fantastic, just wish the environmental effects were more pronounced (smells and water effects)"
No Name,5,a must see for fans of the jrr tolkien books. the two towers follows those plot lines faithfully
No Name,5,"As the story continues, you only get more hooked. An incredible sequel."
No Name,5,Another banger from one of the best trilogies in the world
Raphael,5,"Brought my Fianc√© to watch it the first time ever. although she was really skeptical about the trilogy, she was really impressed by how, despite the movies being more than 20 years old, the effects and cinematography are still amazing. She now understands why these movies received many Oscars. Now, she is also a fan of these movies."
No Name,5,Absolutamente magistral
Alec,5,"Love the characters, how they flesh them out, world building, the story, and the scenery."
Sadegh,1.5,Movie was great but the seats in this theater are awful. Never again I would return here

No Name,5,"Gripping, atmospheric, and thrilling."
No Name,5,S√≥ sendo louco para n√£o dar 5 estrelas
No Name,5,"Still one of the best things to happen to cinema, so beautiful and it doesn‚Äôt ever feel lost even in the middle of the trilogy. Amazing character moments too."
No Name,5,Back when movies focused more on the plot and the characters
No Name,4.5,A fantastic continuation of the books and first film.
No Name,5,My favorite of the trilogy. But they're all perfect.
No Name,5,I have only one word for it and that is perfect.
No Name,5,"Absolutely the best of the trilogy, it narrowly beats ""The Return of the King"""
No Name,5,Flawlessly perfect.
No Name,4,My fav of the three movies. I liked the books as a kid but found these adaptations to be a little long in movie form. Of the three this one is my favorite from the main trilogy.
Charley,5,"As always, amazing. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Deanna C,5,Fantastic movie!    Seeing it on the big screen in 4K was special.
No Name,5,"Flawless, all of these are flawless. Beautiful work of art with a powerful story and the coolest battle scenes ever."
S. Sabas,5,To see this masterpiece again on the silver screen word cannot describe it now on the next film!
Thomas M,5,Great movie reminds me to hold on in dark times.
Cyndi,5,saw footage I have never seen before...love LOTR...All of it!   Seen 100 times before but not on the big screen...THANKS!!!!‚ù§üëèüëç
Paige,5,Soooo good to see in theaters- felt totally different than watching at home!
Sol,5,"This movie along with Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King are theatrical masterpieces that I never thought I‚Äôd be able to watch on the big screen and it‚Äôs just as beautiful and glorious as I thought, I loved every second of it."
Arik T. B,5,Re-released classic blockbusters always rock
No Name,4.5,"The continuation of Peter Jackson's masterpiece, building it's already strong cast, adding new dimensions to Middle Earth."
No Name,3.5,This movie is a bit better than the first one. Gandalf returning caught me by surprise. One thing that I think could‚Äôve been better was giving Frodo and Gandalf much more screen-time than a few minutes. The visual effects still impress and Gollum cracks me up every scene he‚Äôs in. Another solid Lord of the Rings entry.
No Name,5,"Helm's deep battle is one of the best battles, the direction is still going, Samwise's speech became one of my favourite speeches of the whole movie"
No Name,4,This movie focuses too much on the relationship between Arwen and Aragorn but is still amazing.
No Name,4,The weakest in the trilogy but still so much fun!! They don't waste a SECOND! I love the new areas that FOTR didn't mention or show! The climax of the movie was gold! I mean come on! Alive trees taking down a dam to wash out the orcs were cool!
No Name,5,"Second greatest movie of all time, behind its sequel, adding more characters and continuing the story seems like it could still be hard, but the story continues to get better."
No Name,5,the greatest sequel ever made. simply perfect. any criticisms I've heard is simply not legit it's just some people need stuff to say.
No Name,5,"the best of the 3 film, incredible, beautifull, cool, interesting, everything is good except the umbar showed like ugly savage..."
No Name,5,One of the greatest movies ever made!
No Name,5,"SPOILER WARNING
This movie is incredible and my personal favorite movie of all time (tied with the other two in the trilogy). There is so much to love in this movie so I summed it all up with this one scene. 

Remember the great stories, Mr. Frodo
This scene fills me with motivation even in the darkest of times. After Frodo is corrupted by the ring and is mentally forced to kill Samwise on the dark outskirts of Mordor, Frodo has lost all hope and doubts whether he should keep going or not. However, Samwise reminds him of the great stories, when heroes kept going even when times were tough and all looked lost. As Samwise's speech echoes onto the renowned battle of Helm's Deep and the flooding of Isengard, Frodo starts to realize that, even if it is but a tiny sliver, there is hope.

What makes this scene so emotional is that this happens to almost everyone. There will be a point in your life when you feel like nothing is left, and this scene is a beautiful reminder of why there is always a future no matter the circumstances. You are capable of so much and any human can push through anything, it just takes true will to do so.

This scene concludes the movie in spectacular fashion as things look bright for the battle of Helm's Deep and our heroes go on to continue their journey. My eyes fill with tears every time I hear Samwise the Brave talking over Howard Shore's beautiful score. This scene also portrays true brotherhood and that you can lift anyone (including yourself) up just with some positive thinking.

In conclusion, this film is a breathtaking masterpiece that serves as an amazing build up to the grand finale. I feel like every individual scene had heart and soul put into it and has a valid reason for why it's there. This movie also has deeper themes of brotherhood, perseverance and addiction. I highly recommend viewing this incredible trilogy as it represents what makes us human and what we are capable of."
No Name,5,"My favorite of all 3 installments of the trilogy. The Two Towers will take you into a roller coaster of emotions. It is exciting, funny and emotional. The battle scenes are out of this world. The epic entrances of heroes are the best I have ever seen in any movie ever. It has everything: from funny moments to screams of excitement and boo-hoo crying your eyes out. 

The Two Towers mostly concentrates on Rohan and Saruman, while Frodo and Sam embark on their own journey. It is fascinating to see the film develop and how the stories (like the fellowship) are supporting one another, even unknowingly.

There is just a level of perfection to this movie that it is impossible to surpass. Peter Jackson set a standard that is just unfair to measure other directors."
No Name,4.5,"While not surpassing the previous film, it does manage to surpass 99% of other movies. It continues with the high level of quality of the first film. All around a great film and sequel."
No Name,5,"This is my favorite movie of all time and IMO, a nearly perfect film"
No Name,4,"Although it can't help but feel like the prelude it is, ""The Two Towers"" nevertheless offers fun action, great story arcs and CGI as fantastic as it's told to be."
No Name,5,"Entertaining from start to finish, with epic battle/fight scenes."
No Name,4,"This movie, is even more exciting than the first. Once again, Peter Jackson delivers an exciting interpretation of Tolkien's world. This is a film that I would certainly recommend."
No Name,4,"Could you imagine acting in a lengthy fantasy movie where all your character did was hang out with a group of animated trees for the entire time? Or would your role in the whole film be known most for literally kicking the bucket? Anyway, <i>The Two Towers</i> is a fun movie for fans of the fantasy genre. Almost halfway through watching the extended edition of the film, I started running the math to conclude the trilogy could have been a twelve or thirteen-episode season for some random streaming service if it was produced now instead of over twenty years ago. Also, I completely forgot Brad Dourif is in this movie."
No Name,5,"Perfect, all three are my favourite films of all time"
goose,5,THEY MADE A SECOND ONE?!
No Name,5,"No Tom Bombadil. No Valar. None of that is a problem for me.

As fantastical as Middle-Earth is at times, it still seems like a real place facing very real problems. One of the biggest issues with mapping out your world and its deities so much is that it can make everything else seem inconsequential or impossible to understand without saying ""Well‚Ä¶ I guess the gods work in mysterious ways.""

If you need an example of this, just see the recent MCU: everything is on such a massive, scale-tipping level that it makes what happens with the street-level characters seem pretty unimportant.

That is one flaw of the ‚ÄòLord of the Rings' books not shared by the movies. Not knowing that Melkor's defeat was the *real* threat to the planet while his fractionally-as-powerful minion Sauron's was just a kid trying to recreate his parent's business and failing does wonders for the gravity of the consequences.

Movies > books."
No Name,5,My favorite movie in the series and a 10/10 film. I was very excited to see this for the first time and when I finally did it surpasses my expectations.
No Name,0.5,it was no terror of tiny town thats for sure
No Name,5,A great middle chapter. The two towers features the introduction of Gollum and builds upon the world of the first film.
No Name,5,"The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is one of my favorite films.
The CGI on Gollum is great and all the characters are great.
The best part in the movie is the battle of helm's deep.
Its a masterpiece and I highly recommend this movie."
No Name,5,"Speechless after this film. After the fellowship brought us in hard, this movie delivers a powerful punch. This is the climax of the trilogy, and it flows so well. Just brilliant. You will be wanting more and more."
No Name,5,"Una obra maestra. Viendo esta pel√≠cula uno se da cuenta como se puede hacer buen cine de fantas√≠a con cari√±o y respetando la obra original, a√∫n con algunos cambios. Imprescindible"
No Name,5,This movie was truly spectacular. It has awesome action and suspense. It is one of the best action and adventure films of all time.
No Name,5,"Just finished watching this masterpiece again, such an awesome bunch of films"
No Name,4.5,"What a great sequel that's all I can say that this is definitely a sequel. This is definitely a movie that you have to watch the first one to know what's going on in the second one and I think the book was like that too so throughout the movie, the first act started out with a clear mission from the first movie to get to Modor, Also, there's another plot line with aragorn and the rest of his friends that might play out in the third movie as well but the main thing that I really like about this movie is the third act usually third acts begin with a little slow burn and then build up to a final battle this third act in my opinion starts with the battle and finishes with the battle. And this movie is called the two towers which I can't really see the other tower but that's fine because I was fully entertained. This definitely works as a sequel. Usually I like movies to  work as their own movie and a sequel but this definitely works as a sequel that you have to watch the first one to get this. The best character in this movie is a Aragorn and gollum and gollum steals to sing for me because he's so twisted and crazy that is very entertaining overall battles are straight up entertaining, the characters were the same as the first one and overall I can't wait for the finale not better than the first one in my opinion but really damn good 9/10"
No Name,5,My favorite of the series.
No Name,4.5,"This one it's a tiny bitty more hard to watch, BUT it's magnificent nevertheless. It's just that the Frodo/Sam/Gollum part is more slow than the Rohan part."
No Name,5,This movie is is very very cool :)
No Name,5,"The Two Towers is incredible for all of the same reasons as the other films in Peter Jackson's trilogy. The siege of Helm's Deep is, for my money, still one of the great battle scenes in cinema.

Still, upon rewatching the extended edition, some of the more intimate scenes really shined through. The ""Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!"" parley had me cracking up. Also, Aragorn's dream/vision of Arwen before he is awoken by Brego. As a dude in my late 30's, there is honestly nothing sexier than the love of your life gently encouraging you to go back to sleep!"
No Name,3.5,"Without a doubt, the trilogy's best. Given that this movie has the atmosphere of an action thriller, Peter Jackson's style of filmmaking truly stands out in this one."
No Name,5,Watched the Extended cut in theaters and seeing that cinematography in the big screens was out of this world
No Name,5,One of the greatest pieces of cinematic art I have ever witnessed
No Name,5,Keeps going strong after the first.
No Name,4,"Excellent casting, and musical score."
No Name,5,Loved every second. Have a blast every time I watch. They did not loose as much of the story from the books in this movie. The only thing that is off is the orcs and uruks are larger and scarier in the films but that is understandable.
No Name,5,Incredible! Amazing! Awesome!
No Name,5,"Fantastic film, could not recommend enough. The Battle for Helm's Deep is my all-time favorite fantasy battle."
No Name,2,N√£o achei uma hist√≥ria bem contada.
No Name,5,"With new alliances, strengthening friendships, unpredictable encounters, and epic battles, the second Lord of the Rings installment effectively turns up the heat on the building adventure."
No Name,5,"A launching, worthy sequel!"
No Name,5,"Great action, great special effects, very good acting and the music is out of this world. The story brought a little tear to my eye more than once, and made me laugh several times.  
In short amazing. I cant think of anything i dislike. 
Making the second film in a trilogy this engaging and breathtaking is an inspicering achievement."
No Name,5,The entire lord of the rings trilogy is easily the best adapted franchise ever made. So entertaining and visually appealing.
No Name,4.5,This trilogy is just so great. In every way.
No Name,5,"Even though this movie is only number two in the trilogy, it can still stand alone as its own movie. I defy ANYBODY who thinks this is a bad movie/trilogy. Don't take it from me, I'm not a critic, just Google Lord of the Rings & see the endless list of awards it rightfully received. I never liked medieval/fantasy in the slightest until Lord of the Rings. If you haven't seen the trilogy, shame on you- you are cheating yourself"
No Name,5,I can really see why everyone loves this movie. Because I certainly do enjoy it.
No Name,5,A fantastic adaptation of the excellent book. Film making that continues to hold up even 20 years after it came out with brilliant writing.
No Name,5,"The sequel continues the epic journey with breathtaking action, unforgettable characters, and a thrilling narrative that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats."

No Name,5,"What is there to say about LOTR that hasn't been said before. Despite being my least favorite of the trilogy, it sets up everything perfectly for the ending.
A master piece."

No Name,5,Greatest movie trilogy ever made.
No Name,5,"Le Due Torri √®, insieme al film successivo, la coppia esplosiva che funge da cavallo di battaglia a questa saga"
No Name,5,One of the best films I have ever seen.
No Name,5,Continua√ß√£o de um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos base√°do em um dos livros mais bem escritos no mundo. Jornada e personagens macantes.
No Name,5,The final battle really done it! Was also really fun watching Gollum. Andy Serkis is just a treasure that needs to be protected. Filming at its peak..
No Name,4.5,A masterpiece of film but just off a little from the novels. Still a fantastic movie overall.
No Name,5,Must watch best trilogy of all time
No Name,5,Greatest trilogy of all time!
No Name,5,Really good I love this one
No Name,5,"Someone said that a secuel is never better than the first part, well this is not the case, this secuel is just amazing, great sms, and of course that battle is mindblowing"
No Name,5,"Amazing characters, great progression and excellent retelling of a classic novel. So good I bought the extended edition which IMO is absolutely worthwhile for all the little bits of immersion."
No Name,5,Absolutely spectacular
No Name,5,No explanation needed. Just watch it.
No Name,5,Love all the movies in this series.  Some of my top movies to see before you die for sure.
No Name,5,"Best trilogie of all movies.
Best adaptation of Tolkien Works.
Best fantasy movies."
No Name,5,"Perfect, simply a top shelf"
No Name,5,Um dos melhores filmes j√° criados pela humanidade.
No Name,5,"Another masterpiece in the LotR trilogy. Every thing that was perfect in the Fellowship carries over into this film. The excellent cast has new additions that are just as perfect as the actors in the previous film. Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin give solid and emotional performances and new members Andy Serkis (Gollum) and Bernard Hill (Theodon) steal the scenes they're in. Like in the first film, the practical make up and effects for all the orcs are great and really well done and the visual effects were great for their time and still hold up really well today. The battle at Helms Deep is one of the greatest battles in film history. Overall, this is a perfect follow up to a perfect film in a perfect trilogy."
No Name,5,LotR trilogy are three of the best movies ever made.
No Name,5,Great film and greatest trilogy
No Name,5,"I loved this movie, a must watch for sure"
No Name,5,"This movie carries you from movie one to movie three, but it does it so splendidly as to outshine both. This is the good part of Lord of the Rings, the characters have been introduced, the stage has been set, and now you can sit back and watch them be epic, or funny, or heart-wrenching. Every character is so compelling and every scene is filled with purpose. This movie lights a beacon that might never be surpassed by another adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien's work."
No Name,2.5,"It's okay. Great writing, decent pacing, but very boring."
No Name,5,Entire Lord of the Rings series 10/10.
No Name,3,"√Ä l'image de ce qu'on attendait
Apr√®s le premier opus √† l'immense succ√®s, le deuxi√®me volet est aux attentes des esp√©rances.

Un peu moins bien que le premier, il reste quand m√™me incroyable et comme son pr√©d√©cesseur, l'histoire, les acteurs/actrices, l'attention aux d√©tails et les pr√©cisions sont remarquable. Tout est exceptionnellement bien √©crit et tourn√© et les d√©cors sont magnifiques.

Ce deuxi√®me volet est toujours un exemple pour les adaptations de romans fantastique au cin√©ma."
No Name,5,"Una obra de arte, mejor adaptaci√≥n de un libro a una pel√≠cula que he visto, espectacular banda sonora y gran actuaci√≥n de los actores, una pel√≠cula que hay que verla para sentirse sumergido en el universo de Tolkien"
No Name,5,This movie just like the predecessor truly is a masterpiece.There is not one scene that does not contain any meaning for the movie.All three films have an amazing opening in their own way.In the first we get the exposition dump but it is shown aswell as told in a beautiful flashback.The second films opening is personally my favorite it shows gandalf who died in the first fighting a fire and shadow demon what more could you have.And the third has a origin story for a fan favorite character.The battle of helms deep is and will remain the best on screen battle in film history it is build up so masterfully that it honestly never gets boring.Must watch for all best 3 hours of you life(until you get to the third).
No Name,5,The greatest 02 hours: and 59 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Name,5,"I love all the Lord of the Rings sagas, especially this one."
No Name,5,Undeniable masterpiece
No Name,5,A perfect film trilogy worth watching for Sam alone. Amazing.
No Name,5,"While this is not perfectly accurate, its still really good, and is and always will be the best LotR adaptation.  Anyone who decides to make a new adaptation of Tolkien needs to rot in Hell for all eternity."
No Name,3.5,"good film once again, not as much happened compared to the other films, but was better than the first film and getting ready for the last film."
No Name,5,"""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"", expands on the world of Tolkien, whilst still capturing everything that was loved about the first film."
No Name,5,"this trilogy is the kind of thing Amazon can only dream of making, but never succeeding."
No Name,5,"Truly one of THE BEST stories ever told, if not THE BEST! Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING about this movie is INCREDIBLE!  Such beautiful scenery and sets, an incredible score by Howard Shore, excellent acting and effects! I COULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MORE! DOUBLE THUMBS UP! 20/10 STARS!"
No Name,5,an incredible and epic odyssey
No Name,5,It‚Äôs sooooo brilliant! This trilogy is the best there is still! I need more!  Xx
No Name,3.5,"Its a Lord of the Rings movie, so I think it was great. But it is my least favorite of the three"
No Name,4.5,"This is my least favorite of the trilogy. But that's like having the dullest gold medal. It just seems like the first 2/3 of this movie is where the story starts to get bogged down with extraneous dialogue scenes. It still has all of the good elements of the other 2, as well as the introduction of some of the best CGI ever done in the gollum character. The battle of Helm's Deep is also an epic conclusion to the middle chapter that can't be forgotten. 9/10"
No Name,5,One Word Masterpiece
No Name,5,I give this film a 9000000! right just like Fellowship and Return!
No Name,5,"The second best of the trilogy which is saying a lot since watching this alone, one would say it's perfect. The film arguably has the best battle in the franchise and perhaps the greatest supporting actor performance in history; Andy Serkis' Gollum/Smeagol. It fits in seamlessly with the other 2 films, likely due to the movies all being filmed at the same time and the flawless direction from Peter Jackson."
No Name,5,Anything less than a 5 star is just not acceptable this movie is amazing the whole franchise is amazing I wish it was the first time for me to see these movies again 10/10
No Name,5,"Even better than the first, one love These movies"
No Name,3.5,Almost perfect sequel that will make you can't wait for the final chapter.
No Name,5,An absolute master piece. One of the best trilogies of all time.
No Name,4,"I don't like how this movie changes a bunch of stuff about the war in Rohan, shortens distances and empties lands. This could have been done better. Still, compared to the Amazonian disaster, this is a masterpiece.

Tip: watch the EXTENDED EDITION. It's much better than the standard one."
No Name,3.5,still good but it moves kind of slow compared to the first movie.
No Name,4.5,Another fantastic adventure despite being the middle chapter
No Name,5,"endlessly rewatchable, iconic as ever"
No Name,4.5,The ultimate and definitive epic!
No Name,5,Amazing adaptation. I'd give it 100 stars if I could.
Jadan S,5,"A perfect follow-up to Fellowship, The Two Towers stands the test of time with brilliant characters, gorgeous visuals, and unforgettable action."
No Name,5,"This has the advantage of hitting the ground running, but, like most middle episodes, if seen in isolation would be without a start or a finish. Jackson's staggering achievement is to bring Tolkein's material to life in an epic way, whilst retaining a clear understanding of the dense narrative and dynamic settings and cultures. The cast is excellent and approach their roles with genuine authority. The visuals are amongst the finest ever seen in cinema, whilst the action set-pieces continue to dazzle. The finale Battle for Helm's Deep is jaw-dropping in its delivery. At three hours the film still manages to grip the viewer throughout and skillfully sets up its audience for the final segment."
No Name,4,"What's to say that hasn't already been said. Great movie, maybe better to watch in chunks"
No Name,5,"This is simply the best fantasy trilogy of all time. So much care and passion went into this. Fantastic. Yes, it¬¥s a bit different than the books but it never - ever - changes what the story is about and what Tolkien intened it to be. You have a fantastic script, spot on actors who give everything they have, great visuals, props and camera-work, superp directing and one of the best scores ever written. 
I highly recommend the extended cut because it is even better than the theatrical cut."
No Name,5,"I grew up with Tolkien from reading him in grade school. I am an old man now. Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts. But that said, these 3 LOR movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many, many years to come."

No Name,5,unbelivable great!!!!
No Name,5,"This is a movie that I could watch over and over and never get bored. No fantasy movie/tv series could rival this trilogy, especially the ones from the present."
No Name,5,"Jackson manages to effectively condense the second part of the Lord of the Rings novel into a cohesive, gripping sequel to Fellowship. The characters, lore, and story are all phenomenal."
No Name,5,"His sword fell off, how is the movie not great?"
No Name,5,An All Time Classic. One of the best sequels ever made. The acting along with the character development is top notch across the board. The Special Effects are Phenomenal with a perfect balance of practical and Digital effects. The pacing is perfect along with masterful editing that effortlessly weaves between all the characters and new ones. The anticipation built up for the end fight is excellent as well and delivers. Everyone should give this a watch.
No Name,5,Masterpiece. No more words required.
No Name,4.5,As good as the first one. Perfect writing and acting
No Name,4,9/11 reference - Light 8/10
No Name,5,This movie is amazing!!   I am a lifelong fan of Tolkien and this is a 90%+ Wow!!
No Name,5,"The best movie ever made! With the best directing from Peter Jackson! Plus the best editing ever done in a movie! Also, the best movie costumes ever designed! As well as the best makeup and hairstyling ever done in a movie! Not to mention the best sound mixing ever done in a movie! Not only that, but the best sound editing ever done in a movie! And the best visual effects ever done in a movie!"
No Name,5,"Timeless movie!
Words can't even begin to describe how in love I am with this next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister. Even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from Elijah Wood to Sean Aston to Billy Boyd to Ian Mchellen to Orlando Bloom to Viggo Mortenson to Miranda Otto to Bernard Hill to Christopher Lee to Liv Tyler to John Rhys-Davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with Peter Jackson behind the whole wheel. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old I get? No, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!"
No Name,5,one of the most amazing piece of art ive ever seen
No Name,5,one of the best movies ever made
No Name,5,Gran adaptaci√≥n al cine del universo de Tolkien. Es muy fiel al canon aunque tomando las licencias justas para adaptarlo al cine
No Name,5,This is literally the best movie of all time.
No Name,5,Amazing movie! The actors are great and the CGI is good.
No Name,5,New era of Midle age movies!
No Name,5,One of the greatest sequels I ever watched in my life. The story is just too good to be true. The movie alone is more goated. I will never forget this and it is clearly a must watch!
No Name,5,"de lo mejor en la historia del cine, una historia maravillosa que fue muy bien llevada a la pantalla"
No Name,5,"uma obra prima do Cinema, uma verdadeira obra de arte que envelheceu bem.... dificilmente alguem far√° algo no mesmo nivel."
No Name,4.5,Great cast. Great adaptation. Great CGI. I think Gollum is the show stealer!
No Name,5,I can't recall how many times I've watched this movie but whenever it plays on TV I don't care if I have school or work the next day.
No Name,5,Over the top even after 20 years!
No Name,5,"Una autentica joya.
Acci√≥n, actuaciones, efectos visuales, m√∫sica, escenograf√≠a, vestuario y maquillaje perfectos. La cuspide del cine de fantas√≠a. Y si ves la versi√≥n extendida es aun mejor."
No Name,4,Loved it.  Enjoyed watching the books come to life.
No Name,5,"Rohirrim! Perfection - Middle-Earth as it should be. After so many years this movie and the whole trilogy, rewatched one 1000 times and still my favourites by far. Thank you, Peter Jackson and JRR Tolkien."
No Name,5,Helms deep is perhaps my favorite movie scene of all time. Such a great movie in such a great series. After forcing myself through rings of power I have a new appreciation for this movie and trilogy
No Name,4.5,"It's very long, buts it's still very good."
No Name,5,Even better than the Fellowship and the Fellowship is almost perfect. Why couldn't they have a decent writer to work on the Rings of Power like they did for this?
No Name,3.5,"The technically flawless second edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best representation of the Middle Earth world available. In this grand conflict between good and evil, the characters offer the audience a lot to cling onto as well. In this episode, Frodo and Sam continue their search for Moldor in order to destroy the ring, and they are using technology to follow Gollum, who is portrayed by Andy Serkis. We follow a few Hobbits and their tree companions, a few other fellowship members as they attempt to aid Gondor in fending off its foes, and the ascent of the wizard of Gondorf in a few of the side stories. The stories all flow together and have the same good against evil theme."
No Name,5,"Best movie, for ever and ever"
No Name,5,"It's my least favourite of the three, but as far as trilogies go this should be considered the perfect second installment."
No Name,5,The battle for Helm's Deep stands as one of the most exiting battle scenes ever!
No Name,5,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an epic sequel to an epic predecessor, and takes our favorite characters into a new adventure riddled with incredible action and memorable moments."
No Name,3.5,"too many changes from the book. important characteristics of important characters are either changed or forgotten. and Gimli, one of the most formidable warriors of middle earth is constantly made to be the butt of jokes."
No Name,5,Seen in theaters at 7 PM and left at 11:30 PM. Worth it.
No Name,5,Filme inesquec√≠vel! Adapta√ß√£o quase perfeita
No Name,5,A classic. Fantasy at its finest.
No Name,5,Best trilogy of all time!
No Name,5,Best of Movies/TV Series Collection
Christian Lindke,5,The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a cinematic classic with The Two Towers as a key entry in the series. The Extended Version adds some wonderful moments.
Megan,5,Still a great movie after all these years!
No Name,5,Epic timeless Movie. Great composing of music and screen.
No Name,5,"Excelente, mereceu todos pr√™mios que ganhou."
No Name,5,A great sequel to the trilogy. Tolkien would be proud
No Name,5,"This is probably my favorite movie out of the 3. Its awesome to see a human, dwarf , and elf in the original RPG party. lol"
No Name,4.5,The worst of the trilogy in my personal opinion. Still an absolute masterpiece though.
No Name,5,An amazing classic. One of the greatest epic adventures of all time.
No Name,5,Arguably the best Tolkien project ever made. The battles are epic and the character work is second to none. Great directing and writing. Very few flaws with pacing being the only thing that could have improved but not sure it actually would make the movie better.
No Name,5,"It's hard to believe, given how great the 1st movie in the trilogy was, that there was no drop off in quality in the 2nd film, but there wasn't. It's every bit as good as The Fellowship of the Ring with the added bonus of the greatest battle scene [Helm's Deep] in cinematic history."
No Name,5,"very good movie, with an ending that leaves everyone very emotional, with a great story it is difficult to go wrong."
No Name,5,"I had my doubts Peter Jackson could maintain the cinematic excellence and storytelling brilliance in this second installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but he does, introducing more characters, weaving in the lore, and keeping up the pace. After this film, I knew without a doubt this trilogy was the greatest in movie history."
No Name,5,"Best Trilogy...This second one is my favorite, especially the extended version with the Ents(Trees)"
No Name,5,The movie was amazing an epic of its time which has stood the test of time
No Name,4.5,"Beautiful and some really touching moments. Not as close to perfection as the other two, but a must-see nonetheless."
No Name,5,"Hermosa pelicula, la batalla del Abismo de Helm es sin dudas mi favorita de la trilogia"
No Name,5,"I loved the Two Towers.  The opening scene with Gandalf and the Balrog was incredible film making.  Really great film.  There was just a couple of things that annoyed me, but for the most part... 5 stars."

No Name,5,"Beautiful adaptation.   Faithful to the books! 
Loaded with action and incredible special effects.  Sure they made the compromises, but overall it sticks to the originals and provide a very good view of the I imagined while reading the stories."
No Name,4.5,"Un film qui vous coupe le souffle et qui vous entraine dans un monde fantastique.
Les films de la trilogie sont √† voir en rafale :)"
No Name,5,Improving on its errors in every way possible. The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is a perfectly paced film with its spectacular performance especially Gollum and his CGI capture.
No Name,5,The second part is at the same time the second best part of the trillogy and thus also a masterpiece that is unparalleled!
No Name,5,I still watch the LOTR Trilogy at least once a year. Absolutely Brilliant Trilogy!
No Name,5,"What a fantastic movie.  From start to finish the movie captivates you in the moment. The CGI editing is on point, the acting is stellar, and pace of the movie moved very well."

No Name,5,A must see to anyone who respect themselves
No Name,5,"My personal favourite of the trilogy
I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.

When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.

The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.

In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10"
No Name,5,"I took five days to watch this movie because it's so long, but it was worth it. I am now starting to read the books, we'll see how faithfull this movie actually is, but for now, it is great."
No Name,5,"This broadens the scope of the world created by Tolkien, allowing for the full breadth of the emotions and underlying gravitas of everything that revolves it"
No Name,4.5,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
No Name,1,"Peter Jackson takes the original narrative, strips it down to its bare bones, and fills in the rest of the story with his own ideas that do not reflect the original story in any way; I'm glad Tolkien isn't alive to witness such a massacre."
No Name,5,The best movies and series of all time.
No Name,5,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an incredible movie realised by Peter Jackson. It's a fantasy film. He was written by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. The soundtrack was composed by Howard Shore. The film was realised in 2002. The main actors are Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellen.

""The Two Towers"" follows the continuing quest of Frodo and the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring. Frodo and Sam discover they are being followed by the mysterious Gollum. Aragorn, the Elf archer Legolas, and Gimli the Dwarf encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom, whose once great King Theoden has fallen under Saruman's deadly spell.
""The Two Towers"" received 75 nominations, 65 wins with 6 Academy Awards.

The acting is realistic and outstanding. The screenplay is very enigmatic and entertaining. I find the soundtrack beautiful and gripping. The atmosphere is epic and manipulative. 

For me, this film is a truly great piece of filmmaking. Also, I give this film a 5 !"
No Name,5,Completely outstanding movie! The writing is excellently done and the stakes have gone up drastically from the first installment.
No Name,5,"This is my favorite of the trilogy. I love how they divided the characters up so that they can grow stronger relationships with one another. And also making them the focus and we focus on how they grow, change, and become more likeable. It's a little harder to grow your characters when they are all together. Some movies succeed at that and some fail. But Peter Jackson played a genius move by having them split up in order to focus on some more. There is more action in this one and I loved that. The battle for helms deep wasn't just a minute and I liked that because it's a big thing that happened. And I was intrigued through and through. Gollum I think was properly introduced in this movie. The adventure advanced really well compared to the others. The other movies have great adventure but I like this one a little more. If I had to critique one thing, I think they spent a little to much time with Rohan. Some of it was engaging but after a while I think they should've moved on. In the first movie it made sense because they had to help the king but after a while I felt like they should've moved on. The acting was great and I think if you loved the first you'll love this one."
No Name,5,Always going to be the best in my book!
No Name,5,"I can't believe I am just now finding out about this series, it is so amazing!"
No Name,5,This is my favorite in the trilogy!
No Name,5,Absolute Masterpiece <3
No Name,5,"Two towers did a fantastic job following up Fellowship. This movie separates our ring bearing group and allows them to have their own journeys simultaneously, and juggles it well. Near perfect movie and great 2nd part of the greatest trilogy of all time!"
No Name,5,"The Two Towers is still an absolutely fantastic movie and is nearly perfect, but I think that Fellowship of the Ring is just a little bit better.  Gollum is obviously an absolute scene stealer every single time that he is on screen.  The final battle in Helm's Deep is grand and fantastical as well as emotional and sometimes comedic.  Just an overall amazing film and a great follow-up to the first."
No Name,4.5,"Although all three of the movies are really good, Two Towers is still my third favorite one. It's still a very good film. In many aspects, it improves upon the first film. There are obvious new characters and locations, there is much more CGI and the battle scenes get much bigger. The battle of Helm's Deep is just truly epic and well choreographed.

I must say, Gollum is exceptional. He was a HUGE technical achievement in 2002. His character is meant to be a villain, yet he is very sympathetic. And yes, ""My precious!"" is one of the best lines of this century. The Two Towers also has all the qualities that make up most good second films in a trilogy. It ends in a point where the heroes are at danger or have lost. This will make their victory in the final movie much stronger. Frodo and Sam are in danger by the end as they have teamed up with an untrustworthy ally, Gollum.

Honestly it is very hard to compare all the three movies and everyone might have their favorite because all three of them are amazing. Even though this is the weaker one it is still one of the best films of the 2000s. It really shows what a great trilogy this is. Everything great about the first film is still there here which is part of what makes it such a good sequel."
No Name,5,Best trilogy of all time!!!
No Name,4.5,"The scope gets bigger, the stakes are higher, in other words, the spectacular second part grants a thrilling viewing experience. It just flows perfectly and it never stops; it benefits so much from the long runtime. The epic battle of Helms Deep tops the movie exquisitely, setting the bar high for the final."
No Name,5,"I think this holds the #3 spot of the trilogy only because it is the bridge b/w the beginning and the end... obviously still an amazing movie, highly recommend!!!"
No Name,4.5,"Best of the trilogy (but not by a long shot). Mostly because of Andy Serkis, we saw a darn lot of him in this movie and it was completely necessary for this films success. I highly recommend  watching the two part extended version. Trust me, once you watch it, you will never want to watch the original again."
No Name,5,"The most underrated film in the trilogy, simply because the others are so good. It is a testament to the series' quality that the movie containing the Battle of Helm's Deep is the least beloved."
No Name,5,Great spectacular of a film great battle scenes my favourite of the trilogy  . Great cast
No Name,5,"The second installment in The Lord of the Rings franchise proves just as, if not more, incredible than Fellowship.  Andy Serkis, Elijah Wood, and Sean Astin are enthralling as the three hobbits (one heroic, one corrupted, and one working in the direction of the latter), and Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen outshine nearly every other performance in the history of cinema.  Epic battles and heartfelt dialogue capture the exact reason that I go to watch movies."
No Name,5,"Probably my favourite of the trilogy, the battle scenes and storyline with all the characters, outstanding and watched 20+ times.. can't go wrong"
No Name,5,Best trilogy ever!!!
No Name,5,"Perhaps of the best movie of all time, this movie has so much character development, so much good scenery and so much good in general. The battle scene is the best battle scene you shall ever see, there is absolutely nothing to complain about. No flaws. This movie should be 100% rating. Another point: this movie changes barely anything from the beloved books. Great movie"
No Name,5,Peak filmmaking - just an unbelievable experience that can‚Äôt be contained in the screen and bursts out into the room.
No Name,4.5,"Amazing film again. Slight, just slight drop off compared to the other two films. But fantastic battle scenes and battle of helms deep was amazing. Great character development of Frodo, Sam, Gollum etc. Slower paced at the beginning to get the story set up properly. But still amazing."
No Name,5,"Although this is my least favorite of the trilogy, it remains my 3. favourite movie of all time. It features one of the best battles of this century."
No Name,5,The Battle of Helms Deep is still intense after 20 years!
No Name,5,"This movie perfectly brings the atmosphere from the book to the watchers! It's at the same time touching, has perfectly planned action and an encouraging message for all who feel hopeless."
No Name,4.5,"Number two, lets get it!

Wow this cinematography. I mean WOW. It is so simple yet so gorgeous and the colors always match so perfectly in every scene. A marvelous film to look at and very admirable camera work across the board. The transitions in-between scenes, the shift in colors, my word it's gorgeous. I can't stop saying that, this cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.

The VFX are stunning! Gollem is horrifying and the moving trees look so real‚Ä¶ something hard to come by when you're making an inanimate object a living being.

And can we talk about this acting?? Not really from Legolas‚Ä¶ but everyone else is soooo good. I love the characters of Aragorn and Gimli. Phenomenal actors (Viggo in specific) and great characters that they're portraying!

The goosebumps that this score gives me is unmatched by any other OST. Like it is just so beautiful and intense and I love it, I could listen to it forever.

There are quite a few times where I found myself sitting there during a conversation wondering what in the world did this add to the story? And most of them, the answer is nothing. No wonder the film is 3 hours long!

Short review on this one. Loved all the action, loved the music and the dramatic camera work. Far surpasses the first. Insanely excited for The Return Of The King!

Is it really a fight scene if there's not a wilhelm scream? So unnecessary yet so crucial."
No Name,5,Rather fabulous. One of the very greatest movies of all time. I suspect this will be one of the most watched movies again as fans cleanse their soul from Amazon.

No Name,5,The best movie of the trilogy.

No Name,4,"A perfect continuation of the story, characters develop and sets up a final chapter you are begging to see."
No Name,5,"Best sequel of all times, wow!!!"
No Name,4.5,"Being a purist who's read the book at least 15 times, I might not be able to give anything related to it five stars, but this film comes as close as anything probably ever will. There are some scenes that are so astounding as to boggle the mind. The acting is mostly perfect, and the story is rousing and emotionally resonant. I give is 95%, just like the other two installments. It's a great achievement."
No Name,0.5,"Bit of a nonsense really, suits under 12s. Poor plot points, horrible acting, and unnecessary scenes dropped in."
No Name,5,Simply the best movie !
No Name,5,"Though not as good as the original, ""The Two Towers"" is still a masterpiece that continues the journey of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, etc. with much more at stake, introducing new and memorable characters that are played perfectly due to the outstanding casting choices. The ending is very emotional, and ends off on yet another cliffhanger that keeps viewers excited to see the conclusion."
No Name,4,Not often does a trilogy hold up so well
No Name,5,"The story continues as Frodo and Sam reluctantly ally with Villian Gollum, (Andy Serkis in a CGI-fied but brilliant performance) Aragorn and the Others get unexpected new Allies, a beloved Character returns from the dead, and an epic battle at the Helms deep stronghold (complete with rain) takes place. Plus a skateboarding Elf, and a cocky Dwarf have an orc killing contest. It‚Äôs a really great second film, though it gets overlooked sometimes compared to the first and the third films."
No Name,5,Wonderful journey. It brings a new world to people.
No Name,5,Uno dei film migliori di sempre
No Name,5,"I've run out of good things to say about LOTR, so I'm just going to do my due diligence and leave a 5-star review.  Helms Deep, the final scene/segue into the climax.  It's just perfect."
No Name,5,"Continues on from the first movie extremely well, sets the scenes for the amazing third instalment.
Battle for Helms Deep is theatrically portrayed absolutely brilliantly"
No Name,5,"In comparison to the other two LOTR movies it lacks a bit of moment...the adaptation from the books is less good than in the first movie, the epicness and emotional impact less than in the thirs movie. Still one of the greatest movies ever due to the impossibly good scenes/sets, the great story-writing and acting and the effects"
No Name,4,"Filme extremamente bom, por√©m para mim esse fica um pouco arrastado."
No Name,5,One of the best movies of all time
No Name,5,Second greatest film of all time. Just behind Fellowship of the Ring.
No Name,5,"The strengths of the first movie didn't necessarily carry over to this one, but it was still fantastic in its own right with its own set of attributes that made it so. Most notable by far were the film score, arguably the most memorable of the three movies, followed by the introduction of Gollum and the revolutionary CGI quality that came with him. The flaws in this one have the benefit of being made much worse by their expansion in the third movie, that being the deus ex machina and Frodo's transformation into a burdensome wuss, and even those could be considered more a gripe with the source material than the actual filmmakers. The final battle is truly something to behold here, both for its obvious high quality and for the endless series of LOTR videogames with levels based on it."
No Name,4.5,"[‚≠êÔ∏è89%]

The second movie in the Lord of the Rings franchise, The Two Towers (2002) maintains the same quality as its predecessor as well as expanding upon it in other places such as the world and creatures.

As the Fellowship is broken, the remaining former members are separated into smaller groups which actually allows for some development for characters, whether they are important like Aragorn or more of a side character like Pippin.

The Two Towers (2002) actually offers a lot more greater things than The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) with diving deeper into themes about the hypnosis the Ring provides as well as some huge scale battles, however the pace is a lot slower and more dialogue heavy than its predecessor, which at points can be really long to sit through.

Other than it's slower pace, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) provides yet another fantastic addition to the trilogy."
No Name,0.5,Half a star cause of Sm√©agol‚Ä¶..
No Name,4,"Now this is how you make a sequel. The Two Towers not only gets us more invested with our characters. But adds more that are also likeable. It cranks up the action, the special effects, and story to make us want to know how it ends."
No Name,3,Honestly this isn‚Äôt that bad its actually really good but the other two are much better
Cody,5,"I love the extended edition of Lord of the rings, all of them. We unfortunately had to leave early due to the comfiness of the theatre chairs. Didn't want to snore and disturb the other viewers."
Michael C,5,"The Two Towers will ALWAYS be worth a watch. The star cast of knighted sirs, Ian McKellen, Chris Lee, Elijah Wood are all so emotive and brilliant. The picturesque imagery and raw evocative emotions of the human race are so beautifully portrayed and it deserved every single last Oscar it won."
No Name,5,"You can get better then The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers. The battle scenes are intense, entertaining and incredibly done, and the story is shown beautifully and extremely entertaining! I promise you you wont regret watching this movie! A MUST SEE. 100%"
No Name,4.5,"The Two Towers is probably my favourite of the books and the film is also fantastic. Certain aspects are done perfectly; Fangorn Forest and the Ents could not be better, and nor could the character of Gollum. Scenes involving Gollum are certainly the best in the movie. Other performances are also about as excellent as they could possibly be. Main negative is that some of the battle scenes (particularly the one at Helm's Deep) go on longer than they need to. The Aragorn and Arwen scenes are really cringe, but I suppose they have to be there."
No Name,4,"More compelling, action-packed, and gloriously epic than the first! Plus, more captivating and treacherous characters in the mix!"
No Name,4.5,"Split between Frodo and Sam on one hand and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on the other, there can be a bit of a pacing issue here. Frodo and Sam's side can be a little more boring, but there's certainly enough to keep you interested. Sure, it can be dark, like its predecessor, but there's also triumph in it."
No Name,4,"It's good, but has fewer interesting things happening than the other LOTR"
No Name,4.5,"Unlike the 3 installments of The Hobbit which should never have been broken up into 3 Movies,  Lord of the Rings each installment is worthy of 4 to 5 stars!"
No Name,4.5,"Suffers from sophomore slump just a tad, but it's still brilliance."
No Name,5,"Another brilliant performance. This one strays a little further from the books, but not in a horrible way p"
Andrew K,5,Great movie! Love the book and this movie!
No Name,5,"The Two Towers (like the rest of the LOTR films) delivers great action, a perfect soundtrack, relatable characters, and an entertaining plot. It also brings the much needed relief for the tension set up in the Fellowship of the Ring. It's a fantastic movie in a fantastic franchise, however I like the other features in the trilogy better."
No Name,4.5,It's hard make another one of The Lord of The Rings` Saga with the same spirit of the first one but The Two Towers really did it. 9/10
No Name,5,Still the holder of best battle scene of all time.  Best of the trilogy.
No Name,5,Continues where The Fellowship started. Beautiful movie.
No Name,5,Best movies of all time!
No Name,5,This is in my opinion the best Lor Of The Rings movie. Gollum is such a good character
No Name,5,"The Lord of the Rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. I have already written a review for The Fellowship of the Ring, in which I talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. That is why I won't talk about those things in this review. Rather I will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation.

Percy Jackson has done a really great job. The story picks up from the part where Gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. This not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. While previously we believed Gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. This is the reason why it paid off to see him return as Gandalf the White.

The thing I really like aobut Gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. In one moment he is being spun around by Saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. In the first movie he scared Bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the Hobbits in the party. This is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. This way we get to see him from multiple perspectives.

The second character I'd talk about here would be Gollum. The first time I saw him I thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (Jar Jar from Star Wars prequels, Dobby from Harry Potter etc). But he's very different. Earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. However, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. Now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. This is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt Frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. This message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself.

Speaking of the scene where Gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. This is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something Peter Jackson was able to handle. Even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how Gollum was feeling while planning to kill Frodo and not how he was actually looking like. There have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you.

And that scene was interrupted by Sam, who is the next character I'd speak about. Sam is Frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure Frodo is safe. He is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped Frodo from wearing the ring. Sam had heard that Gollum wanted to kill Frodo and even though Gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the Mountain of Doom, Sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. Frodo didn't trust him or rather should I say, didn't WANT to trust him. And in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, Sam never wasted any time to get back to saving Frodo.

The movie also has many battle scenes, cool CGI, shows the Fellowship of the Ring fight alongside other kingdoms while Gandalf is not there to protect them. The action, the comic timings, the CGI, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. The only mistake I made watching this was that I watched the theatrical cut of this movie. Because of this I missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which I was thinking would be answered in Return of the King. It has something to do with Saruman. So don't make that mistake. I'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch.

The Two Towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and I really wish it was talked about more. Only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. That doesn't mean it's bad. That just means this trilogy should be watched more. Since The Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of the adventures and The Return of the King is the conclusion, The Two Towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. But in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. It is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place."
No Name,5,"The Two Towers somehow improves on its predecessor. Gigantic action, deep character moments, and a heaping of Shakespearean dialogue. This is a movie (no, a film) for the ages."
No Name,5,"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a masterpiece. The Two Towers continues the story of the Fellowship as they travel through the lands of Rohan and the country of Gondor to get to Mordor to destroy the Ring of Power. Gollum is an amazing character and getting to see both sides of him added so much more depth to his character. The Uruk-Hai are menacing in this movie along with Saruman, he actually feels like a real threat along with his foot soldiers and you get the sense that anyone can die in all 3 of these movies, with the stakes being set at the end of Fellowship. But the bar is raised as King Theoden and the people of Rohan retreat to Helm's Deep where they fight what is undeniably one of the greatest battles in cinematic history. I could go about this movie for days, but you get the point. I love it, and I always will."
No Name,5,"(Extended edition)

This one is always better than I remember it being. Definitely the black sheep of the trilogy.

The extended cut isn't as good as Fellowship's in my opinion as there are too many extraneous scenes in this cut that only serve to stifle the pacing. The worst offenders are the additional scenes of Merry & Pippin which were already the slowest parts of the theatrical cut. In this cut we get entire scenes that are utterly pointless and barely add anything, as well as some more comedically focussed scenes that seem awkward and out of place in the overall film.

There are other scenes that help flesh out and develop characters which I feel should have been included in the theatrical version. For example, we get a much better explanation of Aragorn's lineage and history in this cut which is very important given the key role he plays in the plot of The Return of the King.

Overall, I feel the theatrical cut of this film is the superior, especially for a more casual viewer. It may gloss over some aspects, but the pacing is much better. I think I'll continue watching the extended cut though, purely because it has more content."
No Name,5,Amazing a must see clasic
No Name,5,The epic second installment to the greatest trilogy ever created. The masterpiece of Helm's Deep should serve as the ultimate model for any cinematic battle for the future.
No Name,4,"In a sense my score for this is an average between what I consider to be a 3~3.5/5 Theatrical Cut and a 4.5/5 Extended Cut, as these two versions of the movie are very, very different in terms of quality, considerably moreso than either of the other two LotR films.  The biggest problems inherent are in regards to pacing, and establishing the new characters in a way that works as well as in Fellowship (which had considerably more to introduce but somehow did a far better job).  The Extended Cut of The Two Towers still doesn't do as good as Fellowship (or Return, for that matter) in terms of its character dynamics or its extension of world-building, but it is a vast improvement and certainly does an overall good job with both of these.  Simply put, this is one of those movies (like Troy & Chronicles of Riddick) where the Extended Cut's additions are so good at adding much-needed context that, despite their increased run-times, actually feel like much shorter films than their shorter versions.  Like the other two, the Cinematography, Music, Production Design, Sound Design, Acting and Action-Sequences are all top-notch, still effective to this day, and serious props to everyone for managing to successfully make a 45-Minute Action Sequence that managed to keep the stakes high.  It's needed viewing to experience the whole story, and while it's the weakest of the three, it's still usually Very Good quality, only sometimes dipping into ""Good Not Great"" territory from time to time."
No Name,0.5,The worst of the trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Name,4.5,The Battle of Helm's Deep took three months to film and is quite possibly the most fantastic on-screen clash of armies ever filmed.
No Name,1,Golim looks like a cartoon character but Serkis plays him well
No Name,4.5,"Not quite as remarkable as Fellowship or Return but it's still a phenomenal second chapter: the visual effects are still top notch as well as the sets, cinematography, score and costumes/makeup, the action is also a major improvement over the first with the Battle of Helm's Deep obviously being one of the best battles in history, Andy Serkis gives a fantastic performance as Gollum and provides us with a conflicting character that we don't know how to feel about, I also loved seeing how Sauron's take over of Middle Earth is actually affecting Middle Earth as shown with the situation of Rohan. The biggest issue is the pacing of the movie. It drags on in the middle for quite a lot and being the middle chapter, it lacks the setting up of the first movie or the pay off of the third movie and we don't get as many locations and we spend a bit too much time with the Rohan subplot but it's still an emotional, suspenseful, satisfying and exciting second chapter with great characters and moments."
No Name,4,"The Two Towers is grand in spectacle and (eventually) extremely thrilling. As much as I love this installment and the entire series, this middle entry of the series gets a bit bogged down in picking up the pieces of the first and setting up the finale to be independently spectacular. In comparison with the Fellowship of the Ring, the adventure is far less expansive and the protagonists being consistently split makes for a less cohesive story telling. What this movie is most famous for - the battle at Helm's Deep - earns its reputation and is the pinnacle of high fantasy action to date."

No Name,5,"The whole trilogy has so much depth. When you rewatch them after binge reading through all of Tolkiens Middle earth lore. Every line a character utters, every frame in every movie has so much depth behind it. I'm not able to properly describe it in a concise manner. No remake can top Peter Jacksons trilogy. There is so much love and attention to detail. No matter how dated the CGI may look in the future. There is no way they'll be able to ever capture the same magic in film. I just can't imagine it."
No Name,5,"Awesome, just awesome. The battle of helms deep was just amazing. The scenes with Frodo, Sam and Gollum were also magnificent."
No Name,4.5,The trilogy continues in the best way possible.
No Name,5,The final battle is best move battle ever. The trio friendship is so amazing
No Name,4.5,"This is the middle film so it has 3 hours (or so) of straight awesome plot lines and action. The only thing it starts or ends, is the battle of Morannon. This battle starts the next movie perfectly."
No Name,5,The Two Towers is the most perfect sequel and is true art to cinema.
No Name,5,O melhor filme da saga. O primeiro j√° era perfeito mas esse segundo trascedeu ainda mais minhas expectativas. Recomendo assistir n√£o s√≥ a esse filme mas sim toda a franquia.
No Name,5,"By far the best film of the trilogy, with Gollum and his internal conflict a mesmerising watch and creative how they do it. The development of characters and return of Gandalf is well done and Treebeard, Merry and Pippin as some light relief to the film. Sam's speech about hope is relevant to whatever situation you are it"
No Name,4.5,this is my fav out of this amazing trilogy because I love the battle of Helm's deep and contains amazing moments throughout.
No Name,5,While the weakest movie in the trilogy The Two Towers does a lot of heavy lifting. It's largely the most uneventful but it's still a strong middle chapter. The Battle for Helm's Deep has a relatively slow buildup but it also effectively kicks the trilogy into a higher gear - it's so epic.
No Name,5,Um filme melhor que o primeiro que j√° estava num nivel de um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos.
Sir Harry Dresden,5,Never has a trilogy been this good and never has there been since.
Todd,5,I liked everything!!!! lotr is my favorite movies of all time!!!!
Justin,5,"There is nothing negative that can be said about this movie. 5 stars, 100%, 10/10, etc."
No Name,4,"I might not have enjoyed it as much as the first film, but 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is still a terrific film no doubt.

Visually it still looks superb, I really do love the look of these films so far. The main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. There is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences.

There are, though, a few bits I found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. I found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. Bernard Hill. The side story, meanwhile, with Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.

Elijah Wood remains good though. I did enjoy seeing the journey of Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). Andy Serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as Gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! Any scene with those three = outstanding.

Overall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. One very much worthy of following 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring', despite a few 'issues' I have with it."
No Name,4,"A step down in quality, but still good! This movie has sever pacing issues, with two of the hobbits ( the funny ones) on probably the most boring storyline ever, and the main crew following their steps in a lame detective chase for a while. Once they stop that, the movie really hits its mark, and has alot of cool stuff! +1 star for aragorn being sexy"
No Name,5,Just as good as the first one. This movie is just as faithful to the books as the original movie and the story gets much more dark and exciting.
Lino,5,This movie will always be awesome! Even more seeing it IMAX.
No Name,5,"This trilogy is the first novel to movie adaptation of a fantasy novel or series that has ever worked, in my opinion.

Gold Standard"
No Name,4,"The first film's sprawling, epic world is still in good hands! While it certainly is a step down from the Fellowship of the Ring, it still brings you a sense of awe. Andy Serkis is masterful as Gollum, and the added in humor is a wise decision, making this a worthy road to the final installment. Frodo and Sam do not appear as much though, and the fight scenes are too plentiful to really feel excited towards the next one, because you really know who is going to win, and you wonder why the editing isn't here enough. Still, I feel optimistic that the Return of the King learn from its predecessors mistakes and reach a stunning victory."
No Name,5,"The characters, story and world are incredibly put together and Peter Jackson has done a fantastic job adapting the books.  I didn't know anything about Tolkien prior to the first in the trilogy being released so I read the Hobbit in preparation. What followed over the next three years watching these films was the most memorable movie experiences I've ever had. These films brought me to tears in certain parts, something which is exceptionally rare with me as I'm not an emotional person whatsoever. I read the trilogy after and still to this day hold Tolkiens world in high regard."
No Name,5,A little weaker than the first and third instalments however it is still magnificent and one of the best films of all time. Of course it's weaker state is due to the fact that it got the middle portion of the story which usually conveys more storytelling and building up rather than memorable and epic sequences.
No Name,5,Best of the LOTR movies
No Name,3.5,An improvement over its predecessor for sure. Two Towers substitutes long sequences getting to know characters for sharper action and battle sequences while adding some nice new characters to the mix. A good middle chapter
No Name,4,Not bad as compare it to Harry Potter series
No Name,5,"The rating ""So Fresh: Absolute Must See!"" summarizes what must be done..."
No Name,5,"6 bags, the gold standard of high fantasy returns! its an action packed explosion of stars; Chucky from Childs Play joins in the fun, as does Judge Dredd. It was cool to see the two towers and the part with the trees is slow but its ok cause they're trees is supposed to be boring that's just good film making. don't think we have forgotten about the precious, RT. gives us super reviewer."
No Name,5,This movie is being so fantastic and awesome!
No Name,4.5,"Epic, Emotional and Beautiful"
No Name,4.5,"The second part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy introduces new characters, more epic battles, and the best visual effect presented in these films with Gollum. The story has also become more enticing, as it starts to feel grittier and bigger in scale."
No Name,4.5,"A very good movie, probably the weakest in the Lord of the Rings franchise, but still really awesome."
No Name,5,"As i said on my fellowship review, the lord of the rings trilogy is perfection and this is my second favourite"
No Name,5,One of the best movies ever made everything was done well a movie without sin
No Name,5,"It's great! But not as great as the first one. It's enjoyable, but it feels like a bridge between the the first one and the third one. It does have an amazing final battle!"
No Name,5,"The best out of all LOTR and Hobbit films (including the animated), TWO TOWERS is the Dark Knight of the LOTR trilogy, boasting the best storytelling, action, character development, emotions, and cinematography. It is also the lowest rated, which is idiotic."
No Name,5,My favorite. what an epic trilogy.
No Name,5,"These movies are at their fullest when you watch the Extended Editions, and just like Fellowship of the Ring, Two Towers is one of the best fantasy movies ever filmed."
No Name,5,The two towers continues the best trilogy ever by showing what are characters must do to continue the journey without failing.
No Name,5,My favorite movie series! I love everything about this movie!
No Name,5,"A perfect sequel, a perfect movie, and near-perfect adaptation."
No Name,4.5,"Though it is quite a tonal shift from the first movie and not as fast paced, it is more accurate and faithful to the source material than the Fellowship of the Ring's film adaptation, and the Two Towers definitely introduces deeper and more important chemistry between characters, so while Peter Jackson's first two Lord of the Rings movies are different in some ways, I believe that the Two Towers matches and maybe even exceeds the already near-flawless Fellowship of the Ring."
No Name,5,"The first film sets up the world of Middle Earth, but the second film in the trilogy sets up higher stakes. Somehow you think it‚Äôs near impossible to top yourself on a visual spectacle, but Peter Jackson (Director) clearly got comfortable and ready to escalate. This film has one of the best battle sequences of all time in cinema. The scope is even bigger and the story just expands to new dimensions through new and old characters. Gollum is a CGI masterpiece and has more depth than a normal human character would possess. Once again Middle Earth surpasses expectations."
No Name,5,"That's not a just a movie, that's a timeless piece of art."

No Name,5,94%. 2/24/23: Amazing film. Different from the first one where the group is split up into smaller groups for basically the whole film. Gollum is leading Frodo and Sam to Mordor. Some more people come together for the last battle. This one is really about Saruman trying to take over a fortress of men.
No Name,5,This is one of the greatest sequels I've ever seen. I thought the fighting scenes in this movie were epic. Great film.
No Name,5,Amazing and very nice movie.
No Name,4,Una gran continuaci√≥n para una de las mejores sagas de todos los tiempos
No Name,5,"The sequel show us how powerful the tentation of the ""benefits"" of the evil can be, with the best way ever to show how important the question is and bringing a perspective of the inocents who can be so much more than we ever expected, the soundtrack is awesome like the first movie, the story has no fails and the actors are awesome (point to Sir Ian McKellen whta a great man!)"
No Name,5,"The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is honestly a brilliant sequel and it's even a masterpiece and a half. The movie's got a brilliant story, which follows on straight after the first movie and it's about Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) arriving to Mordor with the help of Gollum (Andy Serkis).

A number of new allies join their companions team to defend the well known Isengard, while Saruman (Christopher Lee) deploys an assault from his territory.

The cast are all honestly brilliant with their performances throughout this movie and the same goes with their dialogue. All of the characters dialogue which is given throughout this movie is all honestly great and non of their dialogue feels weak at all.

The cinematography which was shot by Andrew Lesnie, who did the first one's cinematography does another brilliant job at capturing the scenes so smooth and so beautifully. He does it so well and he makes the scenes look so amazing.

Also, there's a lot more of the action sequences throughout this movie and they are very clever, very graphic and very unique just like the first ones were and they are all very well choreographed.

The movie's even got such a beautiful soundtrack, the score which was beautifully composed by Howard Leslie Shore OC. He does such a great job with the soundtrack and it goes so well with the scenes they've been placed within this movie.

The movie's even got some brilliant humour, which always hits and it never misses. That's mainly from Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) his character adds some really funny humour throughout this movie, which adds to his character quite a bit.

The movie's even got more dark themes (In my opinion), they add a lot more to the different locations which we end up discovering throughout this movie and it's done so well, which I really liked.

Finally, the love interest in this movie is very well built up and it doesn't feel rushed at all, it's a very interesting one and I think it works quite a bit.

The pacing which this movie's got is all honestly brilliant and all of the moments are all built up very well and non of those scenes fail in any sort of way because they are all built up brilliantly.

The orcs throughout this movie have got more of a darker and more of a graphic look to them, which I think added a bit more of a disturbing look to them, which I really liked.

Overall, Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is honestly a brilliant sequel. The movie's got a brilliant story, brilliant performances, great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, clever action sequences, brilliant pacing, a beautiful soundtrack, brilliant humour, dark themes, more disturbing looking orcs and an interesting love interest.

I'd honestly recommend this movie, if you enjoyed the first one and if you're into fantasy/action movie's. I think this movie is honestly worth the watch and you'll probably enjoy it as much as the first one."
No Name,5,"A brilliant middle chapter of an incredible trilogy, combined with Jackson's direction, the script he co-wrote with Walsh, Boyens and Sinclair, the performances of the cast, Shore's score, Lesnie's cinematography, Horton's editing, Major's production design, Hennah and Lee's set decoration, Dickson and Taylor's costume design, action sequences, sound design and visual effects, The Two Towers interlopes through three storylines incredibly effective and makes a beautiful and entertaining film!!!"
No Name,5,An amazing movie one of the best of all time.
No Name,4.5,"This is a wonderful film. The entire Helm's Deep sequence is incredibly impressive visually, on the level of Mad Max: Fury Road. The special effects are really well done for a 2002 movie, and the score is absolutely flawless. My favorite part of this film is the anticipation that builds for the battle at Helm's Deep; it really feels like the whole story is leading to that scene. My only complaints are that things feel a little rushed (and as a disclaimer, I watched the theatrical version, not the extended edition). Character motivations are often lacking, so a lot choices don't always make sense and character's seem to do this just for the sake of advancing the plot. Similarly, the character development all felt a bit rushed, especially compared to the wonderfully rich development found in the novel version. But overall, these are minor criticisms. This movie is still incredible."
No Name,4.5,Just as good as the original.
No Name,4.5,An epic middle chapter to an epic trilogy.
No Name,5,Just as good as Fellowship. Unparalleled in the fantasy genre.
No Name,5,The start of a great journey
No Name,0.5,So freaking rubbish the movie is so horrible and it  has bad action
No Name,5,"A+
10/10
..........."
No Name,5,"Fillef with action, this middle segment of tbe original trilogy is one the best movies ever made."
No Name,5,"I absolutely loved this film and I love Lord of the Rings so much. I love that they put Gollum on the front row and some of my all-time favorite scenes are the scenes with Gollum. I love that this takes place right after fellowship it really feels more like a journey. I can't get enough of the amazing score its just so good. Some say this is the most perfect trilogy and I see why it is literally perfect. I love the makeup and prosthetics it is so good and the orcs look disgusting because of that and I love every single second of it I'm glad they didn't use motion capture suits for the orcs as the Hobbit did. These films are an achievement in storytelling in keeping a whole journey and feeling like your really there and connected with them over three years. I can't get enough of the absolutely amazing worldbuilding it is literally amazing and nothing else can top it at all. Peter Jackson really did something amazing with this film that I don't think can be done again and if anyone else would have made this it would be so different and it would probably be worse. I'm so excited to see Andy Serkis as Alfred in The Batman he is such a good actor and needs an oscar nomination by now. I'm glad that they only do one thing that really is CGI throughout the entire movie and that is Gollum which I love and I love the practical effects and not the CGI and green screen. This film has so many iconic things like the lines and everything about it is iconic from the characters to the score its all amazing. They try to humanize which Gollum which I didn't think they would have but I love that they showed him in human form and Andy Serkis did an amazing job outside the motion capture suit which gets me more excited for The Batman. This film has some of my all-time favorite lines as does the whole trilogy. Smeagol is one of my all-time favorite film characters and he is so iconic. There are so many amazing grand-scale shots that show off the grand-scale of New Zealand and they all look beautiful mixed with the film they shot on makes it look amazing and adding the score to that makes it some of the best shots of all time. I love the buildup for the battle of helms deep and it is one of my all-time favorite battles. This film again has one of the biggest cliffhangers of all time and I wish one of the companies would come out with the 9 hour and 30-minute version of it I would watch that so much.

Like the last one they don't use sfx only but one time and that is for Gollum which the sfx really holds up for all of the sfx now with endgame and lion king. I really cannot get enough of the amazing score I could listen to it for hours and not get bored it that's how much I love it. Like before the sound mixing and editing are on point with the battle at the end sounding amazing and the elephant looking things too. I love the locations they used it this getting more into Mordor and the color grading making it look like more of Mordor it looks fabulous. The cinematography looks amazing. The script like the last film is amazing and it baffles me that one trilogy can earn 30 nominations/wins it just is outstanding that a film trilogy can do that and if you don't think this trilogy is perfect look at the Oscar love that this got. Like the previous film they develop their characters out so well I just love it and when characters have those heart to heart moments I just love those scenes and those are some of my favorites. The acting is on point and everyone is giving it their all especially Elijah Wood if just like the previous film if there was anything snubbed it was Elijah Wood's acting he actually is a really good actor and I wish he got more major roles after Lord of the Rings but he didn't he could have been a major Hollywood star. The editing mixed with the suspenseful score creates these tense full scenes that I just love. The action scenes really hold up after all these years. Overall I absolutely loved this film and would recommend it to anyone.

No Name,5,"Pure Art!Incredibly epic and remarkably amazing movie!the journey of fellowship's the 3,4 different situation's story-lines with the goosebumps and epic end it was the great experience!the return of Gandalf was satisfying as hell,the Rohan's war build-up and the ring's quest with Gollum and the tree's thing with two hobbits it was awesome,the army of Sauron and Saruman and there fights with two kingdoms and the story connecting major things it was brilliant,the ending war is literally a piece of art the losing hope of men's and the incredible turn with the satisfying scenery and music and the Actions scenes with Awesome CGI it was literally the greatest experience,the whole movie is a treat its a greatest sequel,A pure art,A Masterpiece!"
No Name,3,The best of the 3 thanks to an exciting final battle and cliffhanger ending.
No Name,4.5,"The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is an epic sequel that gives us great and interesting characters, effects that still hold up, a beautiful score, a beautiful look, and epic action but it can suffer from some mood killers and jarring editing. Rating: A-"
No Name,4.5,"The second film does a better job at telling the story, but is a bit less impressive in terms of CGI and visuals. Still an epic masterpiece overall."
No Name,5,Great sequel! The fighting scenes in this movie were epic.
No Name,5,"A nearly flawless fantasy epic that is capped by the iconic, genre defining Battle of Helms Deep."
No Name,4,really enjoyed this one first film is a bit better but that just nick picks overhaul a outstanding movie a must watch
No Name,5,"Lord of the rings - my absolute all time ever favourite films. Seen all 3 probably 100,000 times. Love love love them"
No Name,5,Incredible. Phenomenal in every way. I cannot say enough good things about these films.
No Name,4,"My son thinks in The Lord of the Rings trilogy that this is his favorite. Mine is the Return of the King. It's a great middle to a long journey by Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, and Aragon. It has many instances we're old alliances come to bear, old alliances jump in at last second to help the situation, no spoiler alerts here. Whether you're a fan of the first, second or third installment it's a long exciting Adventure. This successfully next the fellowship to Return of the King nicely"
No Name,4.5,One of the BEST movies I've seen! This movie really depicted Lord of the Rings story very well. This movie was amazing and I really enjoyed watching it! There's a lot of battle violence/action but that's the most excitment in the movie. The Helms Deep battle was epic and awesome to watch! This may be one of the best fantasy movies I've seen! I give this 92% Rotten Tomatoes!
No Name,4.5,"As with the Fellowship of the Ring, this is truly a beautiful and faithful adaptation of the book by Tolkien. The cast is absolutely perfect and the shots are stellar. The battle of Helm's Deep is captivating and you will find yourself holding your breath as you vicariously feel the dismay of the people being besieged. Another masterpiece by Jackson."
No Name,5,The Two Towers follows up Fellowship of the Ring and somehow manages to excel it. All the characters are well-rounded and extremely likeable and the plot keeps the audience intrigued all the time. It also introduces many new characters but never feels like anybody is being sidelined. Golem is extremely interesting and there is a lot of really nice tension with the threat of Sauron . The massive battle at the end of the film is expertly shot and keeps you on the edge of your seat - this film is a must see!
No Name,5,"A classic of our times, you must watch and re-watch it 2/3"
No Name,4.5,"The second film in this great cinema trilogy, takes everything it did from its predecessor and multiplies it, bringing twists and turns and a more satisfying direction to the plot."
No Name,5,"Retoma y contin√∫a la historia en la Tierra Media de forma espectacular. Con una mezcla de acci√≥n y la narraci√≥n de la historia deja cautivado al espectador, al punto de ansiar el final de la trilog√≠a. Se mantiene e incorpora un reparto excepcional y efectos especiales a la altura de la saga."
No Name,5,"In my opinion the worst out of the Lord Of The Rings franchise but still a masterpiece, no real flaws, only that a few scenes maybe will feel boring to some viewers, but not really that big of a deal a brilliant movie with one of the best battle sequences of all time."
No Name,5,"Despite not being the best adaptation, The Two Towers work as an amazing second act to the saga that changed fiction forever. In terms of loyalty to source material, this may not be the perfect movie, but it does a fantastic job at fulfilling its purpose: continuing the epic journey started in its predecessor and preparing its audience for the grand finale, without feeling as an empty filler."
No Name,5,This film set new highs for big battles in blockbuster films
No Name,5,Perfect middle movie to the best trilogy of all time. If you haven't seen the extended version. I highly recommend it for all three movies.
No Name,5,spectacular film that leaves you breathless for the third chapter
No Name,5,"I remember watching this film at 11 years old during the first night of its theatrical release. My father took me and my older brother to the Cinemark in Atlanta, GA to check it out after being turned away from several sold out shows. As a child, I remember the vivid images, the stunning photography, and the unforgettable cinematography that easily jumped off of the screen and burned itself into my memory. It was one of the most unforgettable film going experiences I've ever had. 

As an adult, my viewpoint has not changed. From its breathtaking score, to its incredible plotline, to Peter Jackson's incredibly detailed approach to complex character development, this is by far one of the greatest action epics of our time. 

Though Return of the King is fantastic, this insertion is easily the best of the trilogy."
No Name,5,"THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME, AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE OF CINEMA, MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME"
No Name,4,Critics were right. This was better than the first. Thought it would be too geeky but I loved it.
No Name,4,This is my least favorite of the three mostly because the middle is slow but its still a good movie overall
No Name,5,"It ups the ante by balancing an emotional story with exciting action sequences, impressive special effects and compelling characters, that leaves you with a lot of hype for the next film."
No Name,5,how can you not like this?
No Name,5,The sequel in this masterful trilogy is an emotionally driven action film that has some of the finest pacing for its lengthy runtime. The stunning look along with the final act grows even more tension for the long awaited conclusion.
No Name,4.5,Great movie. At times can be slow. Overall great!
No Name,5,This is a Masterpiece of a Fantasy World
No Name,5,"Excellent movie of all time in fantasy movie genre. I also do recommend expanded version, as it obviously contains pretty cool scenes, among which is a scene where Saruman falls from the top of Isengard."
No Name,5,"Love it with all of my heart, even though I think it's my least favorite of the trilogy, although that doesn't change a single thing."
No Name,5,The Two Towers continues the Lord of the Rings franchise with well created characters and amazing battle scenes.
No Name,3,sdfsdfsdfsdsdfsfsfsdff
No Name,5,Loved the battle scenes!
No Name,4.5,"Sometimes overlooked between the well-paced introduction and the exciting finale, The Two Towers has just as much of Jackson's expertly crafted adaptation as any of the other entries in the series. (4.5/5)"
No Name,3,"too long and has too many plotlines, bot it was good"
No Name,5,Very fun fantasy sequel!!!
No Name,5,Absolutely enchanting. A must watch classic.
No Name,5,Absolute masterpiece! This is my favorite of the trilogy. An awesome battle at the end. It perfectly sets up The Return of the King.
No Name,5,This movie is perfect
No Name,3,"Now dont get me wrong I do like The Two Towers, it has some of the darkest tone in the saga however the movie itself can drag on for too long in certain scenes and is always faking out death scenes. I would be lying though if I didnt say this middle installment in the lord of the rings did not have possibly the best fight scenes in the franchise especially The Battle of Helms Deep."
No Name,5,My favourite one of the series!
No Name,5,Best out of all of them!
No Name,5,"Fate would have it that The Two Towers is the quintessential post 911 allegory; faceless world altering evil being stood up to my the united grieving good of the little person. When Gandalf or Sam or Merry or Faramir speaks they're speaking using Tolkien's words through time and talking directly to us. Undoubtedly the success of this and the other Rings movies are that they are lovingly and reverently adapted by teams of indie creatives at the height of their passion and the tops of their game. However, it's enduring legacy and legendary status owes itself to the fact that The Two Towers had, and still has, a reason to exist in the world. It speaks to what fantasy was made for and it bolsters the human spirit and champions hope and understanding, forgiveness and love.


There's a sensitivity here not usually applied to middle films in a trilogy but making the groundbreaking meld of CGI and characterisation of Sm√©agol/Gollum the central arc of the story is very smart. It gives the film thrust and purposeful connective tissue to Return of the King. His arc from Gollum to Sm√©agol and to Gollum again is sad, important and due to Andy Serkis also hilarious. It does everything a middle film should, introduces new characters, fleshes out old and builds tension to the third film. The battles are bigger but no less well crafted and every side story is a worthwhile one. 

The extended version is a difficult bag, all the scenes removed are extraneous certainly, but are all brilliant moments and in any other film, indispensable. Boromir and Faramir scenes manage to actually give more relatability to a character that's already dead and the funeral of Th√©oden's son is incredibly sad, poignant and pertinent."
No Name,5,Better than the first
No Name,5,"The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen. But then there's so much more than that‚Äîthis movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum, dramatic political tension in Rohan, and fantastic moments with the Ents. This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy."
No Name,4.5,"When a film improves and magnifies his astonishing predecessor, it is meant to be not only a good sequel, but a remarkable and historical trilogy, that is what ‚ÄòThe two towers' has made."
No Name,5,"The middle chapter in the adaptation of the greatest fantasy series of the 20th century (perhaps ever). This contains everything from intimate moments of friendship to battles of terrifying scale. It may be slightly less great than the first or third, but it's still a masterpiece. Every moviegoer should give this film a chance."
No Name,4.5,"The first hour, Awesome, the second hour, Decent, the third hour, perfection!
Better than the first!
9,5/10"
No Name,5,"Perfection. Way too much time taken away from the big battle scenes for Frodo‚Äôs story, but still 5 stars because I understand he‚Äôs a big part of the story. Just get bored during his scenes and it‚Äôs a long movie."
No Name,5,It's great! Because it's even better than The Fellowship of the Ring.
No Name,5,"Spectacularly directed by Peter Jackson, written fantastically by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair and Jackson, with amazing special effects, innovative makeup, electrifying action scenes, memorable soundtrack by Howard Shore, beautiful cinematography by Andrew Lesnie, detailed costumes and captivating performances by Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Bernard Hill, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, David Wenham, Brad Dourif, Karl Urban, Sean Bean and Andy Serkis, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers achieves the difficult feat of overcoming its predecessor and being, like it, one of the best fantasy films of all time"
No Name,5,Blew me away. This trilogy is a must see
No Name,4.5,Fantastic movie that sets up the final chapter of the LotR trilogy quite nicely.
No Name,4.5,A classical tale that few should miss out on
