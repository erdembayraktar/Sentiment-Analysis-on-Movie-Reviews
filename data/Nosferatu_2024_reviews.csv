Name,Rating,Review
Jared,4,Excellent Cinematography and a great soundtrack set the dreary mood of this movie. The characters portrayed a sense of dread and despair that was quite convincing as a viewer.
Bryan P,3,Disjointed. Glitches in storyline.
No Name,5,"El romance g√≥tico y las historias no estaban en mi entendimiento, y Nosferatu me emergi√≥ en la historia de amor que se explica de una manera perturbadora y bella. Muestra que no siempre el romance es hermoso, puede ser obsesivo y tr√°gico, esta pel√≠cula explica perfectamente esa idea, no es lenta y en el transcurso deja clara cada idea. Una m√°ster class de imagen, audio e interpretaci√≥n."
No Name,4.5,"Wow, what a movie! Eggers crushes this one and makes the 2h+ time commitment a heck of a ride that's well worth it. The casting choices made sense and the plot/storytelling lured you in right away.

From a technical standpoint - production design, photography, makeup & costume design, this team puts on a breathtaking masterpiece that's both terrifying and stunning to look at. 

We can stop making vampire movies, this one's execution would be very difficult to surpass. Well done, Nosferatu team!"
Vixen,5,"Absolutely wonderful, perfect amount of jump scares, but more importantly captured a ton of the true elements of the Nosferatu"
No Name,0.5,"I anticipated the movie to be a true horror movie, during the movie I found myself as well as other people laughing at certain scenes. Despite the vulgar scenes and story lines I am sad to say I rated this movie a 4/10. Although the characters were great the story was a miss."
Chris J,2,"Molasses slow retelling of the original Nosferatu. Neither engaging or scary... atmospheric, yes. Very darkly lit. The count is menacing but not scary. Completely anticlimactic end. Willem Dafoe is a favorite actor but he took me out of the film. His wig was poor and his style of acting necessitates others around him are in the same space. They were not. 
Just really droll and unnecessary."
No Name,5,The best adaptation of Nosferatu. Cant wait for the 4K Extended Cut Steelbook
No Name,1,"It‚Äôs a well made movie, but just not good. The dialog is overdone, too many story lines, and just a very very slow movie."
No Name,1,"I have to say that I thought it was essentially a re-newed version if Bram Stoker's film Dracula, the similarities are almost too many. I preferred that to this. Sorry, not my cup of tea at all. üòí"
Bunnie,4,Much different filming format than other previous vampire movies but definitely worthy of all the praises it's been receiving.
No Name,4,"As a fan of the horror genre, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie take on the beloved origin story. The movie was well-written and the cast was amazing a worthy watch for horror fans."
No Name,5,If you like the classic Hammer horror films you will love this. If you don‚Äôt you probably won‚Äôt like it. One of the best horror movies I have seen in a while.
No Name,5,"I loved this movie from start to finish, amazing work from everyone that worked in it.  From the effects, the designs of the clothes, the acting to the pacing of the story everything was tailored and curated in the best way! One of the best film I saw in the last year!"
No Name,2,Bill was average. Could have saved heaps by having his brother Gustav play the role. So many desperate to talk this movie up for some reason. It's not visually incredible but is an overacting masterpiece if that's your thing. Ps Depps daughter has weirdly large nipples
Noah B,4,Visually fantastic. Great performances. I thought the writing didnt match the rest but overall such a great movie.
No Name,1,Do not believe these reviews. This move has no plot no story nothing at all. Trash movie prob was the worst move i watched in theaters.
No Name,1,Second most boring movie I have ever seen. They should provide night vision goggles just to see what's happening. Dialogue was beyond terrible. The only redeemable element was costuming. Walk don't run.
Karen g,0.5,"So disappointed! Put it this way i didn't even finish it. I walked out before it even ended ughhh good thing went on the cheap day. Like get on with it I wanted moreeeeeeee, this was just ughhhhhh no no no"
Nicholas,0.5,too long to introduce william dafoe character. The movie was too long to get to point. Not a good picture.
Mary,4,Stunning cinematography. Plot a bit slow
No Name,5,"Hacer una recreaci√≥n de una joya de culto como Nosferatu es un tema de discusi√≥n. Lo cierto es que la elecci√≥n de Robert Eggers como director fue la m√°s correcta porque √©l conoc√≠a la pel√≠cula original y porque si el proyecto hubiese estado a cargo de otro director, el resultado final podr√≠a no haber sido tan agradable. Cuando Werner Herzog hizo su versi√≥n de Nosferatu, copio varias cosas evidentes de la pel√≠cula de Murnau, pero tambi√©n le dio un toque propio y algunas ideas nuevas para que Nosferatu (1979) fuera una aceptable recreaci√≥n del cl√°sico de Murnau. Con la versi√≥n de Robert Eggers pasa lo mismo, pero llevado a un nivel m√°s alto. Aqu√≠ Eggers no copia al 100% la pel√≠cula original, pero narra la misma historia con un toque propio y cambios que le dan a esta versi√≥n un argumento m√°s desarrollado y profundo adentramiento al mismo. Como es caracter√≠stico del estilo del director, esta pel√≠cula ofrece una visi√≥n bastante sombr√≠a y con un ritmo lleno de bastante tensi√≥n. Al igual que The Witch y The Lighthouse, la direcci√≥n de Eggers hace que esta pel√≠cula se sienta como una pesadilla. Hay momentos en que la influencia del Conde Orlock afecta mentalmente a los personajes al punto de que sienten que est√°n atrapados en una pesadilla de la que no pueden despertar. Hay momentos en los que parece que la realidad se distorsiona y genera una sensaci√≥n de tensi√≥n en el ambiente. Thomas Hutter ya se est√° adentrando en una pesadilla y no es hasta que conoce al Conde Orlok que comienza a sospechas bastante. En la pel√≠cula de Murnau, Thomas se mostraba esc√©ptico hasta descubrir lo que Orlok era realmente. En la versi√≥n de Herzog, √©l ya sospechaba del conde al momento de conocerlo y en esta pel√≠cula pasa eso tambi√©n, pero con m√°s intensidad. El control que Orlok tiene sobre Ellen es bastante perturbador y es manifestado como algo similar a una posesi√≥n demoniaca. El romanticismo que la pel√≠cula ofrece sobre Ellen y Orlok parece en parte basarse en lo que Coppola hizo con Dr√°cula, pero la relaci√≥n entre ellos en esta pel√≠cula es mucho m√°s oscura. El Conde Orlok de Bill Skarsgard es mucho m√°s sombr√≠o y siniestro que su contraparte original. Pasa mayor parte del tiempo en las sombras y eso lo hace ver mucho m√°s misterioso y t√©trico. El vampiro creado por Murnau se basaba m√°s en los Strigoi que eran vampiros mucho m√°s horripilantes que un vampiro humano com√∫n. En ese momento, le dieron una apariencia m√°s similar a un roedor por su v√≠nculo con la peste bub√≥nica. El Conde Orlok de esta pel√≠cula sigue el mismo par√°metro, pero con un dise√±o mucho m√°s grotesco y demacrado. Aqu√≠ Orlok es un vampiro m√°s cadav√©rico y se siente como un aut√©ntico no-muerto que lleva siglos demacr√°ndose. Tambi√©n pudieron dar una breve explicaci√≥n de c√≥mo Orlok se convirti√≥ en un no-muerto. El maquillaje es excelente y pudieron brindar una macabra versi√≥n del vampiro nosferatu en su m√°ximo esplendor. El bigote fue sacado de la novela de Bram Stoker, ya que en ese libro la descripci√≥n de Dr√°cula incluye un bigote y es un detalle que muy pocas veces se ha usado. Aqu√≠ logro pegar junto con la vestimenta que pone en evidencia la antig√ºedad de la criatura. Robert Eggers logro agregar m√°s desarrollo a los personajes superando lo que Murnau y Herzog hab√≠an hecho. La √∫nica diferencia ser√≠a Orlok que en la versi√≥n de Herzog es m√°s humano y melanc√≥lico. As√≠ como Herzog ha ofrecido nuevos momentos memorables para sentirse como una pel√≠cula original, Robert Eggers hace lo mismo. Existen muy buenos planos con maravillosa fotograf√≠a, estupendo vestuario, buen dise√±o de producci√≥n y el correcto uso de luz y sombra. Hay escenas que recuerdan un poco al estilo de Tim Burton. La pel√≠cula se convierte en una obra g√≥tica con escenas perturbadoras, es bastante po√©tica y aterradora. Robert Eggers supo renovar este cl√°sico tan querido y hacer una pel√≠cula que est√° a la altura de la original. Al igual que sus predecesoras, esta pel√≠cula est√° destinada a ser un cl√°sico. Nosferatu (2024) es una bella pel√≠cula art√≠stica, un cuento g√≥tico que revive el arte del vampirismo en el cine y una digna sucesora de la obra de Murnau. Una prueba irrefutable de que Nosferatu logr√≥ seguir perdurando en el tiempo, a pesar de haber pasado 100 a√±os. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 10/10."
Louis,5,One of the best movies Ive seen in years. The acting is fantastic. Nosferatus voice is perfection.
No Name,3,Not enough bats for me
No Name,2,Boring till the last 3rd of movie. Kinda corny.
No Name,5,"I imagine many a Hollywood Veteran Director/Producer are Green with Evey towards Mr. Roger Eggers, in the same way Hollywood H8s Jim Cameron.....since Egger's Films rival many & more of the Flopbuster & indeed Blockbusters of the 20's

Oh & Nosferatu is Great, it goes without saying. A must-see in the Theaters gt me to go back to The Movies, I can tell you that. )"
Adam,0.5,Not worth the money or time. Twilight knock off. Expected horror being as the original vampire.  More of a sappy love story‚Ä¶ should have streamed instead. Save your money
Nichole P,4,Faired well to the original 1922. Just a bit much on the sex and nudity. Overall it was great.
No Name,2,"I was very disappointed. I found it kind of funny, kind of boring. No chills for me."
Matthew,3.5,Definitely the best modern interpretation of the Dracula mythos. The first half will have you remembering your first read of Dracula. the back half is kind of wonky but we'll shot and acted thru and thru
H Alan R,2.5,Interesting but very slow.  Didn‚Äôt live up to the hype though
No Name,5,"I Love it, it‚Äôs a incredible movie with outstanding cinematography and visuals and score and terrific performances by the entire cast specially by Deep And Skarsg√•rd and of course the amazing and unique direction by Eggers."
Thierry,2,Not a great version of a well known story with a lack of unexpected turns
Virginia B,1.5,"The screenplay didn‚Äôt build the characters enough, because I cared about no one. Seemed more focused on demon possession, than vampirism. There were a couple of hopeful moments, but not enough for me to want to recommend it even on streaming."
Andre V,5,THANK YOU FOR THIS CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE MR EGGERS !
walla,3.5,"solid cinematography its disgustingly horrifying a bit sexual , a different take on an age old story"
bj,3.5,A little long. Too much nudity. Amazing cinematic artistry!
No Name,2,This director is always a visionary.. but the acting (with exception of Nicholas hoult and a few others) is almost to the point of soap opera. I‚Äôm a huge fan of ‚Äúthe light house‚Äù but this was not worth the watch and length of time.
Garrett,4,It was a pretty good remake. it is definitely worth the watch.
No Name,0.5,"Huge vampire fan. Read everything and watched everything imagineable but my gosh was this movie horrendous. Terrible script, jumped around and made zero sense. Lily was a very poor actress and bills accent for this movie was all over the place and at times I missed what he was even saying. Aaron Taylor Johnsons acting was the only saving grace for this movie. The scene setting was abysmal how you can have a movie last as long at this one and it be poor at setting scenes is ridiculous, nothing makes you care about any character in this movie. Saw a few people leave the cinema at different points which I've never experienced before but came as little surprise. I was glad when it was over."
James B T,5,A little bit slow in the middle but great ending  would have liked to see more of Nosferatu full gore
Joe,5,Excellent  .... Done right
No Name,1.5,"Meh, wait for cable, had high expectations but not delivered."
No Name,2,"I thought that was more frighting and scary, but instead it was more awkward, I expected a scary movie not this"
Jeffery,5,Great atmospheric movie. Count Orloc is gruesome as ever.
Mary,3,Same standard Dracula story with different names for the characters.
Maria y Juan G,5,"just so good, we loved every minute of it"
No Name,3,"Visually stylish, but a movie you‚Äôll either love or think is severely overrated. If you are not the biggest fan of Eggers work, you‚Äôll think the ladder"
No Name,1,"The scariest part for me was that it almost bored me to death. And that ending... who came up with that? Seriously. Can't recommend it. Which is really sad because I had high hopes for it. Don't get me wrong - I loved the original, liked a lot of the pictures but all in all the story was extremly slow and it was VERY HARD for me to stay awake most of the time.. :-("
No Name,1.5,"Super boring. They forgot the plot. Copy/paste of bram stoker Dracula, which was also boring. Nice cinematography. Dialog seems contrived, and that‚Äôs coming from someone who enjoyed The Witch. I think Eggers needs to go back to low budget, this felt like an ultra produced nothing burger."
No Name,3,Poor script. The story jumps around too much for its own good. Visually astounding
John,5,Loved the plot and cinematography best Vampire movie I think I‚Äôve ever seen
Alexander S,5,"Second row IMAX put me in the movie and it was a great telling of the tale. Eggers really delivers a sort of descent that relies on rich sensory experiences and no horror gimmicks.  See this in IMAX, as close as you can stand, so that the image and sound overwhelm.  When Count Orlock looms above you, youll understand"
Brianna,5,This was a masterpiece had us hooked through the whole thing
No Name,1,It's very rare that we walk out of a movie. We weren't the only ones either. With a stellar cast I'd expecting something really good. It was just a poor Hammer house of horror type movie. Visuals similar to some of those on the dracula movie with Val Kilmer. Shame really as it had potential
No Name,3,Very stylish and engaging version of the classic Dracula story but rather plodding at times.
Alex,4,Visually stunning in true Robert Eggers fashion.  Stellar acting performances all around.  It was a little longer than it needed to be but an overall great movie.
Ronald,1,"Poor script, story jumped around to much. To dark I assume to hide the poor stage props. ""Dark Shadows"" was done better than this movie"
Boyle M,2.5,Movie was silly. Visually great. Just another Robert Eggers movie.
Jarell W,3.5,"Adequate remake of a film from the 1920s. I am a lover of vampire movies, so the bias probably added an extra star. The tone and atmosphere were outstanding, yet the plot was problematic when focusing on the character Thomas Hutter (Nicolas Hoult), who seemed to make the worse decisions imaginable. Although I guess his idiocy was necessary to drive the plot forward. Overall the movie was worth seeing, but isn‚Äôt something I will revisit often."
No Name,0.5,Terrible watch. Needs to be rated at least MA15+ for the gore. While the visuals and effects were great they were not met with an ounce of storyline.
No Name,4.5,This movie is simply amazing
No Name,4,pretty swag. vampire looks hella gnarly.
Jasaire,5,"WOWSERS!!! This is in no way like the 1920s version. I love the creativity of the story, realistic graphics and make up. In my opinion, I think this movie is great for Halloween, a spooky Valentine's Day or any day of the year. I will definitely see this movie again."
No Name,3.5,"Another Dracula movie? pshaw..... Nevermind! Upon watching I was actually pleasantly surprised.  This is the only major adaptation that actually does a halfway decent job at recreating the novel. Major props for the sets and atmosphere, takes itself a little too seriously in the acting department sometimes but has a satisfying runtime and resolution. I enjoyed Dafoe a lot in this."
No Name,5,"It was a beautiful movie, every scene was magnificent. I truly loved this film"
Itza,5,"It was a great movie very relaxing to watch and entertaining. 
I recommend it 100%"
Ben W,4,"Visually beautiful. Story was gripping, although the Dracula/vampire story has been told time and time again. Good effects, great acting (other than Aaron Taylor Johnson), excellent visuals and cinematography, etc, etc. Can be slow at times, but I always appreciate a slow burn."
No Name,3.5,"Hauntingly beautiful, and worth it for the visuals alone."
Robyn B,5,"Amazing cinematography, settings, costumes, and overall creepiness!"
No Name,5,"It creeps under your skin. A visually stunning adaptation of 1922 Nosferatu that honours the original whilst introducing new layers to it, making it a complex alluring gothic horror masterpiece."
Keishon,5,Probably one of the best horror films I have ever watched!
slipkid99 L,3,I thought the ending was a bit anticlimactic.
No Name,5,Imax viewing was so intense. Im not a scary movie guy but I love films. I did not have any back story other than knowing what a vampire is and I was on edge the whole film. I dont think Ill ever watch this again.
No Name,1,Way too long. Boring.
No Name,5,"So cinematic and detailed. Love the production , little slow but worth watching"
No Name,4,"I‚Äôve been a fan of the original silent film ever since they played a 16mm print for us in elementary school, during a rained out recess, and it scared the hell out of me. This film is very true to the original but it also fleshes out the story and characters some more."
Peter,4,Great movie just not exactly what we expected
No Name,0.5,"We‚Äôve never walked out of a movie before, but we walked out of this one. It was trying to do something but it was just awful. Not even Willem Defoe could save it. The plot is all over the place, so much so that I‚Äôm not sure there even is one. The characters give you no reason to care about them whatsoever. Didn‚Äôt even enjoy the cinematography of it. Nosferatu is barely in the damn thing.  Long, DULL, and just plain bad. I don‚Äôt know how they made a famous vampire story boring, but they certainly did."
Masha,1,Honestly was very boring.
No Name,4,Well crafted and will definitely be seeing a second time!
Michael,5,Great movie and time spent with my daughter in a comfortable theatre.
No Name,5,A masterpiece. It‚Äôs in my top 3 vampire movies.
Jeffrey Lang,5,This is one of the most absolutely beautiful things I have ever seen. There was not one frame of the film that didn‚Äôt convey the feel and tone of the story.
Greg P,4,Very scary with impending dread layered throughout. Beautifully shot
Jessica,3.5,Great movie. I just know a lot of people wouldnt be able to understand it. Its filled with social commentary but at the heart is a love story and a womans struggle to feel whole. Fantastic acting- the director is incredible.
Kevin K,5,"A perfect film in every way. I wish all movies were made this well, with this level of cinematography, acting, and writing."
No Name,4,"Robert Eggers gives us one of the best cinematic horror atmospheres we've seen in a long time

This may not be the definitive version we'll see of Nosferatu, but it is the most exciting so far. This is due to Robert Eggers' signature gothic style and his way of telling the story, with the notion that the vampire is a terrible and terrifying being, without any other characteristic that differentiates him.

This ancient vampire continues to be terrifying, firstly because its director does not romanticize the character, but rather gives him that disturbing and chilling air, and secondly because Eggers truly understands that Nosferatu does not focus on the supernatural terror of an everlasting creature, but on power. Impeccable, malicious, immaculate and destructive power. A film with incredible work (especially its photography), cinematically it is full of references and amazing details.

Robert Eggers adds a new treasure to his outstanding filmography."
brian h,4,"Great film, beautifully haunting visuals, touched on so many emotions."
No Name,3.5,I enjoyed this even though it was in the main a retelling of ‚ÄúBram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula‚Äù with Keanu Reeves & Gary Oldman.
No Name,0.5,"The only thing i liked was the atmosphere and filming quality and  movement of the camera. 

It was showing the nosferatu toooooo much, he was speaking none stop,the way he was breathing sometimes became like comedy movies. For us it was more comedy than horror ."
Dante,5,The best Bram Stoker adaptation to date! Bravo!
James,1.5,"boring, hard to understand some characters, too dark."
No Name,4.5,Visually stunning. Glad I saw it in theaters
No Name,0.5,I hated this movie. Cannot recommend it to ANYONE. It‚Äôs advertised as a horror movie but there is nothing remotely scary about this except maybe the oversexualisation of the women in this movie. Honestly this felt more like a porn film than a horror movie. I see what they were trying to do with the creepy and sensual vibes but they just did not execute it well at all. Everytime something happens to the female characters in this movie their breasts are out and instead of screaming in pain they‚Äôre moaning in a sensual manner. I have a lot more to say about this movie it was just so bad. However if you go into watching this thinking of it as a comedy it might be a little more bearable to watch.
Thomas,4.5,Great special effects
No Name,5,"One of the best horror movies of all time... Not just that , it's a brilliantly made movie... The language is a little tough to understand but otherwise everything is captivating. A must watch!"
No Name,3,"The visuals and cinematography are very good.  The acting from the cast is all very good apart from Emma Corrin who I thought gave a sub par performance, I don't think she was correctly cast for her role.  I found myself expecting more from the film.  Slightly disappointed but still enjoyed watching it - with the visuals still staying with me the next day."
Kenneth D,4.5,Feels like the definitive Dracula movie (with respect to Gary Oldman). Eggers was the perfect director to bring the book and original movie back to life
Sandra,5,Visually stunning with odes to the 1920s version.
Prayash,5,"The movie was really scary, and it was one of those scary movies where you wanna get up and leave while its happening, and then afterwards youre like woah that was so good!"
Lisa B,5,"dark gritty, true horror film"
No Name,4,Very nice movie.....!!!!
Susan K,4,"I loved that the film hinted back to old Dracula movies, but the Dracula was hard to understand at times.  Otherwise, the acting was great and the cinematography was really cool.  I didn't know what to expect and I really liked the film. It could win awards."
Omarr M,4,"Highy atmospheric, well acted, spectacle, that brings new life to a classic tale.  Spectacular cinematography."
No Name,1,"The plot moves at an unbearably slow pace, and any scary or suspenseful moments are over almost as soon as they begin, leaving no time for real tension to build. The constant, abrupt scene changes make it hard to stay engaged, and the overall experience feels disjointed. While it has some iconic visuals, the lack of flow and weak pacing made it a chore to watch. I found myself struggling to stay awake. This one might only appeal to film history buffs."
No Name,3,"It looks great, has plenty of atmosphere and doesn't drag and I enjoyed Simon McBurney and Eileen Dafoe's performances. But I thought Orlok was ridiculously OTT as a monster which meant I found him humourous rather than scary, and felt rather sorry for ATJ who was poor in a thankless and fairly pointless role."
Christopher G,5,"Very well written, casted, and produced! Enjoyed it"
No Name,4,Gran manera de abordar un tema tan clich√© como lo son los vampiros
Jacob,5,I liked the scary guy he was scary to me
No Name,4,"A rea√ß√£o de abrir um sorriso ao reconhecer refer√™ncias de diretores que tu admiras influenciando o trabalho de outro dos grandes. A experi√™ncia com a vers√£o de Nosferatu de Robert Eggers √© de sorver o f√¥lego. Est√£o presentes elementos da est√©tica g√≥tica, desde a arquitetura da cidade e do castelo do vampiro, at√© a tez alva e o figurino da protagonista. Mas, Eggers comp√µe o seu Nosferatu mais pr√≥ximo a dimens√£o de horror, elemento manifesto na vers√£o de 1922 de Murnau, com refer√™ncias a cl√°ssicos do terror como o Exorcista de 1973. O diretor mant√©m muitas das caracter√≠sticas de sua filmografia no longa: a pel√≠cula escura que trabalha a luz a partir do destaque, o feixe luminoso que desenha n√£o apenas uma silhueta √† janela, mas um caminho inevit√°vel √† presen√ßa maligna que ali est√°; a composi√ß√£o c√™nica de navios ao mar revolto, tamb√©m manifestos em O Farol e O homem do Norte; a trilha sonora que encaixa como uma luva, seja para acentuar a sensa√ß√£o de inc√¥modo, seja para antever um jump scare (os quais s√£o bem trabalhados e entram bem na narrativa). Lilly Rose Deep est√° muito bem no papel de Ellen. Confesso que logo que vi o an√∫ncio da vers√£o de Nosferatu do Eggers imaginei que Anya Taylor Joy ficaria com o papel, mas Lilly conseguiu equilibrar abje√ß√£o, horror e desejo na constru√ß√£o psicol√≥gica de sua personagem. Bill Skarsg√•rd para al√©m do Conde Orlock, interpreta o puro mal e o assombro que provoca n√£o √© marcado apenas nos momentos em que o monstro aparece (ali√°s, belo trabalho de maquiagem), mas sua presen√ßa maligna √© representada ainda que em sua aus√™ncia. 
Pelo inc√¥modo, est√©tica e intranspon√≠vel assombro nessa vers√£o, Nosferatu do Eggers conquistou meu cora√ß√£o. A compara√ß√£o com o cl√°ssico do Murnau √© inevit√°vel, mas precisa ser localizada no per√≠odo hist√≥rico. Murnau √© expressionismo alem√£o, uma outra constru√ß√£o de plano. Na contemporaneidade, a compara√ß√£o √© desproporcional."
No Name,3,"Tries to be supremely sinister and tragic and doesn't quite manage it. Lovely acting, nice scenery and tone but it doesn't come together. Too many elements murk it up. Borrows extensively from the Gary Oldman one. Seems like it's going to be clever and a bit weird, but is just a big movie dressed up in gothic tones."
No Name,5,"A spectacularly well-made film that I wanted to see again right away after leaving the cinema because I was so distracted by the beauty of each and every shot, I find it difficult to recall the core content and any one particular part of the film.  This film could easily be edited as a silent movie as the soundtrack is also absolute perfection.  The acting has been criticized but I honestly believe there was a need for overacting due to the ambiance and as a further homage to the original film, no single actor stole the show as the star of this film is the film itself.
Incredible set design and costumes, I can almost guarantee that this film will win at least two Oscars, maybe it'll end up with five or six."
PortRow,3,"Very stylish and the acting is very good, if occasionally a little over the top. The dialogue that Count Orlok has is overly florid (its a choice to emphasize his being from another time but it bordered on reading silly (he speaks Romanian with subtitles) and the direction tends to telegraph when you are going to be jump-scared‚Äîand almost all of the horror is the show build up to a jump-scare or occasionally some gore. Im glad I saw it but doubt I will be watching it when its streaming or on tv."
Thomas E,5,"Very good take on an often told story. The leads were all excellent with the exception of one who has given up acting to play himself, over and over again."
No Name,2,"Filme ruim mas muito bem feito.

Os primeiros 30 minutos prometem muito mas quanto mais o tempo passa, o filme se torna quase uma com√©dia.

Apesar de ser lindo visualmente e dos atores entregarem muito, a hist√≥ria √© sem p√© nem cabe√ßa e ao decorrer do filme voc√™ se questiona se est√° captando o sentido ou se de fato, n√£o h√° nenhum.

Al√©m disso, o que mais me irritou foi a quantidade de momentos com conota√ß√£o sexual sem necessidade. O filme, em algum momento, passa a ser uma s√©rie de abusos das mulheres protagonistas.

Por fim, √© um daqueles filmes pra assistir quando der ""na telha"" e quando sair no streaming. N√£o vale a pena ir ao cinema por ele."
Roger L,5,"Great lighting in film.   Good story.  Very scary and icky parts  
Enjoyed it overall.    Not a film for grandma   It would scare her lol"
No Name,4,Masterpiece of a remake and another modern classic of Robert Eggers.
karenAnn,4,Liked bram stokers Dracula better but this was good
No Name,4,Nosferatu is haunting beautiful.It is a dark fantasy and gothic masterpiece but only for the niche audiences.
Matt F,1,"Too long and not worth the time. If it was trying to do something better with the Dracula story, I missed it. Didnt like the old movie and I dont like this one."
No Name,1,"I really, really wanted to like this film. I love the original and everything to do with Dracula, and I'm a huge fan of gothic cinema, but this movie was a huge disappointment for me. Some of the acting was very nicely done, and I can appreciate the atmosphere and the cinematography. And in fact, the first 30 minutes had me believing that it was going to be a fantastic movie. However, the longer it went on, the more the plot got extremely murky. The audience in my theater laughed several times at points that were clearly not meant to be funny, and there were so many plot holes. I also found myself really confused and disheartened by what their thesis wanted to be. It seemed like they wanted to say something about sexual assault, but didn't have a clear point. The fact that she ""sacrifices herself"" at the end made me wonder if they knew what message they wanted to get across at all, or if they only wanted to show the bleakness of a woman being assaulted multiple times just for the sake of it. I would say that I would rewatch it to try to figure it out, but I don't think I could subject myself to that again. And not to mention the HORRIBLE mustache. He looked like Waluigi. Bad all around. Its only saving grace was Willem Dafoe. Without him and his performance, I might even call it unwatchable. I had to rewatch the 1930s Dracula when I got home just to cleanse my pallet."
No Name,4,"El cine expresionista regreso en forma de ficha.

El regreso del joven maestro Roberto eggers en su s√©ptima pelicula dirigida reimaginando la pel√≠cula nosferatu una de las abanderadas adaptaciones del cine expresionista de los 20s. Con una reimaginacion del mito de dracula en el cine. invita a el espectador a abrir la mente a el significado del mito del monstruo maldito, desde un punto esot√©rico/ oculitista. Y de  la  mano de una fotogr√°fica ambiental y un sonido que abraza la idea de llevar a lo m√°s oscuro el mito del relato t√©trico rom√°ntico de dracula de bram stoker. Una pel√≠cula üé• para los amantes del cine que requiere reflexion y paciencia."
No Name,5,Fantastic horror movie
No Name,5,"Great film!!!!!!!! Second best Nosferatu, right after SpongeBob."
Erica,5,10/10 super freaky and loved the male cast üòõ
Devon P,5,"Amazing cinematography, directing, casting, locations, and costuming. Note that although Nasferatu is not a horror movie, it is still extremely visceral in style and not for the weak. 

If you are into film and cinematography like myself, I highly recommend it. It deserves an Academy Award."
Deryk,5,Superb acting. Love that they stuck somewhat to the original movie!
No Name,3,Lovely cinematography but I felt like it was unnecessarily grotesque sometimes.
VM,1,Was really impressed with Lily Rose Depp‚Äôs performance. The movie however was a disappointment.
Srikrishnan R,1,very very boring.  the first movie that I've actually ever walked out on
Justin,4,"Having never seen the original silent movie, I didn‚Äôt know what to think going into this movie. The movie is basically a retelling of the novel ‚ÄúDracula‚Äù by Bram Stoker. For the most part the movie stays true to the source material, while changing a couple things to make it stand on its own. While not terrifying, it‚Äôs definitely grotesque & interesting enough to keep you glued to the screen. I appreciate that you don‚Äôt really see the main antagonist Count Orlok (The Vampire). The actors did such a great job especially Willem Defoe who always shines in whatever role he plays. The one down side I would point out is sometimes the lore is a little hard to follow towards the end. One instance was how they explained how the vampire curse actually works. Other than that this is a solid movie that would recommend seeing in theaters over waiting for it to hit streaming platforms."
Clecio L,2,"Not good
Pretentious"
smith9298,3.5,"Incredible cinematography, skarsgard was creepy but the character was more like a slow speaking old vamp.  Other actors were good and the story was interesting, maybe worth watching at home though."
No Name,0.5,Oh my lord this was the most boring movie I‚Äôve ever seen in my life
Fieldy,5,"Good movie overall, same vibe as Nosferatu 1922"
Joshua,5,"Love me some good Gothic horror, and this one takes the cake for being one of the greatest horror movies of the decade."
No Name,1,"Way too long. Did not earn its genre. More gross than scary and none of the relationships had depth. It was super flat. I wanted to like this so bad but it lacked.

1 star for the cool sets, makeup/costumes & the cats."
Andre,5,"If you love gothic horror and can handle mature adult themes, this is an experience of a lifetime! An absolute masterpiece. I never thought I would see something more iconic than Dracula (1931). This is hands down one of the best works in the history of cinema. A round of applause to everyone involved in making this movie."
Arielle,2.5,I gave it a higher rating because of its originality along with the beautiful filmography but for me it was a super slow burn through the whole film and lacked the horror and excitement I was craving. Recommend to watch at least once.
No Name,3,"Truthfully, it was beautiful in terms of cinematic achievement. The script was similar to that of the original, by that, I mean the scenes and what occurred since the original was silent film. With that being said, it was slow and a bit boring. It was in no means scary as they rave it to be. It was a tad bit creepy and possibly disturbing. The acting was phenomenal, especially Bill as Orlok. His transformation was unbelievable. Lily did a wonderful job as well even though people are making fun of her ‚Äúpossessed‚Äù style of acting where it just looks as if she is gyrating in the style of a seizure. If you want to watch it, go in to it knowing it has the writing style of an old Victorian style film. It can be boring to those that don‚Äôt appreciate this style."
No Name,1,The scariest thing about that movie was how bad it was. If I could rate it a zero I would. I could have gone my whole life without seeing that movie
Vicente,5,"Great movie. Very gothic. Bit of a stretch bringing in all the good vs. evil ethos to a reasonable understanding, but I eventually got it. Warning, it's a period piece so one has to bear with the old English dialog, but it add reality to it. Highly recommend the movie."
Bagel,5,"Great storyline, amazing acting, overall 10/10 experience"
No Name,1.5,"O filme tinha um potencial exuberante mas segundo a avalia√ß√£o da minha equipe o filme se perde no meio do caminho se tornando entedioso e lento,fora as cenas nojentas entre o casal de vampiro e mulher linda,fiquei com d√≥ da loirinha,nota d√≥."
Deborah F,4,Great cinematography and haunting music. Gory with some jump scares.  Kept my attention. Best movie Ive seen in quite awhile.
No Name,1.5,Disappointing. I didn't get to see the ending because i got bored and decided to leave the theather early. Something about it made it seem like an old movie but not in a good way.
Date night movie watcher,1,"Slow to start, cinematography was way too dark, story was just boring with holes that didn't make sense. It was really terrible. We would have walked out but we had dinner reservations we needed to wait for so we stayed to see if it got better. Sadly, it didn't.  The only bright spot was Willem Dafoe who was kind of a comic relief which was off but slightly entertaining."
No Name,5,"Indredible settings and sound design make for a truly unsettling, haunted experience."
No Name,1,Not what I thought it would be. Sound visuals and performance was good but there was something missing that turned this movie into one of the most boring movies I have watched in a while
Kim,5,It was great all around!  Very suspenseful!
No Name,4.5,"Robert Eggers, tomo el cargo de un proyecto con mucha responsabilidad cinematogr√°fica, de un proyecto cl√°sico y de una adaptaci√≥n de la novela ""Dracula"". Lo hizo muy bien y me quedo satisfecho con esta experiencia ""Nosferatu""."
Ronnie C,2.5,stylish but too long and drawn out
Aaron,5,An absolute masterpiece!
Jonathan,5,Brilliant adaptation of Bram Stokers classic. Artistically filmed with stellar performances. One of the best movies all year. Also I believe this to be Skarsgards best performance.
No Name,5,Just a Great film all the way around. Great acting and directing. Classic story.
paul m,4,"Great drama - not as scary or jump-scary as I thought it might be. A very good, dark, drama."
Zinnia G,2.5,I didnt care for all gore. Some of the details were not necessary.
Jaz,0.5,"I did not like this movie at all, neither did my best friend, nor did the woman we met in the bathroom on the way out of the theatre - who said she was also disappointed by the movie. I got a very different idea of what this movie was going to be like before watching it, I thought it would be more of a dark romantic dry comedy with some gore. But it was literally disgusting and offensive to watch, I could not recommend it any less to anyone who has a common decency and nature. So disturbing. To some points, the acting was great (almost too great) and the way they actually filmed the movie was impressive and thoughtful within the scenes. The plotline and the execution of it left much to be desired. The costumes and dialogue was fantastic, but some of the only redeeming qualities of the film."
Christen J,1,"Boring, had very little story line, one of us fell asleep"
Kelsey,1,Horrible!!! I‚Äôd give it negative stars if I could!
Facebook U,2.5,Movie fell flat. Overacted and cheesy dialogue.
No Name,1.5,"I was looking forward to this and wanted to like it, but as I was watching I kept wondering when it would be done. There were parts that felt like a bad acid trip. The story felt disjointed. The scenery, sets, and costumes were lovely. It really did feel like a movie from the 1930s. The character of Ellen was grating and unsympathetic. The movie as a whole was too long and all I felt was relief when it was finally over."
Sandee,2,"Movie was to long, to many story lines and Nosferatu was hard to understand at times. His actual storyline was confusing until the end and the best part was the last scene of the movie."
Maeghan,1,worst piece of hot garbage ive ever watched
No Name,2.5,"The new release of Nosferatu seems a bit dark.  I was looking forward to watching this new release, but,  I prefer the 1979  movie, Nosferatu The Vampyre directed by Werner Herzog"
No Name,4.5,"This film was amazing to watch, I really don't knew it would be so fantastic, Bill Skarsg√•rd did an amazing role as Count Orlok, I definitely could see this film once more."
No Name,2,"I really enjoyed the cinematography and the historical setting, but the storyline was too slow and boring for me."
Emily B,3,"It's beautifully filmed with lots of stark imagery. Unfortunately,  it felt muddled through the middle with some really slow parts."
Rhonda K,3,"Picture was too dark, couldn‚Äôt see what was happening half the time."
No Name,0.5,Felt about as scary as a 1920s horror movie with stupid shadows moving across the screen. Also unnecessarily grotesque. We left the theater wishing we could have that time back.
No Name,0.5,"The theming and set time and place is beautiful and takes your breath away. Sadly, while there were such well accomplished names in this movie, it was a let down. Too much unneeded nude scenes, that did not contribute to the point of the scene, but to shock the viewer. Storyline, was slow in developing, and even though there were moments that lit up the movie, they were quickly diminished but the slow plot. Dafoe did lighten up the movie at multiple points, but there is just soo much he could do. The thing that did annoy me, was the Scandinavian accent of count Orlok, no wonder though, but still, it felt out of place, even if it was haunting to hear."
No Name,3.5,"This movie is all about atmospheric vibes, which I loved. Story was slow and methodical, but I was interested throughout. Ending felt a little abrupt."
No Name,4.5,"Me tom√≥ mucho tiempo, tal vez desde The Lighthouse, poder decir que una pel√≠cula de terror es la mejor experiencia del a√±o. Nosferatu de Robert Eggers es m√°s de lo que esper√© y de lo que podr√≠a esperar del nuevo maestro del cine de terror. Definitivamente, si bien no es perfecta, se acerca a lo mejor de su g√©nero."
Zoli,3,"The acting was largely stilted , the dailogue who-so. 
I enjoyed the cinematography."
No Name,5,"Visually compelling, outstanding score and very good acting!"
No Name,5,"This is easily one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time. I had seen it twice in theaters so far and just can't get over how amazing the scene transitions, acting and just general vibe of the movie. Amazing."
No Name,1,"Would not recommended! I love vampire films but the voice was doing way too much. I found it very distracting and couldn‚Äôt take the film seriously at all because of it. The cinematography was very good but that‚Äôs about it tbh‚Ä¶. 
Had so much potential. Did not meet it"
No Name,1.5,"The visuals are great, and the actors‚Äô talent speak for itself, however the plot of the story ruins the whole experience.
Putting aside the flaws in the storyline, if one wanted to write about this horror movie in a magazine, the title for it would be - Nosferatu, lustful vampire rages in Germany."
No Name,3,Same old storyline and hammy. A few jump scares
Ann O,0.5,"Horrible, horrible horrible"
Pimpollo,5,"Great sound, visuals, performances, costumes. Mostly empty theater."
customer,0.5,"I thought the movie was boring, too loud with the music, and too much nudity and too mucg graphic sex scenes in it. Wasn't what I thought it was going to be."
Joe,3,The setting for the movie was amazing but there was something missing about it. All the actors had great performances but the substance of the plot had a lot to be desired. Bram Stoker's Dracula 1993 2.0.
Devante,0.5,Dreadfully lack luster storyline! I had never walked out on a movie before walking out of this one.
No Name,1,"This flick was so boring we walked out before it was over. Repetitive, unnecessarily gross, seemed to lean on special effects. Dull, don't bother."
Dave,4,"Enjoyed the classic horror and suspense.  It was not gory, but the effects and makeup were astounding.  The wardrobe was beautifully done and I normally don't care about that.  The actors were uterly convincing.  I would have rated it higher but in a nearly empty cinema a guy came in late fell asleep and snored.  Had to wake him up several times."
No Name,4.5,"Compared to the 1922 and 1979 versions, Eggers' version of Nosferatu is scarier and sexier. Arguably the best portrayal of Nosferatu as an undead beast, filled with beautiful yet grim shots that linger throughout the entire film."
Joshua L,4,"Thought provoking film making . I have it 4 stars as its not a film I can invite everyone to see necessarily . I love how gothic and dark the mood is . The primal /sexual tension and expression of emotions is powerful in this film . I neve watched the original Nosferatu , so I was pleased with this films take on the vampires strengths and weaknesses ."
Kristopher F,0.5,"Awful! So, so boring!"
Shandi  C,5,"A beautiful slow burn, dread from beginning to end."
No Name,1,"Sorry, I simply cannot comprehend all the positive reviews and a Tomato Rating of 85%?!!!

Try to imagine a film worse than Nosferatu.  Spoiler alert:  you CAN‚ÄôT!

This is one of the most poorly written, cliche-laden films I have ever seen. It also features several hilarious way over the top performances where actors appear to fake eye rolling seizures *so*ludicrously hammy that people in the audience erupted in laughter several times  (one person even threw paper at the screen!).

The dialogue seems like it was written by 9th - 11th graders with gems like ""a FORCE worse than EVIL!""
""You're a Villain"" and tons of manic, panicked characters running around literally jumping ""to and fro"" yelling ""He's coming! He's coming!""

Truly one of the slowest-moving, most dull plodding films I have ever seen. One can't help but feel bad for the actors. 

This film adds nothing new to the canon (other than a vampire that looks vaguely like a Carpathian version of ‚ÄúFrank Zappa‚Äù.)

Save your money and see any one of the countless better versions of this same story, which most adults have probably already seen at least 7 times.
Oh...and it just kind of ""ends""! (Not that you‚Äôre even paying attention at the end, but just sayin')

You‚Äôll laugh out loud, but sadly, this is not a comedy."
No Name,4,"It's a classic horror film set in the 18th century. 

Hats off to Robert Eggers and the crew; they did a marvellous job with the production. 

While the film runs for a little over two hours, which is quite long, A 1 hour 30 minute film would have been more enjoyable.

I highly recommend horror fans watch it on the big screen."
No Name,5,"This was almost or is a masterpiece. The acting, lighting EVERYTHING was done soooo well! Minus the time traveling/instant transmission I habe no complaints. I wanna watch this again to relive the AMAZING ACTING! THIS IS A MUST WATCH!"
No Name,5,"The type of movie you enjoy if you appreciate Victorian era horror, detailed research of historical accuracy, theatrical acting, and thematic horror rather than jump scares. A wonderful adaptation of THE classic vampire story taking the creature back to its folklore roots. Robert Eggers creates yet another horror masterpiece. If you write a review about Bram Stokers Dracula from Francis Ford Coppola being better than this while citing bad acting as the reason, you need to rewatch and pay closer attention to Keanu Reeves. Every performance in this movie is better than his performance in that movie and I‚Äôm a Reeves fan!"
Brandon E,4,"Despite a long runtime and some pacing issues, Nosferatu is a rich, rewarding horror movie that honors the original film and builds upon that foundation. As expected, Eggers builds an immersive experience for us, and I was impressed by the set design, costume design, and atmosphere throughout the movie. The cast was wonderful and there are some genuinely horrifying moments that were jarring and sudden which was an aspect I really loved about The Witch. Skarsg√•rd and DaFoe were both brilliant. Recommended"
Brian L,1,"The storyline was slow, plodding , and poor.  I thought for the level of actors that they had the acting was actually very deliberate, unimaginative, and inadequate. This is the first movie in over decades of movie watching that I have ever walked out on."
No Name,2,"As soon as I found out about the release of this film, I was expecting something better. Overall, the film is not bad, but I would not recommend watching it and would rather recommend the 1922 film. What I didn't like: 
1. There are a lot of sex scenes and naked bodies, which in general are not needed for this film, I can only single out the scene at the end as a ‚Äúritual‚Äù, but basically this is not needed for the film.2. Not really a minus, but something that I personally don‚Äôt like, it‚Äôs like I watched a big theater show, there‚Äôs no feeling of being in a movie, the actors played well, but it‚Äôs a theater and not a movie3. There are scenes that are worse than in the 1922 film. Perhaps you may consider me wrong in terms of the fact that I compare the original film and this one, but it‚Äôs worth looking at it from the other side, why do I think the 1922 film is better? It's worth thinking about. I won't say specific scenes because it will be too long, but they are there.

Finally, I want to say that this film upset me, I wanted to watch a terrifying film that conveys the spirit of Nosferatu, but I watched something else, it could have been better."
No Name,3,"The visuals and acting were great, but the plot was so similar to Dracula without being Dracula it made it feel predictable, and you didn't really feel like these characters were real people save for the one guy you're apparently supposed to dislike, because the story doesn't flesh them out beyond their architype"
MICHAEL H,1,Overacting.  Sex scenes were unnecessary and in bad taste.  I had hoped for a classic horror story.  Instead of scary it was laughable.  A great cast and  filmed well but poorly executed.  What a shame.
No Name,1.5,The only thing worse than the story was the atrocious acting! Giving it one star for the sheer comedic painfulness.
Bill,4,"Great movie, slow at times."
No Name,1,Overhyped - what a wast of time.‚Ä®It looks amazing but that‚Äôs it.¬†‚Ä®Confused screenwriting and wooden dialogue performed by constantly trembling actors.
No Name,1,Cinematography and costumes were great but it‚Äôs one of the worst movies I‚Äôve ever seen. Sloppy and meandering.
Ron,2.5,"Overall a cool vampire story following the footsteps of the original but it was a bit boring, slow and corny at times. The voice of Count Orloc was distracting and hard to understand at times."
No Name,1,"Slow and very boring. Upset I watched the whole film and didn't leave halfway through

Cinematography and acting by some of the main cast was good, but not enough to make this a worthwhile watch."
Thomas,2,Decent remake of the old silent movie. Might be worth waiting to watch it on TV.
No Name,0.5,The movie was boring
No Name,4,"Classic horror film. Period piece. Great sets, acting, and special effects. 

A bit long, over 2 hours. Could have pulled out 15 to 30 minutes and not missed a beat.

That being said I really enjoyed the movie, and interesting mix of an old classic with modern gore. Nosferatu may have raised the bar on Dracula movies to a new height.

A must see for horror fans."
No Name,1.5,Didn‚Äôt live up to expectations.  Too many disjointed parts. The beast was a nasty piece. Needed more than just a nasty beast though. The heroine was very good. Very disappointing.
mindy d,3.5,Great movie!!!!Just kinda long
No Name,2,"Was one of the few movies I felt like leaving the cinema 

1st hour was so slow, everything happened in the last 30 minutes 

Was nothing that we‚Äôve not seen before when Lee played Dracula"
ammar S,5,very eeri feel to this film with some phenomenal acting as well as cinematography.
No Name,2,"Excellent cinematography and solid performances from most of the actors. Unfortunately not an original take on an old tale and there was a lack of depth to the whole thing,. I think I would have enjoyed it nore if it were less long, but an hour in I found myself bored and looking at my watch."
Ryan Garrison,2,Way too long. And is missing the best parts of the Bram Stokers novel.
No Name,3.5,"The visuals were stunning. The sound effects kept you at the edge of your seat. Orlock's breathing, the way he spoke, the poetic dialogue set the mood perfectly.

The ending however wasn't my favorite. Just because I don't find it believable that Orlock could be so dumb after having been a vampire so long."
Montie B,2,Very few redeeming qualities other than the cast was great but the movie failed to live up to Bram Stokers Dracula although it most likely was never intended to.  It loosely follows Bram Stokers Dracula and once you watch it about the only thing you come away with is understanding why the original was banned for copyright infringement.  The story was similar but the names were changed to protect those guilty of a bad knockoff.
Wyatt,4,"Amazing cinematography and shots, a great story, loved how the characters spoke like they were in the 1800s. Loved the sets, Nosferatu was great, Dafoe was great, superb acting all around. Leaves a little to be desired but still is overall a breath of fresh air and terrific"
No Name,5,"An instant classic. Disturbing, scary, intriguing and a pure cinema experience! Bravo!"
Lalo Preciado,4,It was ok. Could use more explanation
teri,4.5,I know the way it was shot. In the storyline was the same but better and it kept you feeling like you were at a vampire movie. Well done.
Steven G,1,very confusing movie. i didn‚Äôt know what was going on in the movie.
No Name,1.5,The first 45mins of the movie had me invested. Lily Depps 70th seizure had me check out early. Anticlimactic ending and super awkward and forced sex scenes. The entire theatre giggled everytime Ellen started convulsing. Wait for it to hit netflix dont waste your money.
No Name,0.5,"The film is a bad remake of Dracula. If u know the drac story: u will see it here again. They only changed the names of the characters: but it's the exact same drac story step by tedious step. 

I was planning on walking out before the middle of the movie: but I was invited...would have been rude. 

I can't recommend it to no one knowing it's a knockoff of the original story.

The original 1922 film was really scary. 

But this one: 5 thumbs down üëé"
Lucas,5,"A very rare case nowadays where a movie genuinely gave me tingles for its eerie settings, vibe, and shots. Also a very well acted and even vocal performances mainly by Lilly-Rose, Nicholas, and Bill."
Rhonda S,5,"This was a great movie!
I loved the way it was filmed, the atmosphere and everything about it.  The music was also perfectly balanced to the mood of the movie."
No Name,5,"A lot of people might not like this movie because they are used to comic book movies with a lot of action and little thinking. But Nosferatu is an amazing film that made me think for a few days about how well the film was shot, the great plot and acting. Nosferatu's voice is legendary. I am going to see it again this week."
Galilea,4,Acting was great but predictable.
No Name,5,Masterfully shot and stays true to the spirit of the source material that inspired it. I have seen some complaints that it is slow. But in truth this is not meant to be an edge of your seat horror thriller but in many ways it is more a gothic romance with horror elements. The pacing while probably somewhat jarring to some modern audiences is well within the theme of the original film and honors it while also adding its own unique elements. I expect this films stature to rise in the coming years.
babyness L,5,Excellent! Lily‚Äôs performance was amazing along with the rest of the cast. Loved the ending but sad.
Josh,4,A little bland- but a true rendition of Stolker‚Äôs original sorrow
No Name,5,"I'm always drawn to period pieces, knew it would be great from the trailers, and it didn't disappoint. Very intense and scary but excellent all around. Haven't seen the original since a cinema college course decades ago, will definitely have to re-watch that version too."
Max Bryant,3,"Great looking visuals and each cast member was very good.. The movie was okay bordering good in many parts. The story was slow in spots and had several moments of me questioning how ""that"" could possibly of  happened..
If you are a fan of the original and even Lugosi's Dracula you should see it. Then make your.own comparisons and opinions."
Patricia,5,Id like movies to be physically lighter.  The dark makes it hard to aee
MotoRacer,4,This is one of those rare movies that doesn't quite fit into its genre.  it's not a horror movie...  it's a horror experience. Not slasher scares but truly unsettling and unnerving.  Hard to recommend but it is delightfully dreadful.
Jared D,4.5,The movie starts off slow but once it picks up it stays interesting. Some scenes were just the right level of disturbing I needed to see. The acting was great too. It was well worth it to watch.
Lestat de Lioncourt,5,Captures Dracula exactly as he was envisioned!!!
Jorge A,0.5,I will never get 2hrs of my life back.
No Name,2.5,"Com base no que eu vi ao decorrer do filme que eles n√£o conseguiram o suficiente para o terror da qual esse Vampiro expressa no filme de 1928, mas concordo que foi elaborado e deu ar de esperan√ßa para o terror g√≥tico, n√£o √© ruim, mas deveria ser melhor com tamanho or√ßamento"
No Name,1,Like a box of rocks.DUMB!!!
No Name,2.5,Went to the bathroom towards the end and did go back.
Chris,3,"Very cinematic, but kind of slow."
brian g,2,"The story as ok, dialogue was troublesome, but the cinematic elements were beautiful"
Tim Reichard,0.5,"Not really scary. Nosferatu, the monster was goofy looking with a big mustache.  Kind of made the whole thing look silly."
No Name,3,"Convulsing, eye rolling, rats‚Ä¶ the pinnacle of originality"
Jeff L,3,"Not half a scary as the original. Too long and needed better editing.  Movie never draws you in. Some of the scenes needed better direction. Not terrible, not great."
Eric,4,"The movies was great , could had a little bit more of action but the acting was on point."
Lolani F,4.5,"Very much enjoyed it.  Yes, it is a ‚Äúslow‚Äù start, but it made sense to me. The first act sets up just what Count Olag/Nosferatu is capable of, and I felt a slowly growing sense of dread and intensity the whole film through. Will definitely watch again once it‚Äôs out on disc."
No Name,2.5,"It is a movie that adds to the original movie from 1922. However, some points stands:
1.there are too many sexual scene and teases and does add little to nothing to the movie.
2.runtime can be shortened with so much unecessary scenes; people walking and transpiring?
3.motif? Coherence? Mad scientist? All of stereotypes of movies are present.  I expect better story telling after a 100 years. You should not just add more scenes and details, but also give meaning to them."
No Name,1,"Absolute garbage!! I fell asleep, bad acting, bad story I even started laughing a few times. I can not understand the hype for this movie the original 1922 version was ten times better! What a waste of money!!"
Sukhmani  C,4,"Gore, jump scares, very intriguing and a unique plot. So worth the watch, enjoy!!"
No Name,1,Worst movie I have seen in a long time. Extremely boring. Nothing like Dracula with Wynona Ryder! I tried to leave but my husband wanted to finish his beer.
Linda L,1,"Its hard to know where to begin. The acting was terrible. The set decoration was messy and uninteresting. Many of the scenes were centrally focused and uninteresting.  It was boring, plodding, and anemic. Dont waste your time on this one."
JH,1,Dreadful. Simply dreadful
No Name,3,I was expecting more horror it want bad just not my tastes in horror movies
No Name,5,Perhaps one of the greatest gothic horrors ever put to film.
Michelle,2,A remake that shouldnt have been remade
No Name,0.5,This movie left me exhausted. Same visuals you‚Äôve seen before. A lot of unnecessary artsy shots and scenes. No character development. It‚Äôs just icky. I feel like things were put in for pure shock value. No substance. The acting was bumpy. I landed up leaving early.
David,1,very poor remake on Bram stokers Dracula. don't waste your money like I did.
Richard D,0.5,Redundant. So dark you cant see anything. Disjointed. Terrible film
No Name,0.5,"Nosferatu (2024) misses the mark by leaning heavily into shock value. Both versions are great at world building and atmosphere but the poorly written script and outdated themes overwhelmed any positives. 
Movies or scenes that include sexual violence tropes that aren‚Äôt necessary, are boring at this point. It‚Äôs a tired, cliched tactic and this movie offers no new insight and relies far too much on trying to make the audience uncomfortable then making those scenes relevant. 
The necrophilia scene, in my opinion, was a disgusting addition to the story. I understand vampires are the undead and there are many themes of sex and lust within vampire stories but Anna wasn‚Äôt a vampire - she was just a dead woman. In the room with their two dead children. Bleak. 
You can‚Äôt give consent when you‚Äôre being threatened. It‚Äôs no longer consent at that point. So for everyone saying Ellen consented at the end by saying the words ‚ÄúI consent‚Äù - literally he was threatening to kill everyone in the town if she didn‚Äôt have sex with him and she decided to sacrifice herself (that doesn‚Äôt equal consent). 
The film‚Äôs pacing drags, the tension never truly builds, and the result is a drawn-out experience doesn‚Äôt offer any new insight to an old, over-used trope."
No Name,0.5,"This movie was photographed well but it's boring, overlong and the editing is so disjointed that you'll lose interest. I've seen the other versions of Nosferatu and they stand up well over time. You will note that most critics are raving about the cinematography, really ?  Its dark for no real purpose. Most movies based upon this theme are really like westerns, hero vs villain's, showdowns, carriage chases at midnight or sun up, Innocent damsel in distress waiting for Dudley Do Right ! Even the old Hammer films got it right!  Coppola's Dracula was one of the  best I ever saw and this movie isn't in the same ball park. Frank Langella's was the epitome of cool up to that point. Save your money the advertisements are fake news ! :-)"
No Name,1,One star for the production value. The story is what matters most and without drawing from memories of earlier versions it does not hold up on its own. It has terrible writing and characters we don‚Äôt care about. It was actually stupid. It makes Coppola‚Äôs look like even more of a masterpiece.
Stef,4,I liked Dracula better.
Dennis L,5,Loved it great shooting and atmosphere. Dep was amazing Olocks look was way different then I thought is would be
Cara,3,"I dozed off twice in this movie.  This movie was not for me.  Maybe if I had more knowledge on the subject matter, I would have appreciated this film.  Nosferatu was hard to understand and his asthmatic breathing was distracting and unnecessary.   Save your money people!   Wait until it's streaming online!"
Steve B,5,"This movie has an unsettling feeling throughout. Its a fresh inspired by but not a copy of Dracula.  Great production design and makeup. It also has some very intense moments. Just when you think the movie is moving a little slow something happens that makes you realize its not slow, its perfectly paced. The rats and what came with them (not spoiling) was a clever backdrop. As a seasoned movie goer its hard to scare me but this movie pulled it off, and its just creepy."
Dylan,3.5,Incredible acting‚Ä¶ but wtf?
No Name,1,The weirdest and most genuinely disturbing movie that I have ever seen in theaters. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to my worst enemy.
No Name,1.5,I need therapy after watching this
Preston,2,"Personally, did not like it.  The acting was weird.  Maybe that‚Äôs what people were like in the 1800s but it seemed exaggerated.  The plot was weird (just a rotting corpse that drinks blood).  Just not my cup of tea.  I‚Äôll stick to sexy vamps with cool powers."
John M,3,"Good, but a little slow"
E F,4,"Stunning visuals , costume and set design added both elegance and horror to the story."
No Name,1,I was hoping for a sexy vampire movie and this was not that! Very cinematic odds all I can say that was positive. I cannot get the last three hours out of my mind quick enough!
PayPal U,2,Confusing plot and story line. Only one jump scare.
Scotty,5,"This is an EPIC masterpiece of Gothic horror. As a horror movie buff, this is one of the greatest horror movies I've ever seen. The atmosphere is absolutely chilling,  the camera work is delicious, the acting superb, and the scares are real and consistent throughout. I saw it Christmas evening and I couldn't wait to go see it again ....better than I expected it could be...."
Peter R,1,Did not keep our attention at all.
No Name,0.5,"Oof‚Ä¶ over acted, character motivation all over the place, and boring. Very disappointing. One of the worst movies I‚Äôve seen."
No Name,1,It was really slow and melodramatic. If it‚Äôs aim was period nostalgia it hit if it‚Äôs aim was horror it failed badly‚Ä¶
Josie,3,Perfect watch for a cold snowy afternoon but any other time mighthave felt more laborious.
George C,2.5,"The ending was very satisfying, but the process of getting there was very boring at times."
carl c,1.5,This movie didn‚Äôt have a plot. If it did it was a horrible one
No Name,0.5,"Absolutely awful. Probably one of the worst films I‚Äôve ever seen. Plot was way too long, and hard to follow. Movie was boring and I should have left half way through"
No Name,5,"As someone who has seen the original, grown up in Germany, and has roots in the Balkans, I deeply appreciate Nosferatu. Robert Eggers has impressed me once again with his mastery of folklore horror, as well as his respect for and consideration of different cultures and languages across Europe. The film stays true to the original, and I am truly grateful that they showed such great appreciation for this classic, rather than altering it to suit modern audiences simply for the sake of it. The actors all did an excellent job portraying their characters, and the scenes, backgrounds, and settings were absolutely stunning."
Scott W,5,Best rendition of the Dracula story Ive ever seen. Great setting the mood well acted and very entertaining.  Not to be missed.
No Name,4,Absolute must see. I have never seen the original and have been intrigued by the story. Anyone thinking that this film is a horror it is not. It is much more.... Now to watch the original!!!
Sheena,4,"Suspenseful, great sets and body costumes."
No Name,5,"A beautiful, thought-provoking and scary interpretation of Dracula/Nosferatu."
Andrew C,4,"Overall, I loved the tone that we come to expect with an Eggers movie. While highly enjoyable, some scenes felt forced. But I love that it felt like an old and new film all at once. Acting was impeccable by all those involved."
No Name,5,"For the fans of dark romance a must see movie, heartwarming and humoristic. The visuals are on the spot with the audio, tickling and exiting."
No Name,1,"Walked out after 30 minutes. Cross between a bad period drama and a Mel Brooks parody (which might have been a whole lot better). Very dissapointed, only went to see it for Bill Skarsgard as IT was so good."
No Name,5,"Slow, Long, but very haunting and brilliant!"
jtrincon U,2,It was a very strange and grotesque version of the original movie
No Name,3.5,"I had high expectations for this one, and was left a little disappointed.  Great mood and dreamlike quality to the movie.   It just felt unnecessarily long in the theater, and unnecessary overall.  That's my main issue. Was this take on Nosferatu really necessary?  Did it offer anything new?  My answer is no.  It's good, but nothing special.  I think the script needed a bit of work and more focus."
Andrew,5,Bill skarsgard from pennywise to count orlok my goodness the talent in that human
No Name,0.5,Vampire movie cliche + Vampire movie cliche + Vampire movie cliche ad nauseum: I tried hard not to laugh out loud so as not to spoil anyone else‚Äôs enjoyment. I was not always successful.
No Name,5,"It won‚Äôt be for everyone, if you expecting some teen horror movie with jump scares this movies isn‚Äôt for you.
The acting is 10 out of 10 same it goes for the way they decided to film it. Brings back memories of old movies but better adapted for today. At the end of its core it‚Äôs a dark romance"
No Name,2.5,"Good acting, got the message, sometimes beautiful... but boring. Halfway throught the movie I just wanted it to end and though some might find ""poetry"" in the ending, to me it was just ""meh""."
Sara M,1,The acting was horrendous. The pacing was slow. Gore added for shock value that was completely out of place. I almost thought it was a parody. I should have walked out.
craig,4.5,"Well done classic‚Ä¶. The mustache threw me, but otherwise a good watch‚Ä¶"
No Name,1,"Clearly a disappointment, it was a poor version of Bram Stokers Dracula.  Sad that some actors signed up for this for just a paycheck."
C.W.,2,"The cinematography, sets, and acting were outstanding, making Nosferatu worth seeing. However, the movie was hard to follow, and the gratuitous violence was gruesome and distracted from the story. We left the movie feeling disappointed in a film that should have been an excellent remake of a classic that, in our options, missed the mark."
No Name,5,"Two hours of fan service to gothic horror, classic cinematography and vampire lore. If this is a genre you like, this movie covers all the bases. It even has perfect 1830s costumes. It conveys creeping dread through out the film. The actors also worked hard to create that atmosphere.  Best vampire movie in 30 years in my opinion. Must see film for gothic horror fans. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a vampire romance or fast paced horror thriller, this is NOT that style.  Probably not the movie for you."
Demerise,1,"It was awful. Ended up leaving after an hour. Slow plot, difficult to see the film was so dark"
Stephen V,4,"Great style, strong acting, and a very refreshing approach to a very familiar story. Definitely worth seeing on a big screen. The visuals are gorgeous"
No Name,2,"Nosferatu was more interested in having sex than other thing, they principal characters never fight o even try to fight to the moster, i know that is a super power creature but really nothing ? It okey the movie for me is a 6/10."
No Name,4,"The story feels a bit thin, and the end underwhelming, but everything else is top notch. Amazing cinematography, great acting, great direction. Amazing atmosphere. Just wish the story took bigger swings."
John,2,Unfortunately left the theater feeling disappointed‚Ä¶
Gary,0.5,Worst movie i have scene in over a decade. I actually left 1/2 way through it was so bad and I love science fiction.
No Name,4.5,Robert Eggers makes the case with Nosferatu that he may be unrivaled when it comes to auteur horror. The film punctuates the tragedies of its familiar story with a nuanced layer of visceral horror that only Eggers is capable of producing. Ari Aster may be the only other horror director who can come close.
Chloe,2.5,Good for people who like older movies. It was a lot to understand and thats not my cuppa.
Louisa,0.5,Watching the plot play out was as hard as listening to nails on chalkboard.
No Name,5,"Excellent!
I don't miss any vampire or vampire-adjacent movies. I'm a vampire junkie. This one checks all the boxes. The hype you've been hearing is true. Pay attention or you'll miss the origin of it all. One of the best movies I've seen."
Christopher David Baum,5,Im Romanian: The movie was (Authentic) in every way to our culture and lore.
Julie T,5,Excellent movie. I love the classic feeling of it.
No Name,1,Awfully boring. Vampire movies made 30 years ago were scarier and had better moments. This was a waste of time
No Name,3,Takes a while to get going but when Willem Dafoe turns up it starts to cook
Color,5,PHENOMENAL!!!! Amazing cinematography
Marissa,3.5,"You know when a movie INSISTS UPON ITSELF??? Well, I didn‚Äôt until I watched this. It‚Äôs a great allegory for repressed SA trauma or trauma in general, but the run time could‚Äôve been halved and had the same impact. Willem was the best part. ‚ÄúTHEN RAVE SHE MUST!!!‚Äù"
No Name,5,Words will immaculately fall short for this cinematic magnum opus of the entire horror genre!! I bow down to thee- Mr. Eggers. Unparalleled horror era has begun!!
Matthew P,2.5,Awesome visuals and acting but the story falls short.
David,3,"loved the style, artsy shots, costumes were stellar ! not sure about the execution though. I feel like finale just kind of happened."
Dr√©,5,"3rd watch‚Ä¶ IMAX ‚Ä¶ LILACS EVERYWHERE!

The soul is sacred. The shadows will consume in the AFTER HOURS of the night. Admitting that evils do exist within us is the only way to put them at bay-  to be able to exist with them and not become lost because of them. 

‚ÄúYou are my affliction.‚Äù - Count Orlok"
No Name,5,Bill Skarsgard what an actor.
Caleb,3,"This movie succeeded in art direction, excelled in individual performances, but lacked a script that ventured to do anything interesting with its beautiful world and characters. Remarkably safe but addled with the pieces of a truly inspired film."
russW121,4,"It was a beautiful peace of cinema and story telling, had me on the edge of my seat for a majority of the movie"
No Name,1.5,"The lighting and cinematography were undeniably stunning, with beautifully shot scenes that captured a gothic aesthetic. However, the movie itself fell flat for me. Despite my love for gothic-style and horror films, this one was incredibly slow and boring. At times, my friend and I found ourselves laughing at moments that were clearly not intended to be humorous, they just came off as ridiculous. It wasn‚Äôt scary, the plot was riddled with holes, and many scenes felt unnecessary, as though they were added to just elongated the film. Honestly, you could cut a significant portion of the movie, and it wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. I wouldn‚Äôt watch it again or recommend seeing it in theaters."
No Name,0.5,"I couldn't make it to the end, it was so awful. My friend and I were both laughing at the acting and the script. Sure, it looks good which I expected from Eggers but the Count sounded like he had emphysema and Ellen sounded like she was in a Mill's and Boon novel. Very disappointing."
Kyle,4.5,Its a masterpiece. Its filmed beautifully in every shot. The acting is phenomenal and the story was so well written. It was the perfect re imagining of the original.
Jackie G,5,"If you like the classics, this is a must see! Cinematography is awesome. Great costuming, Relentless tension."
No Name,1,This movie was absolutely terrible. If I had one to describe this movie it would be ‚Äúeww‚Äù. I had high hopes for this movie considering the reviews rated it high but I think it‚Äôs only appealing to certain people who are there to enjoy the film-making and cinema behind it but it is not good if you are looking for a good scare. The whole time I watched it I just cringed.
No Name,1,Muito chato! N√£o mant√©m nossa aten√ß√£o at√© o fim... Roteiro ruim...
No Name,0.5,"I think this is the second worst movie I've ever seen - better than Human Centipede 2, and slightly worse than the original. 

The plot was boring and you have to try and figure out what's happening. The pace was very slow, and the visuals were way too dark. The characters weren't very developed, which is even worse when so much time is wasted."
No Name,0.5,The main actress did a subpar acting job. They made Dracula look like it was the corpse of Joseph Stalin it was a huge let down not scary at all and laughable if you want to watch a Nosferatu then watch the 1922 version it is actually gives you the chills and nightmares and all this done with no sound the 1922 version is not a talkie that version would get five stars this version if I could give it a quarter I would!
No Name,5,spunchbob squarepant
CTUAIR,5,Excellent new take on Dracula. Not just a repeat of the same old story.
gelviz,5,Great movie!!! 10/10 the whole cast did a phenomenal job and a amazing story
jason m,5,Just really well done. Beautiful movie.
Patricia,2,"Boring... Drawn out. Very old fashioned vampire style directing... They should have indicated in their previews that their movie would be that style. Me and the stranger next to me both fell asleep halfway through the movie...
Otherwise, spectacular acting from everyone"
Lisa P,1,"This movie was quite possibly one of the worst movies I‚Äôve ever seen. The movie itself was really dark and you can barely see what‚Äôs going on. The vampire spoke so slowly that I forgot what he started to say. It was so awful that we left 45 minutes into it‚Ä¶would have left earlier but I wanted to finish my $15 beer! I can‚Äôt believe critics called this brilliant! It was anything, BUT!"
xDivineChaosx,5,A classic. Beautifully shot and attention to detail was superb.
No Name,1,"This movie seemed to the start to be very promising with the period German town but it really just feels like a flat line..nothing interesting happens, not scary not exciting and the scenery in the mountains looked like western Canada not eastern Europe. Almost fell asleep 5 times..waste of a Friday night out."
No Name,4,A Little Long For Me But Otherwise Good Acting And Overall A Good Movie
No Name,0.5,the characters kept going into pound town literally in every scene.  If you are an icebreaker fan youll like this movie with the freaky characters
No Name,2.5,"The story was good, but the characters were not developed properly

Needed to be more of a love story

Touched all the bases

Amazing set design and costumes, etc.

From a production standpoint, it is outstanding"
Jani Na a was,4,Great cinematography!
No Name,2.5,I loved the cinematography of the film but Nosferatu is let down by being far too hammy and by playing it's plot cards far too early. The film lacks an emotional core and despite it's feminine credentials ultimately wants to have it's proverbial neck and eat it. Disappointing but it does look great.
NP,5,"Absolutely amazing. The acting, the set design, the costume design, the story. One of the best films I‚Äôve ever seen."
michael lyons,5,A great reimagining and addition to the Nosferatu films. Not recommended for people who like their vampires suave and well groomed.
No Name,2.5,"Its too bad that Bill Skarsgard looks like a zombie Doc Holiday from a Spaghetti western with that stupid mustache.It would also have been nice to not have to wait till half way through the movie to actually see him come out of such darkly lit scenes . Gary Oldman , and Tom Waits you remain the standard for me . A Dracula movie without Dracula is  ... fangless  ."
Rachel,0.5,Not good as horror or any other genre. So slow. Boring.
No Name,0.5,"This is the worst movie ive seen in a long long time. It‚Äôs slow, it doesnt make sense, it‚Äôs not scary. Not good."
JOSEPH,3.5,"Good cinematography, costuming and acting. Primary female character at times very difficult to understand her lines. Not really scary. Seemed a bit too long."
No Name,4,"Robert Eggers is the real star here, such a creative unique and amazing director. Making films like this in 2025, love it. Not as confusing or as good as the Lighthouse but better than his other movies, abit slow at times but the horror elements where so good, Orlok himself looked amazing and sounded even better and was brilliantly sinister, the whole cast where really good and of course the film had some spectacular shots."
Matthew J,2.5,"Average at best.  There‚Äôs not much new in this version that‚Äôs closer to being a failed remake attempt at bram strokers Dracula, which is far superior."
No Name,5,"Great and disturbing movie, not for everyone!
I enjoyed its style, every picture of it  can be printed as a wall poster."
No Name,0.5,"This is hands down the most cringe movie I've ever seen. It's as if someone took a room full of schizophrenic perverts and told them to make a vampire movie based on Nosferatu. If you're looking a for a real horror movie, go with Alien: Romulus."
No Name,0.5,Waste of time and money!
Matt,3,"Good film, just an OKAY movie. Not worth going to the theaters for"
Mikel,4.5,Liked it the first time. Loved it the second. This is the level of quality and attention to detail movies need these days.
No Name,2,"Movie very slow, and boring on my opinion"
Meccassault,3,"The cinematography, acting, and film score are all solid. The pace of the film was a bit drawn out in almost every scene, which sometimes works to its advantage and, at other times, not at all. it's worth a once over, especially if you prefer legitimate vampire films. But, more could've happened throughout with a better pace. it's definitely not a ""scary"" film, so if you go in expecting that, you'll be disappointed. There are, however, a few very intense moments I liked."
No Name,1,"Sorry, but this emporer has no clothes. This is a long, ponderous, overly self important and boring film. If not with friends I would have walked. Yes it is well done, and has lovely production values and homage to the original blah blah. 

But there is nothing frightening, the characters are bland and wholly predictable, it needs a proper edit as it is way too long, and I was just wanting the vampire to get it over with and kill everyone so I could go home. There is no suspense. 

Interesting themes such as the nature of evil and the intersection of sexuality and sin are squandered by heavy handed acting and direction. 

Our audience laughed out loud at scenes that were clearly not meant to be comedic, it was all so heavy handed. 

Not to mention the practical plot holes big enough by to drive a hearse through. 

Will get Oscar for best acting by pigeons and rats......

Good luck with it. Go in with low expectations and you will have a passable time. Go in believing the critics and you will be disappointed."
Jose Arrocha,5,Great movie. Fantastic visuals and performances. Dafoe stands out just as much as Skarsgard‚Äôs title character. Hoult continues to be a brilliant risk taker. Able to blend his talents into the different tones of a genre like in this and Renfield. Some of the best use of a vampires abilities and limitations in cinematic history are displayed.
Enrique Ramirez,5,"Arte 
en esta pel√≠cula he regresado a ver por qu√© el cine es Arte."
Tammy,1,Very slow. Was falling asleep
No Name,0.5,"Boooooring as hell......The story is rubbish outer locations of castle look like a cardboard cutout,The movie is so bad any sort of acting can't save it, all those positive reviews and appreciation were a big scam....My head started hurting in between.... It's a terrible film."
MARCI K,1,"Gory, bloody, disgusting display of a vampire.  I have seen many Dracula and Vampire movies that were entertaining however, this one was over the top with gross!  Could not even watch most of the disturbing killing scenes.  Omg."
No Name,2,"6 of 10

Beautifuly made movie, just not exciting nor interesting. Orlok's body looked CGI & out of place in many scenes.

 Seems to be Eggers thing, to wow everybody via eye candy but forget to entertain ?! Lot of plot cohesion was lost due to drawn out cinematography for visuals, could've been 40 minutes shorter. This is a gothic/art house romance not horror IMO."
mike d,4,"Gorgeous looking movie while being terrifying as well.  The pacing feels very off though, so I hope the extended version helps that"
No Name,5,"I went into this with low expectations. It had been out for two and a half weeks and I could see on social media it was getting very mixed reviews.  Some people hated it. Some people loved it but not too many saying it was so-so. I loved it. I knew that it wasn't going to be a Friday the 13th. kind of scary. My fear was that it was going to pay so much homage to the original that it was going to feel like an art piece. Which it is, but it's also very entertaining. No cheap scares but plenty of creep. Every actor did an excellent job. Great movie making."
Taylor,0.5,Overly sexualized- storyline very predictable because they narrated everything before it happened
No Name,3,I expected more horror.
Dan,4,Nosferatu? More like nice for-a you! to watch!
No Name,3,"Starts off quite well, but gets kinda dull and there's a some cringe moments."
Shara,2,We thought it was very dark.
No Name,2,"Beautifully shot/edited, good acting too for the most part, but the plot moved too slowly, there was not enough emotional connections to the characters that die/get killed which contributed to a low-stakes/easy-mode storyline."
Karen B,5,"Classic for years to come., and a masterpiece of horror"
No Name,1,Waste of money went to see it based on the 85% on rotten tomatoes  was slow and not worth my time
Ryan  R,5,A very spooky remake of an on old silent film.
No Name,0.5,"Calling it borderline unwatchable is too good for this movie. I'd rewatch Nicholas Cage's worst movie on repeat than suffer through this cinematic garbage. Astounding the amount of money thrown at these people writing good reviews for this visual hot garbage. Dracula (1931) has better writing and plot points. The entire theater laughed several times at what was meant to be dramatic and severe moments, atleast for those who didn't walk out."
No Name,0.5,Don‚Äôt believe any of the crap reviews about this movie. I‚Äôm an insomniac and this movie was so bad it put me to sleep multiple times. This movie is one of the worst movies I‚Äôve seen in 48 years. It was the third worst movie I‚Äôve ever seen in a theater. It should get negative stars.
Cars,4,Superb acting and defining visuals. Hated the mustache.
Steven S,3,"Great atmosphere, costumes and setting and general mood of the period a little plodding and not scary at all. I also wish demon boy didnt talk so much."
No Name,5,"Beautiful scenes, solid cast, nice storytelling."
Eric L,0.5,Awful. I would give a negative star if possible. Tedious and made me wish I were watching Bela Lugosi.
William H,5,A incredibly great movie. Bill Skarsgrd was phenomenal and Willem Dafoe killed it. Robert Eggers is great director!
Gabe,3.5,"Solid movie, interesting story. Terrible audio and screen quality at the theater."
Robert,4,"Decent movie. Not exactly a horror movie in the traditional sense, but definitely has some creepy moments with great atmosphere."
No Name,5,"Best movie in years, absolutely impeccable"
No Name,3,"A very impressive remake much in the style of Eggers' other works. A obscure and dense atmosphere; impactful I would say, just like the monster. A very good, dark cinematography"
Louis,3,"Good, but sort of hard to follow in the beginning (slow beginning mind u), very interesting performances, great lure, great visuals, copies The Exorcist a little, but in a good way. Overall, 6.75/10"
No Name,2,"Visually beautiful, but ultimately boring. How do you make a horror movie in 2025 (well, released in 2025) and have people feeling the original made ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO is scarier?

It plodded along, and I wanted to fall asleep (I love horror movies, and I love many ‚Äúslow‚Äù movies). I saw another review that praised the cinematography, saying every shot was made with such care. And actually that‚Äôs kind of the problem. Every single frickin thing was apparently filmed to be a piece of art. Overwrought! Overdone! Just get on with the story! And oh my gosh, the length of this movie‚Ä¶.an hour too long.

And the mustache was stupid and distracting. The people involved in this were a little too high on their own vapors."
No Name,0.5,Almost walked out a few times
No Name,3.5,"This movie is an engaging experience, even if it doesn‚Äôt tread entirely new ground narratively. Robert Eggers‚Äô signature style is evident in the poetic interplay of cinematography, set design, and composition. The visual storytelling often speaks louder than the script, capturing a mood that lingers. The actors deliver strong performances, but the film‚Äôs true star is its meticulous framing‚Äîfrequent off-center subjects set against intricate, atmospheric backdrops tell a story all their own."
No Name,0.5,"I don't understand the positive reviews. Did you actually watch the same film? It's absolute garbage. Terrible pacing and acting, boring and drab. Borderline unwatchable at times. It feels like the reviews are paid for! ""Best dracula movie ever' I find these views exaggerated. Watch this film and you'll feel the same."
No Name,0.5,Hate it so much it was boring
SandNerd,1.5,Disgusted? 100%. Scared? 0. Atmosphere? 100%. Narrative? 0.
No Name,0.5,"This was soooo baddd!!! Movie was super slow paced. Almost fell asleep. The visuals were terrible. The ‚Äúhorror‚Äù scene were sooo hilarious, i couldn‚Äôt take it seriously. Count orlok sucking people off on the cest and dey humping them while doing so was the stupidest thing ive seen. The movie isnt even coherent. The ending was so bad, like, they did nothing! Absolutely nothing. The whole arc and story was meaningless! Dont waste your money on this. Just rewatch bram strokers dracula instead."
Carlisha.C,5,Love the classic Dark Gothic Horror feel! The actors are superb!
Wigan shopper,4,Great cinematography and well acted. Willem Dafoe plays it camp throughout. Story tracks with tradition and the a few dekes. Seemed a little long in part but overall a very good rendition.
No Name,3,"There‚Äôs much to admire in this movie, especially how it looks and sounds, but there‚Äôs not much to love."
Rick Thunderblood,5,"Best Dracula movie, hands down!"
No Name,2.5,"It looks great, incredibly atmospheric. 

There are some good points: the cast, the soundtrack and sound design, the art direction, set design, costume design are all great. In terms of gothic vibes and cinematography, it is the most beautiful film I‚Äôve seen.

However: it‚Äôs not scary, the story isn‚Äôt particularly interesting, and Nosferatu the vampire talks came across as silly. Certain elements became a little tedious."
Rebecca,5,Scary as heck. Stuck close to book in the first half which was cool. Last 15 minutes are crazy!
No Name,0.5,"Nosferatu is an absolute disgrace to the horror genre. It doesn‚Äôt even hold a candle to the chilling original‚Äîit‚Äôs just plain gross. And not in the way you might expect from a horror film, where tension or gore create a sense of unease; no, this film‚Äôs vulgarity overwhelms everything that could have made it redeemable. While the costume and set are remarkable, the movie itself feels less like a terrifying exploration of the supernatural and more like a poorly executed, borderline soft-core porno. The atmosphere, instead of invoking dread or suspense, drips with uncomfortable and unrelenting crassness. If you were hoping for a compelling vampire tale, you're in the wrong place. Nosferatu isn‚Äôt just a disappointment‚Äîit's a grotesque spectacle that seems more intent on being a soft-core porno, than providing any genuine horror."
Alucard,5,A nice nod to the past with a subtle touch to effects so the mind does the heavy lifting.
No Name,1.5,It‚Äôs a horror movie but at no point did I feel scared or feel any tangible threat. It was like an action movie. Made no sense. It was in English but characters were vocalised as Frau or Herr. The pace was concertinaed. Great photography and sound but the script and direction was awful tbh. The 1922 version is so much better. Pointless film in my humble opinion. So many other versions of Dracula have been done so well.
No Name,4,"A twisted tale like no other - Nosferatu delves deep into ideas of true psychosis, pain, and love. All whilst having a sick and horrific villain with his ambition set on his one true prize."
trequan,0.5,boring bad bad bad don't go
Daron,4,"I loved to sets and, the environment of the movie."
Susan,5,"Absolutely the BEST Dracula movie ever.  It was scary. The clothing for the time period was authentic and beautiful. Dracula didnt change from ugly to gorgeous, he stayed  horrible. Highly recommend."
No Name,5,"A masterpiece, best Vampire movie of all time, it brings a fresh perspective to the classic Dracula tale, a female perspective and her deepest and darkest desires"
No Name,3,"Beautifully shot and eerie throughout, but I left feeling like I've seen this before (for obvious reasons). Nothing new really happens, the ""heroes"" don't really do anything meaningful, Orlocs voice gets annoying and all this lasts for over 2hrs."
No Name,1,"I went to this movie with great expectations as I love horror films and vampire genres. 
Sadly, I was greatly disappointed.  It was nothing more than a love story with a less than thrilling finish.
I don't often feel like I could sleep when I go to the movies, but I have to admit that I came close to nodding off - twice."
Cory M,5,Amazing cinematography. Every shot was composed with care!
No Name,3,"This particular movie was a snooze fest. Very slow and drawn out. The visuals were great and it had great music scores, but it lacked in entertainment."
No Name,1,"Not a good story. It is obscene, and the character's solution to combat evil is to engage in an immoral act instead of exercising uncompromisable virtues."
No Name,2,Both fell asleep wanted to watch till the end but was very slow ended up leaving cinema and we never do that
No Name,5,The most beautiful movie I've seen in the last year.
No Name,4.5,"The first half of this movie is a bit slow. The last third of the movie kicked it really into gear. The allegories to sexual assault, the character's deceptions of each other, and the finale sequence are so well acted.

The movie had amazing cinematography that really did a good job of creating an eerie atmosphere.

Orlock was very creepy and I loved the focus on how he is almost a personification of dark sexuality.

The character growth for the main characters was a great journey."
No Name,1,"It's bad. Watched with a friend and I felt uncomfortable and not in a normal horror way this felt like porn at some points, the cinematography was good but it's a nock off Dracula with a crap plot and mid characters"
Victoria,2,Very slow. A lot of friends told me they fell asleep.
No Name,4,"The expectations were higher than what was delivered, but it is a good film. Truth is, Bram Stocker's Dracula is better still. I guess it's impossible to top Garry Oldman as Count Dracula"
No Name,5,"Germany, 1838. An estate agent has to travel to Transylvania to deliver a contract to a wealthy count living in a castle in the Carpathian Mountains. The mysterious old man intends to relocate to the same hometown where the young man lives with the love of his life, a troubled woman suffering from a supernatural possession. Upon his arrival, the creature covers the town with complete darkness and disease, revealing a voracious appetite for fresh blood. ""Nosferatu"" is a masterful ghotic tale in command of the major elements in horror: an exceptionally unsettling atmosphere, a terrifying monster, and stunning visuals. The movie exceeds the expectations in ressurecting the most iconic vampire in cinema, a remarkable achievement considering the inevitability of comparing this production with the original from 1922. An outstanding addition to the horror hall of fame!"
Neyland,3,Passed the time. Was a unique and good story but the movie didn‚Äôt feel scary or suspenseful. Felt like I was watching a drama with Jim Carrey from Sonic as the bad guy. Wasn‚Äôt scary.
No Name,5,"Robert Eggers' Nosferatu is an arresting reimagining of F.W. Murnau‚Äôs 1922 masterpiece, blending gothic horror with Eggers' meticulous commitment to historical authenticity and atmosphere. The film is a triumph of art direction, with every frame meticulously composed to evoke the haunting beauty and existential dread of its source material. From the claustrophobic cobblestone streets to the eerie glow of moonlit castles, Eggers' world feels alive, pulsating with both menace and melancholic beauty.

Eggers has crafted what can only be described as the definitive vampire film of the 21st century, transcending genre conventions to explore deeper themes of desire, corruption, and the eternal battle between light and darkness. The film's atmosphere is oppressive yet captivating, weaving a spell that lingers long after the credits roll. In a landscape dominated by disposable genre fare, Nosferatu stands as a testament to the enduring power of cinema to reawaken the myths that haunt us, delivering not just a film, but a macabre symphony of shadow and light that cements its place as a modern classic."
Rodney B,3.5,"'Nosferatu' is a horror movie that is equal parts creepy, gory, disturbing and frightening.  It is beautifully shot and directed but for me falls short of being great because I didn't connect or relate to any of the characters.  That may be by design but it left me with a hollow feeling.   Like a meal that looks better than it tastes."
No Name,4.5,One of my all time favorite vampire type movies.
No Name,5,"NATURE VERSUS NURTURE, Robert Eggers' Nosferatu fills like a wide shadow cast upon man, hopelessly lived in, and the sound design throughout takes that immersion even further. Eggers' craft only expands with each entry of his."
No Name,1.5,"Dull, leaden film that loses all the subtle psychological nuances of earlier versions.  I fell asleep.  A real snorer."
No Name,1,"Wow. This was a HUGE disappointment. I found my self laughing more than feeling any sense of dread or fear. Cheap and pointless jump scares too. Loved the directors previous movies, but this was pretty boring and a let down. Oh and the Orlock design is ridiculous."
Jake,3,"Nosferatu is undeniably impressive from a production standpoint. Director Robert Eggers gets the most out of his cast and crew to transport audiences to a distinct time period. On a story level, however, the film is lacking the sophisticated edge that helped make the classic Dracula adaptations mesmerizing in a terrifying sort of way. This is especially true in the one-note presentation of  the titular Count, whose characterization is void of the academic humanity that gave more depth to prior portrayals. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining watch."
No Name,5,"I watched it at the cinema. The film draws the viewer into the film, making the viewer live the dark experience of the scenarios developed. I left the cinema scared of my own shadow. So that means the film is excellent."
Debra C,3.5,"Atmospheric and dark. We know the story, of course, but that didnt tamp down the anticipation of the ending. I dont know why they cast Skaarsgard because he was unrecognizable and the character had no real personality. The star, as is always the case with Eggers, is the art direction and creation of a whole world of building dread. Gave me nightmares all night after."
No Name,5,"Not for the modern adhd rattled brain.  This is a slower paced masterpiece.

Sensational acting, cinematography and a story that ties up with a great ending.

The special effects are on point.   A great remake.

This one should attract an academy award nomination."
No Name,3,"The last 1/2 was way more enticing than the opening. Slow start, storyline wavers, and just lethargic. Almost left and probably should have‚Ä¶"
No Name,0.5,"Honestly meh, with such a good cast, I really expected more, so disappointed to see actors I love struggle with a terrible script. The visuals were great, however, I cannot remember the last time I literally wanted to walk out of the cinema, furthermore, the ending literally made me laugh out loud, like this is what I waited 2 hours for? I don't know what it is nowadays with directors and production making 2/3 hour long movies when an hour would suffice, the plot would not have been lost and dragged on for far too long."
No Name,5,"Great movie. Besides all the scenography, i think the edition, the music and the sound are amazong. Involves you like you where there, whatching everithing as a ghost inspector"
Charles,5,Gave me the Bram Stoker's Dracula vibe! It was really good I give it A+ grade
No Name,2,No no no. Don't waste your precious time
No Name,1.5,"Possibly the worst version of the story to date. The acting was absurd.

The eye-straining cinematography was so dark that you could barely see anything through the entire film. Putting on a dark filter and shooting everything through it does not automatically make beautiful cinematography. He did the same in The Witch, and it was garbage, too.

The storyline flowed like a rope being pushed up a rocky hill and I couldn't take it seriously because Orloc looked like John Cleese as a vampire."
No Name,5,"Great cast, great wardrobe/costume design, great cinematography"
annoynoms,5,Loved the art and basically everything
Everett,2,just a movie about a old dude simping.
No Name,3.5,"Just left the cinema.. wouldn‚Äôt adress this movie as a horror one, hence some scenes may make you feel umpleasantly uncomfortable.
For me it is the power that we give to someone and what they do with it, and how, at some point the only way to cut the cord, is to end with yourself."
No Name,1.5,"Very slow and plodding. The plot points are unsurprising and rote for much of the movie and the characters are flat. The scares are pretty unsurprising and ineffective.
The vampire is pretty much just a random monster with no real characterization who talks far too slowly (and breathes too loudly, like all the time.)
I get that the sex scenes are meant to be transgressive, but they're often abrupt and/or add little of value. The final scene is cinematically interesting, but still, to sum it up, the female character's only worth appears to be her ability to sex the monster to death. 
Overall, boring and rehashed. The only thing they changed from every other Dracula movie was making the sexuality overt instead of implicit."
No Name,4,"The atmosphere created in the movie was dark, frighting and just amazing. Secondly, the sound effects were guttural. Just a small criticism...the antagonist could have been a little scarier...he lacked a little something. Other than that, the movie was great"
Alan R,3,If wasn't as scary as advertised. It was just okay.
Brian,4.5,A tad long but very good. Great scares as well.
judge,5,Frightening. Amazing cinematography.
No Name,5,Beautifully shot film with great performances all around. A disturbing and visceral commentary on repression and loneliness.
Oliver M,5,A remarkable achievement that will make your screen crawl and your jaw drop
No Name,3.5,"It was okay. They should‚Äôve just did a Bram Stoker‚Äôs remake. Although I like that it was inspired by Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula, I think it was a bit underwhelming. A Bram Stoker‚Äôs remake would‚Äôve been more exciting and the overall storyline would‚Äôve been better. It was also very anticlimactic. Much left to be desired here."
No Name,4,"Very scary and unnerving, beautifully shot and directed, terrific acting and production design all come up in this great gothic picture, which sometimes lets it down as it does not know if it wants to be a remake of the 1922 movie or just another adaptation of Dracula, which creates a very confusing tone."
No Name,0.5,It was a very bad b movie
Jim S,4,Visually elegant with occasionally confusing transitions and story threads. Sexuality is even more central than in most Dracula-derived films and the key to its dramatic resolution.
Mikey Meduim,4,"watching the original every year during the Halloween season for years. This was great. There are a few differences, but for the most part, it follows the original story. The cinematography was awesome. I really liked how the film looked. t
The acting was great, and the cast was on point. The only thing I didn't care for was the look of the title character. The original, in my opinion, was a lot more creepy and horrifying. Max did a great job with that. overall, I would definitely recommend this. I will be seeing this again and adding it to my year Halloween film runs."
No Name,1,"Nosferatu was kinda pretty. That is all.

No, I mean, that's really is ALL it was.  A dull regurgitation of a story told better a thousand times prior, draped in some vaguely interesting cinematography, and a Count Orlock with more of a throat cold than a character. I am baffled why critics and audience speak highly of it."
Den,5,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece. The casting was perfect and the acting superb. William DeFoe‚Äôs best work since The Lighthouse. The guy who wrote and directed this is a cinematic visionary. Even if you are not a fan of horror movies, the set designs and cinematography will mesmerize and leave you speechless. It deserves to sweep the Oscars."
Joe,4,"Great special effects, and a story that really needs to be seen on the big screen"
No Name,4,"The start of the movie was a bit slow, but the cinematography and the rushing ending make up for it."
Kevin,5,Incredible movie overall.
No Name,2,Too predictable and confusing. The end is despicable as it shows a weak Nosferatu unable to save himself for the sake of a woman.  The artistic direction was not bad but the amount of celebrities  starring in Nosferatu turned the attention elsewhere.
No Name,5,"Goth is back! Robert Eggers captures a terrifying story, and involving passion, this is so pure and sexy at the same time. The images are perfect, captivating and gothic, Lily gave a unbelievable performance, no cgi needed? Maaan"
No Name,1,"Disgusting; nothing but disgusting, pornographic garbage."
No Name,5,"I came out of the cinema with this excitement I haven't had since childhood. Absolutely loved it. 
It adds so much depth to the original story but it's still amazing on it's own and you can tell the director did its homework with all the details and meanings behind every decision. 
By far my favorite film I've seen in years <3"
No Name,2,"I had high hopes foe this movie, but the plot i very hard to keep up with it.

It was boring and couldn't help to fell sleep"
No Name,3.5,"True to his own style, Robert Eggers develops a solid film where suspense dominates terror. Without a doubt, the highlight of Nosferatu is the photography and the scenery, which help build the horrific path that we travel as viewers. However, towards the middle of the film it starts to get boring and makes it difficult to follow the plot without getting lost. As a final point to consider, despite the more than 70 prostheses used to create the character of Count Orlok, the film lacks large shots that honor and show this great work in great detail, leaving a somewhat bitter taste. To sum up, Nosferatu is totally worth it with a few strong points that will keep you enthralled for much of the plot, but at the same time it is a particular and more psychological style of cinema that can cause you to lose attention towards the end of the film."
John,4,Stylish and beautiful and scary.
Stan,2,Just didn't like it.
Robert M,2,Fairly boring and predictable.  I would have left but Im too frugal.   I guess we need a bad movie once in a while to keep our comparison ability in tact.
No Name,5,"A horror movie for the pure of horror heart. The many references to previous tellings of the classic monster do not detract, but rather form a new context where they unify the story. All character names are new here, but we know who they are. We don't know the secret of the grotesque gouhl's undoing or if it is possible until the horrific final scene, but we do feel for the characters grieving the terrifying carnage of an unrelenting beast. The Intensity is a lot to bear for most audiences, but the cinematography, sets, costumes and dialog create a plausible world in which a vampire might emerge."
Sean M,2,Slow moving. And the end was corny.  The all powerful vampire died because it couldn‚Äôt resist and get away from the girl?
No Name,5,"I found this movie excellent, both the story and the characters, the gothic atmosphere, so dark, the character of Count Orlok seemed sinister to me, I can say that it scared me a lot, but what I didn't like about this movie are the screamers, since in today's horror movies Nowadays it's very repetitive but I loved it in the end"
No Name,3,"Nosferatu is a beautiful film with stunning cinematography. The performances were strong across the board. That said, Nicholas Hoult truly stood out with his fantastic portrayal. The makeup design, costumes, and quirky elements were all exceptional.

However, at times, it watched like the cast was divided between two different films‚Äîa serious period drama/tragic gothic romance‚Äîwhile also leaning into the absurdity of a wacky episode of Family Guy. I also believe the film could have benefited from trimming about 30 minutes; I don‚Äôt think we would have missed anything significant, as there was quite a bit scenery chewing throughout."
No Name,0.5,"It's just some cheap demon porno. They're just trying to make money off of showing you a ton of twisted demonsex. That's it. It's like they sat in a boardroom somewhere and thought ""we need an edgy angle for our movie that hasn't been done before"" and someone said ""let's REALLY pump up the demon sexuality and throw it in everyone's face"". Whatever. Welcome to capitalism. It was a bad movie though on top of being really cringeworthy with it's attempted demonsex edginess. And Nicholas Holt is one of my least favorite actors ever"
Harry R,0.5,It was boring.  I keep falling asleep.  The pace was way too slow.
Cartier,4,"A beautifully shot and compelling tale  - definitely a gift for the ""goths"" of the world.  It's a little slow and long some times with some missed opportunities for character development in a few cases - too much time spent on unnecessary nuances."
Barbara  R,4,"Eerie, great cinematography . Better than the typical vampire movie."
No Name,5,Awesome movie! I love Vampires and this is a really good Vampire movie!
No Name,1,Bro I can‚Äôt this movies is ass
Patricia,0.5,Hard to understand what they were saying. To drawn out.
tyler,4,Very dark and errie film. Beautiful visuals and cinametography.  Acting was also superb.
No Name,0.5,"Both crap and disturbing at the same time. Comically awful vampire accents, lots of truly gross make-up and vomiting, strange message that the way to beat the devil is to shag him. It was over-long, camp beyond measure, and quite upsetting. Stressful and boring at the same time. Quite an achievement!"
No Name,0.5,Definitely wasn't a 15 and why in hell did they give Nosferatu a giant handle bar mustache and a comb over. It totally spoiled it for me orloks tash scared me more then his evil doings
gregory  a,3.5,"Great script 
Great cast
Great movie!!"
No Name,4.5,"Anyone who posts 1 star reviews only went because they were told the Pennywise guy was in it, and are not real functional people. They watch tiktok and nothing else. This was a great movie, not overly sexual. Not super scary, but the feeling of dread is everywhere. If you're into atmospheric movies, go see it."
emli,1,The movie is not great at all. No active that much. I dont get enjoy that movie. Thanks
No Name,5,"I loved Eggers latest Film! A reimagining of the classic horror tale that pays homage to its roots while breathing new life into the genre. The performances are captivating, particularly Lily Rose and Bill Skarsgard, whose portrayal of the iconic Count Orlok is menacing. The film's innovative use of shadow and light enhances its eerie aesthetic, making each scene a visual feast."
No Name,5,The best gothic horror movie i have ever seen with a thrilling atmosphere and incredible visuals. An excellent cast and a tense and atmospheric score. A return to form for the horror genre.
G.I. Joe,5,"It was an excellent reboot of the original 1922 version. The plot and the characters were very faithful to the original - I was impressed. I am not a fan of horror movies, but this one at least was a classic - and it didn't disappoint."
Matt,0.5,Horrible! Slow start. Over acting.
Katy,3,"The first half was great and freaky, but the second half tried too hard to be scary, so it wasn't. Lily-Rose Depp's spoken acting was annoying throughout, too, and distracted me from the story. It sounded more like play acting than screen acting. Loved the other actors. Was hoping this would be better, so I'm a bit disappointed."
No Name,3.5,"This movie is an updated culmination of the old Hammer horror movies (the scared afflicted town folk, the sensical slayer of evil, the damsel in distress, and the terror) with more gore. It's entertaining though. I thought ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" was a better, scarier, and new kind of vampire movie."
No Name,2.5,"Bram Stoker's Dracula 1992 is far superior, if you have seen that film you wouldn't miss much by avoiding this film.
This is a film that didn't need to be made, a remake of a film that plagiarised Bram Stoker's Dracula. 

Most seems are too dark, either moon or candle light is the main light source."
Jerel H,4,"I went into this with low expectations, despite the online fanfare. Boy was I impressed. This is a wonderfully written, beautifully shot film, with great performances from everyone involved."
No Name,3,"Nosferatu is a modern film written in the movie style of the past. The characters, the time, the speech, the filmotography and events take place in 1848. As such, Nosferatu is not your modern horror film so don't expect an epic fight scene with a near impossible to kill enemy. Do expect wonderful imagery, story writing, acting and a storyline which is mostly well thought out and complicated which adds to its intrigue.

I enjoyed the film but I also found my mind wandering at times as the storyline is not straightfoard. You really have to pay attention to the details and the dialog. Why am I giving a rating of 3 vs 4 or 5? I was not thrilled with the ending. To be fair, I should have expected it as the film does try to follow an ""older"" story telling technique.

As I mentioned, there is no epic fight scene. When I left the film, I googled the ending to make sure I understood it. I had a theory and it was mostly correct but not exact. I would have to watch the film again to see if I simply missed some obvious clues. Perhaps the Professor's final speech to Ellen? I don't expect to have the ending handed to me on a thoughtless platter either. 

This is not a kiddie film by any means and I would suggest only serious supporters of the genre and those who want to see a well acted film watch it. There is plenty of eroticsm and nudity."
No Name,4,"Excellent addition to the vampire genre. Dark, moody, scary and gruesome at times. A big Fangs Up from me! üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Guy,1,"They tried to make an art film, but it did not work boring boring boring"
No Name,0.5,"I so wanted to walk out of this, but my friend liked it, so I powered through. So dissapointing, I really like the original Nosferatu and I also like Eggers other movies, so I looked forward to this one. There was no tention for me, nothing that felt like high stakes, nothing that kept me interested. A bit of nuditiy, a bit of blood, lots of necrophiliac sex where it didn't need to be and the only character I liked a little was the blonde friend. It felt overacted and I had to laugh out loud multiple times during the scenes that seemed to be a homage to The Exorcist and the like, but didn't cut it. Someimes I asked myself if this movie is a secret parody. I feel like Eggers wanted to shock more and hit the audience over the head with messages about female mental health issues and sexual shame than make a really good, deep version of this creature and let's face it, nothing in this movie can shock most people today. It has all been done and better than that. Nosferatu has no depth as a character, which is the biggest shame of this mess. Back to the classics."
No Name,4.5,"Disturbing, gross in parts and very haunting. Sk√•sgards performance was downright harrowing. Will stay with me for a while."
Michael P,5,"If you enjoy gothic horror, this film is one of the very best Christmas presents you could possibly receive this year. A treasure!"
Tiyare,3,Decent. Definitely not what I expected.
No Name,0.5,Literally awful.. I don‚Äôt get how this is so highly rated.
Josh,3,"The movie was interesting and entertaining, but also really dragged at times.  I think it could have been more successful if it was about 30 minutes shorter."
Kane,0.5,"Walked out of this movie. Hard to follow, way too sexual. Waste of time and money."
Kaitlyn,2,Honestly prettying disturbing and overtly sexual when it didnt need to be.
No Name,4,"7,7 (bom filme) - Robert Eggers adaptou a obra antiga de modo a aprofundar a rela√ß√£o entre ""Elen"" e o ""Orlok"", foi uma boa constru√ß√£o linear, um pouco prolongada; o filme tem uma boa barriga de meia hora que poderia ser facilmente retirada do filme; sobre a historia em si, por ser um remake n√£o irei comentar muito. Referente as atua√ß√µes, Willem Dafoe arrebenta como sempre, o NIcholas Hoult achei ""ok"", mas √© opini√£o pessoal, ele tem cara de bob√£o, n√£o tem meu carisma... a lily rose e o Rill Skargard, esses sim entregam tudo, foi incrivel o modo como eles atuaram, deixo um adendo para a cena em que a personagem Elen e o Thomas est√£o brigando e a lily rose surta e come√ßa a revirar a cara, isso foi desconfortavel,a dorei a cena; a propira dublagem do nosferatu estava pavorosa de bom;  a imagem do filme √© linda, pouca luz, muita sombra, lente azul a luz do sol (e no castelo do Orlok) e lente amarela durante a noite para dar enfase ao fogo (em certo momento nas lamparinas, em outro nas tochas), uma obra. Peguei bem as referencias, fiquei feliz com isso kkkkkkkkkk; os pontos negativos ficam em alguns planos q se alongam demais como a pr√≥pria fuga do Thomas Hutter dentro do castelo do orlok e uma fuga meia boca, ou a chegada dele at√© o castelo, bem paia diga-se de passagem; ou planos que ficam de lado como a vila que fica entre o castelo do conde e o Thomas, q √© pavorosamente podre opini√£o pr√≥pria), e ai vem oq eu mais odiei... o modo como a trilha sonora aumenta desnecessariamente em momentos de tensao onde nao deveria haver tens√£o √© muito chato, e em outras cenas onde s√≥ o silencia bastava, a trilha deixava descarado qua haveria um jump scare safado ali, e isso foi oq mais me agrediu. √â isso gente, super recomendo, bem massa :)"
No Name,1,"Just too dark. The sex scenes were awful 
 Nothing light in the movie
 After a while it was too predictable and too long. Nothing scary. Couldn't get get into the characters. What a disappointment.. The movie depends on gorish scenes to try and shock you. None of it did"
No Name,4.5,"A beautiful, well shot, and well edited movie. Nosferatu is a movie that doesn't require you to do your homework even though it's based on a older film. The plot is laid out in front of you along with the deeper messages are even told to you. The atmosphere created a truly scary movie. Count oarlock's rat like body made me repulsed by him as you should be. The acting was phenomenal from everyone, though Aaron Taylor Johnson's could have been better. This movie is 2 hours of near perfection."
Schiappa L,0.5,One of the worst movies I‚Äôve ever seen in my life!!!
Gage,2,"Great actors, great acting, boring movie."
No Name,5,"The greatest success was to respect the essence of the 1922 expressionist classic, without the need to transport the action to modern times. What is most captivating is the combination of the poetic with the macabre: the shadows, the plague, the madness; not forgetting the monster, who remains in the shadows almost all the time. Fans of the vampire genre will be more than pleased."
No Name,5,"I was sceptic, but in the end, great movie. Will watch again, so many beautiful little details."
No Name,2.5,Great to look at but the story is very standard.  Not sure what the hype is all about.
K K,0.5,Horrible.  Took a long to figure out what was going on. Very dark and sometimes hard to see. Didn't care for the acting. The only saving grace was how creepy the vampire was.
Nick S,4,One of the best movies of 2024!
No Name,5,"Amazing! It's a massive display of artistry from all involved! Direction, cinematography, acting, costume and set design, production. Al at its peak! It may be somewhat slow for modern audiences, and some artistic decisions may be too bold for some, but at the end the passing and the creativity is what elevates this movie!"
Pknow72,3,"Interesting to see how this classic vampire movie was updated and rereleased!!  Hadnt seen the original, but got a kick out of William Defoes performance!!"
No Name,4,"Doesn't come to the level of ""The Lighthouse"" or ""The Northman"", but I had a very good time. It isn't an easy task to keep the public entertained so long with such a baroque theme, but I was glued from start to end. Really great job"
No Name,5,"Most Gothic film I've ever seen, I loved every minute. You can just sit there for 2 hours and look at it, it's so beautifully shot. Add amazing performances (Lily Rose - who knew??), an incredible script and score, and I wish I could give it 6 stars. Wasn't convinced by Eggers, but this was the film he was born to make. Not long enough, but the home release will fix that!"
No Name,5,"An amazing Job. This director rarely disappoints my taste. The movie story is known by most audience. Everything is extremely grim and malevolent. 

Dont proceed if you have not seen it, i don't want to create expectancies:

I personally found it more similar in certain details and aspects to the original Stoker book than other movie about this topic, especially in the aesthetics of the Vampire and the castle. Overall though is a good re enginering of the Murnau\herzog subject 100%
 
The monster character is absolutly terrifying (voice, look and darkness of appearance) and the whole grim atmosphere is visually stunning.  The Dracula background found in the Coppola movie ( which is a masterpiece)  and in Stoker novel is totally missing in this story which in my opinion reduce the catarthic effect and the awareness of the ancient heritage of the vampire which fills the story with mistery and reverence for the character fierceness and power. Altough, for this fact, the Nosferatu character in this movie is perceived totally soulless  and malevolent, more a power of nature than a former human tainted by power and rage, therefore is in some trait much more scary."
No Name,5,Eggers is a singular talent and this is his best work so far.
No Name,5,"""Nosferatu"" es una obra maestra del cine expresionista que perdura en el tiempo.  La atm√≥sfera inquietante y la magistral interpretaci√≥n del vampiro crean una experiencia inolvidable.  Las im√°genes y la m√∫sica se combinan para generar una tensi√≥n constante que te mantiene al borde del asiento.  Sin duda, esta pel√≠cula es una joya cinematogr√°fica que merece ser vista y apreciada. Recomiendo ampliamente ""Nosferatu"" a todos los amantes del cine del terror."
No Name,5,"Debes verla en el cine, excelente adaptaci√≥n moderna del cl√°sico"
No Name,5,Its pretty much dracula. If you know that story you'll know the plot beats. But its a great story. So its a great movie. Very atmospheric. Well acted. Hoping it does well at the box office
Darrell,0.5,Wish I could give a quarter star big disappointment for a first movie date would definitely not recommend unless your trying to find a film either 1 to fall asleep to or 2 just trying to find a quiet spot to make out with your significant other haha no thanks. The popcorn was old haha thank god I had some good company
Carlos,1,is bad movie to long and the ridiculous end. don't waste your money
Eric,3,"Beautiful cinematography, and acting. Character arc, and storylines could definitely use a little improving."
Jorge,5,overall great movie. worth a watch
Ares,5,"Best movie I‚Äôve seen of 2025, 10 out of 10 loved every aspect of it. The horror"
Danny A,5,A gothic version of paranormal
Karla,4,Kind of a slow burner but the acting and cinematography was beautiful. You have to really pay attention in order to understand what‚Äôs going on.
Gloria  N,0.5,Worst movie ever I would have to say and wish I could get my money and time back
wasted my night,0.5,"Sooooo bad and boringggggg, I was expecting so much more from these actors."
No Name,0.5,"What pompous drivel! If you have no redeemable characters,  derivative plot points that contribute nothing to a drawn out script. No amount of costumes and atmosphere can make for a good movie. This IS NOT a good movie. It's  simply another remake."
the rats from nosferatu,5,"i‚Äôve never wanted nick so in love and devoted, need that twink badly. also great movie, def recommend lol."
Tim O,0.5,"Garbage.  So so so slow and boring.  Ever see beam stokers Dracula?  Same movie, just 99% worse. No scares, no suspense, just boring. Was looking at my watch the second half."
Burke T,4.5,A deliciously gothic throwback.
Mark,1,One of the rare movies I see in theater and do not enjoy.
Tiffany,0.5,Literally awful. Would not recommend.
No Name,2.5,"Hard to take seriously and the color is too dark, too blue. I think it's Eggers' weakest movie yet (I liked Northman & VVitch; Lighthouse was interesting). This was more of a chore to sit thru. Willem Dafoe did a good job. From a standpoint of color, I think Eggers would benefit from examining a movie like Phantom Thread which is vibrant in it's delivery yet maintains darkness in it's themes."
not a hater,2.5,Movie was generally good but unnecessarily long in certain scenes and freaky more than scary lol
Chris,4.5,Great movie. A great adaptation of Dracula
Anon.,1,It was a very confusing plot line to follow with many unnecessary scenes. Some of the whispered lines were difficult to understand.
No Name,3.5,"Having never seen the original, I think this movie has a lot of intensity, it is very in your face but the movie is old  and I think this remake it really didn't do much for me except display intense scenes. I would compare it to Sleepy Hallow."
Nosy Rat,5,Its not common for such an iconic film as Nosferatu to have a remake thats as good as this.
Robert M,1,I had really high hopes for the second Nosferatu remake. The original was a stylized masterpiece. The Herzog remake was incredible and arguably better. This version was a mess. Not recommended.
Silver,4.5,"If youre into classics, this is a solid take on Nosferatu. In terms of story, it feels very classical. It is a good change from more modern horror movies. With moments that are definitely suited more for an audience 100 years after the original, it fuses well in order to capture the intense fear of the monster.
The cinematography was used excellently in order to adapt it more to a modern audience. The costume design for both Nosferatu and for the characters was well done, very polished. They bring out a stark contrast of the antagonist and the protagonist is seen clearly. The lighting is kept dark but not too dark in the scenes."
No Name,1.5,A vampire with Moustache?. A dark film that is not in the top level of Dracula by Bran stoker
Clayton,2,Movie was nasty asf brah
No Name,1,I thought it was a terrible movie....only thing I enjoyed was  seeing the cats around in different scenes. Left early.....
Ashley,5,Cinematography was perfectly on point
Ryan G,2,Didnt flow well in my opinion. It was hard to follow
No Name,0.5,What the actual f was that.
No Name,5,"One of the best movies I have seen in years.  It feels like no expense has been spared when making this move, and the effort to ensure the storytelling is accurate to the mythology and folklore‚Ä¶. Is something modern cinema seems to have forgotten. Acting and casting is perfection, cinematography is next level, you are just captured into the story, it is horrifying and definitely not for the feint hearted but I can see where the director wanted to take this story, and every twist and turn had a purpose.  My husband is Bulgarian and the accuracy of the portrayal of Transylvania was ‚Äòon point‚Äô 
While I am sad that they didn‚Äôt make Bill Skarsgard a slightly more attractive vampire with less maggots  (I am ultimately a die hard fan of the 1992 Dracula and would have happily accepted a tragic love story) I can appreciate the return of the ‚Äòscary vampire‚Äô. 
This should be up for an academy award.  At least for cinematography at a minimum."
S,0.5,"soo bad, extremely boring the worst movie üò©"
AW,2,No plot. Just gore and sex.
Ben Grubb,3.5,Cinematography was beautiful but the storyline was lacking and disjointed
Lana,3,I felt the movie was flat. There wasnt enough personality development for the characters and not enough was revealed about the vampire.
Rob E,5,I thought it was properly creepy. It was not a simply reboot of the original but a completely new interpretation to enjoy. Cinematography was on point and made it so easy to get drawn into the period.
Beverly,4,That demon was summoned then all hell broke loose. Now I cannot sleep for a week
Collie,0.5,Stupid - waste of money - rats were never part of any vampire type movie
No Name,4.5,"The movie is better than trailers & teasers. Also, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's 2024: Worst ""Kraven the hunter"" Best ""Nosferatu"""
LilyT,0.5,"BORING!  Kept checking my watch, as did the person I went with.  Got tired of the fake seizures and eyes rolling back in the sockets.  It was lame."
No Name,1.5,"This movie was boring, cringy and overall just gross. It felt like nothing happened untill the end. I wish i could get my money back lol"
Kevin K,1,This is literally Dracula. Plagiarism.
No Name,3,"The creature itself was not scary at all, it rather looked like an old man with a skin disease. Not up to the quality of other Robert eggers ventures."
No Name,4,"Striking visuals, immersive audio, and downright creepy, I recommend you see Nosferatu on the big screen while you can. I guarantee you will be disturbed. This is a great horror picture."
No Name,1.5,"It‚Äôs not often I make a review unless it‚Äôs a movie I really loved. But this one was so bad, I really had to write about it. 
The cast was frankly wasted on this film. 
They did as well as they could. 
The cinematography was great. The score was great‚Ä¶.and that‚Äôs where the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ends. 
For a two hour movie, very little story is given while somehow hammering over the same points that you still don‚Äôt understand. 
Some parts were sped through while others went so long, I almost fell asleep. 
The ending was the very anticlimactic for literally ending in a climax. 
This is twilight with more sexual tension and less plot. And more non consensual. 
I am bummed i wasted a gift card on the tickets"
kimberly s,1,Was so bad didnt even deserve 1
No Name,2.5,"Overwrought, underwhelming, not even close to as intriguing as the original. And my god, for those of us with Misophonia, WTF was with the constant heavy breathing by more than one actor??? So distracting and unnecessary."
Muna Hussein,0.5,I wish I could give 0 stars
Hilda,3,"A lot like Bram Stokers Dracula  but not as good, and when did Nosferatu have a mustache? That was ridiculous."
No Name,2,"I‚Äôm not sure how critics can rave about Lilly Rose Depp‚Äôs acting, I thought it was awful, along with everyone bar Willem Defoe who always holds his own. Everything felt hammy and over acted and it continually pulled me away from being immersed. All the shaking and raving felt really inauthentic. 
I have been looking forward to this film for a long time. A huge fan of The Witch and The Lighthouse, I was worried about how Nosferatu would turn out as  I thought The Northman was terrible. I think Nosferatu is better but not Eggars‚Äô best. 
Funnily enough I kinda liked Orlok‚Äôs moustache - I felt it gave an interesting twist that felt quite authentic to the period - its oddness helped the character. But I think Orlok had too many lines, he became perhaps a bit too obvious. I had hoped it would have some of the weirdness of the Lighthouse and The Witch, but I felt the whole thing was too predictably gothic. I was never surprised nor intrigued by it. In fact I almost gave up and left which is super rare for me. I stuck it out but came away disappointed. Not that I could do any better!! Oh well."
Pam,4,Stayed true to other Dracula films.  All the acting performances were top notch.
BK,0.5,"Boring movie, the vampire looked like a deranged version of Jim Carrey in Sonic the Hedgehog, with an absolutely ridiculous accent."
No Name,1,"Couldn't really commit to it's own style, nosferatu was 90% gurning and spent so long to give so little."
No Name,2,"I was really looking forward to seeing this at the cinema after reading the reviews. However I'm left hollow and disappointed.
It was more Downton Abbey than vampire horror. Very little gore, nothing to make you jump and it just started dragging on and I found myself looking at my watch willing it to be over. Weird nips too."
No Name,0.5,The embodiment of Freud‚Äôs view on women
Bri,5,Beautiful remake that respected the original film while still enhancing the story !
No Name,4.5,"Do not..... go to see.... this movie.... on your own... or, without... a Thesaurus.... like I did."
No Name,3.5,"Another Eggers epic‚Ä¶its egregiously exaggerated and polished trademark style is on full display once again here, which is admittedly beautiful, particularly in its moments involving natural cinematography, but the substance here is fairly rudimentary, though done in a commendably vivid, almost realistic. manner despite its fairytale origins. Overall an effective piece of work for what it intends to do, but not one that leaves much emotional mark. Seeing Lily-Rose Depp‚Äôs performance was memorable, though. She has great talent, undoubtedly. At times her acting did feel melodramatic (not just her‚Äôs either)‚Ä¶.though that may be at least somewhat intentional, per directorial instructions, I speculate, in keeping with the rest of the film‚Äôs choices in artistic style/production. 3.5 stars out of 5 stars"
No Name,5,"Creepy, visually stunning and altogether a fantastic watch. Just enough jump scares to keep you on your toes without overdoing it!"
John D,5,"Great redo of the classic movie based  on Stokers classic book! Beautiful cinematography with fabulous low light scenes in b/w, Acting is very good and the soundtrack is beautiful. My friends and I enjoyed it very much"
No Name,5,This is the exact vibe I want from a vampire flick. A hypnotic fever dream filled with fear and dread. Beautifully designed and shot.  Eggers strikes again!
No Name,5,Ambienta√ß√£o fant√°stica e imersiva nota 10
No Name,5,"Such a well made movie. Beautiful scenes. Amazing acting, Lilys performance gave me chills. First time in years I actually had a real cinematic experience at the cinema and was blown away! 11/10"
No Name,3.5,"An engrossing gothic tale, with great acting all around. The performances draw you in, particularly the portrayal of the hideous vampire, which is both chilling and compelling‚Äîdefinitely not easy to pull off. The imagery is striking, with excellent use of light and shadow that enhances the eerie atmosphere. The story is well-crafted, keeping you hooked from start to finish. It‚Äôs a perfect blend of strong performances and a gripping storyline- i well worth a watch!"
No Name,4,"Definitely a choice! The main actress did a phenomenal job as well as Hoult. Kudos to the director for this fantastic movie, the cinematography was on top!!! 4 stars just because at some parts it was repetitive but overall an incredible horror fantasy movie!!!"
No Name,2.5,Visually stunning but plot worked better as a silent ‚Äúexpressionist‚Äù film. Effects were often used in poor ways with no real impact and Bill Skarsgards Count Orlok looks like Dr. Eggman. I don‚Äôt know who thought the mustache and blonde combover was a good idea. Should‚Äôve just watched Sonic 3. Main highlight was Willem Dafoe‚Äôs performance.
DC,4,"Great acting, sets and direction but the story and ending were not very original."
No Name,5,It's the movie that Dracula should have been all along. It's the one you've waited your whole life to see.
Shannon,4.5,Actually was a pretty good movie I didnt have high expectations for it but it was actually really good.
No Name,5,Absolutely remarkable! Not another absurd jumpscare movie.
No Name,5,"I hate watching movies And wasting my time if I don‚Äôt like them, but when I tell you, I could sit down and watch this movie over and over and over from the places where it was filmed and how the movie was edited in the acting was just all spectacular. I can‚Äôt even explain how much I love this movie if I could give Nosferatu more stars, I would. 10 across the whole board, I recommend watching this If you‚Äôre sick and tired of how Movies are being done today because this is mind-blowing!!!!"
No Name,4,"Stunning cinematography, though you‚Äôll find little in the way of new storylines if you‚Äôre familiar with Stoker‚Äôs tale or Coppola‚Äôs take on it."
Walter V,5,Outstanding cinematography and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire movie. Love the choice of aesthetics for the vampire.
No Name,1.5,"Its very pretty, it has some great performances.....but boy is it dull. It embraces neither the horror nor the erotisism of the vampire mythos and instead replaces it with 2 hours of overlong wannabe-arthouse shots and people putting on farcical accents."
Davids at your mom's house,5,"MUST WATCH! Absolutely stunning in visuals, acting, dark horror gothic style masterpiece. It's definitely a win for the books and if your a true horror fan you'll love this film because it delivers just that. I walked in with a blank mindset and after seeing it in IMAX was just amazed at how well done this movie was brought to the audience with its dark blood and romance built in the right areas you are left in awe."
N/A,1,Not for me at all! It was sexually weird at the beginning so we left
TuckerThaTurtle,4,Puss n Blood Perfection!
Mike,2,Same old story   Hard to hear.
No Name,5,"My expectations were quite high and I can say I was not disappointed. The imagery is spectacular, the tone is dark and haunting, the acting is amazing. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The depiction of Transylvania is accurate, I enjoyed the fact that it included Romanian and Romani folklore as well. If you are a gothic enthusiast, I say this movie is for you!"
No Name,1,"The best thing about this movie is how it captures the time period. The second best thing is the acting. The story, dialogue, and plot not good. Not original. It's like I've watched this movie before and perverse in a way that's unnecessary, and those scenes did not drive the story forward. I guess he can do that, it's his movie. The witch was his best film and probably one of his lowest budgets. I can't recommend this. Big disappointment."
No Name,5,Once again Robert Eggers proves why he is one of the best filmmakers working today.
manolo,4,"a consistent sense of dread permeates every frame of this masterfully made film. really cool transitions between scenes, very dynamic camera work, and haunting imagery linger far beyond the end credits"
Stephen K,2,"It definitely showed the dark side of this story. I thought there were lapses in the plot and it was way too long, I almost left 3/4 of the way through."
Mike A,4,Beautifully shot.  Might have a plot hole or two.
No Name,2.5,"The movie is enjoyable and has a good gothic atmosphere, with some jump scare moments that give you a couple of good tremors. The plot has some holes and an unnecessary sexual drift."
No Name,5,"The movie has that Eggers style in each scene while maintaining the aspects of Dracula‚Äôs story that everyone knows. It may suffer from a surpirse factor since this story lacks originality due to the several iterations throughout the years, but Bill Skaarsgard‚Äôs performance and Lily-Rose Depp‚Äôs ability to transmit suffering and sexuality makes it one of the best horror movies of last year."
No Name,2,"A very pretty disappointment.  A beautifully painted egg with nothing inside, overloaded with superficial drama and limp horror.  Don't waste money at a theatre for this one-watch fumble."
No Name,4,"I might need to watch this again for it to earn its last star, this film is either brilliant or just a bit too draggy on. 

The Atmosphere and Photography is amazing!

Orlok, however, is just no where near as scary as the 20s version, which is a real shame‚Ä¶. I think the story could have been a little different‚Ä¶. you are watching a copy of a knock off version of Dracula, after all. 

Still definitely worth watching, the best horror I‚Äôve seen in quite some time."
Kam,4,"Great cinematography, acting, sound design. Overall great movie. Story just a little hard to follow at times. Still with that flaw one of the best horror movies I‚Äôve seen in theaters in a very long time and my new favorite vampire film."
No Name,4,"Nosferatu is a beguiling and thought-provoking, ranking among the best Dracula adaptations ever made.¬† Recommended.
detroitcineaste"
No Name,1,It‚Äôs a such poor movie good actors good intentions but that‚Äôs it.
No Name,5,"Absolutely brilliant.

Good luck making a vampire movie for the next decade‚Äînothing will compare to what Robert Eggers has crafted. It‚Äôs not just the best vampire movie ever made; it‚Äôs an incredible film, period.

Every frame drips with dread and beauty, paired with magnetic performances and a haunting score. This isn‚Äôt just a reimagining; it‚Äôs the definitive version."
No Name,2,"la pel√≠cula en cuanto actores y efectos especiales y producci√≥n es un 10, pero la historia y el contexto que te dan en muy aburrida, es exceso de actos sexuales en la pel√≠cula se ven muy forzados y por ende varias cosas de la pel√≠cula parecen muy repetitivas como los escrimers qu√© nada m√°s son 2.
en conclusi√≥n si quieres ver una pel√≠cula donde cogen a cada rato esta pel√≠cula es un 10 si buscas una pel√≠cula que te deje sin dormir busca en otro lado."
Frank,5,"Very well done. One of the rare occasions where not only is justice done to the original, but it may have been improved on."
No Name,0.5,What a waste of time . Meaningless is an understatement. Boring AF
No Name,0.5,Pure garbage; if it weren‚Äôt for the super comfy recliner seats I would have walked out.
No Name,5,"Definitely worth a good watch, all actors went all out and showed off some of their greatest talents. 
Nudity is somewhat prominent throughout the 2-3 hours but it's all needed to show off the power dynamics between the victims and nosferatu and isn't just there for the sake of it."
Serge K,1,No sir. Didn't like it!
Cole Thompson,3,This movie did good in terms of the acting and the visuals. But it didn't live up to it's hype for me.
No Name,2.5,"Technically impressive, but characters about as deep as a sheet of paper."
Teresa Steele,1,Horrible parallel to Brams Stokers Dracula. Very disappointing. I wanted to like it. My family hated it.
K B,2,Its hard to understand when they are speaking. Seemed more like it should be a play not a movie. Its long and boring
No Name,5,"Thomas Hutter √© um jovem corretor de im√≥veis, rec√©m-casado, que recebe a miss√£o de viajar para a Rom√™nia para se encontrar com um cliente, o Conde Orlok, que deseja comprar uma propriedade na cidade onde o corretor mora. A sua esposa, Ellen, pede para ele n√£o ir, mas aquele neg√≥cio seria o in√≠cio de progresso dentro da firma. O que Thomas n√£o sabe √© que Orlok tem outros interesses na cidade. Baseado no roteiro do filme de 1922 de F. W.  Murnau e era uma adapta√ß√£o n√£o autorizada do livro de Bram Stoker, Dr√°cula. Para n√£o ter problemas com a fam√≠lia de Stoker, eles mudaram os nomes dos personagens, mas muitas das situa√ß√µes do livro, se repete no filme. Robert Eggers atualiza o filme de Murnau, mas mant√©m muita coisa do cl√°ssico de 1922. Se o Conde Orlok de Max Schreck era estranho e o de Klaus Kinski, at√© repulsivo, o interpretado por Bill Skarsgraad √© amedrontador. Ele √© maior que os outros anteriores, o que o torna mais aterrador. Parab√©ns a Skarsgraad pelo excelente trabalho f√≠sico. Tamb√©m √© de se elogiar a bela fotografia, o figurino, o design de produ√ß√£o, a maquiagem (tanto de √©poca como a de Orlok) e a reconstitui√ß√£o de √©poca, inclusive no roteiro, que usa do modo de falar da √©poca onde o filme passa. Eggers constr√≥i aqui um conto g√≥tico excepcional. Ele mant√©m o ar de terror cl√°ssico, mas faz jump scares, mostra sangue e ratos sem pudor. O elenco est√° muito bem, mas o destaque √© Willem Dafoe, que faz o Professor Franz, o doppelganger do Van Helsing de Stoker. Nosferatu encerra 2024 com chave de ouro, como um novo cl√°ssico do terror."
No Name,1,This movie sucks. It made me so mad
Charles,3,More horrific and disgusting than anything else. Not much of a story here.
Gee,0.5,Trash and demonic . Walked out on this bs
Jared,5,Very good and interesting better than sparkles and furry
Nelson,2,I didn‚Äôt know what was happening most of the time jajaja
Cris,0.5,Terrible. It was basically porn.
No Name,3.5,"This film is a slow burn, while the sets, costumes and feeling of a looming dread are spot on, the acting from the movie's lead female often took me out of the movie. There also seems to be a issue with pacing. There are quite a lot of things in the film that could have been done differently that  would have made this movie a MASTERPIECE but can be overlooked and still a pretty great viewing experience."
No Name,5,Master piece of Rober Eggers
Ryan S,5,"Very unsettling, but really well done"
No Name,0.5,"Watching this movie made me appreciate all the bad movies I‚Äôve seen in 2024. Nosferatu has a combination of lackluster acting and a subpar plot. It gives the idea of middle schoolers making a school project. Saw this at my job for free and still feel like I‚Äôm still owed my money back!! With that said, if you're someone that likes slow, boring movies and has low standards, then this is the movie for you!!"
Jesus,5,Great movie. Enjoyed jt
Nick M,0.5,If I could give it less stars I would. Garbage show. Slow. Boring. Lifeless. If the goal was to bring the audience to yawns then it succeeded.
Yvonne O,0.5,"So long, so slow, so meaningless."
No Name,1,"If you want to see Dracula from Bram Stocker you should see the original one; lots of paralelisms, left the movie befare was ending."
felipelucero,2.5,Too long & filmed way too dark.
Akash,5,The best horror movie of the year!
Robert F,1.5,"A movie trying to be something but does not succeed. Great visuals, great actors, great idea, poor storytelling, poor script, way too much time showing hand shadows.  What a shame. What a waste of time and talent, etc.,"
No Name,4,"Dark, gothic & incredibly well developed. This was a really good movie"
Petelogical,3,"While I think it was shot really well, and that it‚Äôs a good film. Aaron Taylor Johnson, Nicholas Hoult, and Bill Skarsgaard delivered incredible performances on screen, I wish it wasn‚Äôt so cut and pasted from Dracula and did something new with the source material. It also felt long for a 2 1/2 hr movie. Might be worth a view if you‚Äôre a diehard Nosferatu or Dracula fan, but if not you could wait to stream it"
Thomas S,1,Horrible acting. More funny than scary.
Celina S,3,"Long movie with a slow storyline. Not what I thought it would be. Not bad, but not a favorite. I'm glad I saw it but wouldn't recommend it to friends and family."
Google,3,The story itself was very thin. But I respect what Eggers tried to do here.
Gary L,2,"If you are going to make another version of a story that has had dozens of movies made about it, you need to have something unique to offer or an outstanding presentation. Nasferatu (2024) has neither. 

Positives: Atmosphere, some good casting and acting, a unique visual representation of Dracula (a very Slavic look).
Negatives: not a scary moment in the movie, a subpar retelling of the Dracula story, William Defoe's role (I'm a big fan, but this was terrible role for him), everything was completely predictable (thus, nothing unique), and a terrible ending.

I wouldn't call this a terrible movie as it is based on a classic story, I would call it a lame movie, a movie that added nothing to the telling of this tale. Overall I found it to be just boring."
Cary,1,I left. It was boring.
Elliott,3,"This was my first Robert Eggers film. I think the movie was well acted, well directed, and well cast. My issues are not with the performance, but the plot conclusions. It is a good movie, but it is not for me. I won't be watching it a second time."
Blood sucking or just sucks...,1,"Very slow to start and never really picks up. Sometimes you could not even make out what the actors were saying due to very thick accents. First vampire movie that did not make me jump out of my seat, not even once. Very disappointed to say the least."
Fernando S,2,Very hard to understand the Vampire character and the movie drags on without much excitement. Its very gory not scary.
No Name,1.5,"Overall, the film felt dull and uninspired. The most disappointing element was Nosferatu‚Äôs voice, which came across as more comedic than unsettling due to its loudness and exaggerated accent. 

The choice to give Nosferatu a mustache was another misstep, as it added to the comedic appearance and obscured the teeth and mouth‚Äîfeatures that should be the most striking and unsettling aspects of a vampire. 

It‚Äôs surprising that the same director behind the brilliant 2015 film, The Witch, was responsible for this."
No Name,3,Richly depicted and notable performances. Some scenes were dull or awkward.
andrew Reyes,4,It was like wow but I love the shots it was something out of a painting I was there to support Chris Columbus because I just sent a script to him.
No Name,2.5,"I loved the costumes and the atmosphere of the movie, but overall, I think the story and characters fell flat. Many parts were overly sensational rather than focused to the motivations of each person. It lacked the sensual, calm, and mystery components that other versions of Nosferatu or Dracula have done in the past. I think Ellen was especially confusing, because her role in the relationship with Nosferatu seemed to be active in the first half, but towards the end it felt like it was very passive? And the ending felt graphic for no reason rather than going back to what Nosferatu symbolizes. I think there was truly so much potential for better storytelling but it got caught up in the weeds of trying to make certain parts shocking."
No Name,1,"If you want to experience claustrophobia, followed by depression, with a finale of disgust, then this film is the one for you.  No real character development...no real plot...just a 2 1/2 hour nasty drag through a stinking sewer of Victorian bestiality.  The only impression made on me was the notion that good girls have sexual fantasies about really big dogs.  I really couldn't wait to get out of the theatre and have a cigarette.  What a waste of time and money.  I should have listened to my horror movie fanatic brother who warned me this would happen."
SP,4,"Good acting, plot, don‚Äôt loose interest."
Brian N,5,Beautiful cinematic masterpiece. It draws the viewer in by the throat and doesnt let go.
No Name,1,"Long, slow, boring. The hammer films were so much better than this drivel. It proves great cinematography can't make a film better by itself."
No Name,2.5,"There were a few cool scenes, but this movie was not scary at all and was pretty boring most of the time. Definitely not worth rewatching."
No Name,1.5,"I‚Äôm pretty open minded and was excited for this film. However, the build up wasn‚Äôt there and I didn‚Äôt find it creative; and it was too dark and hard to see (as in they used a candle as the main light source the whole movie). The main character basically sleeps with a vampire who looked like Waluigi from Nintendo to save the town. Ultimately, for a lack of better words; this movie was lame!"
Toi,4.5,Love this movie...so dark and classic
No Name,1,"Zero characters development. Hell, to the people who has never read the bram stoker book like my wife wouldn't even know who the hell is the character ""Knock"" is. The CGI at the end with the shrunken body is laughable. The cinematographer never once give a clear image of Orlok. I should have just stayed home and rewatch bram stoker's Dracula...."
Gary P,3.5,"This was a good movie and worth watching, but that is the extent of it. It is good, but not amazing."
mark s,4,"A classic move made for the next generation. This movie is intense, you ultimately know what's going to happen at the end, but the journey to get there is a wonderful re-telling. The film is beautifully shot and the acting is great by the cast."
No Name,2,"I liked Lighthouse and Witch but I expected more from Nosferatu, given the ""best horror film ever made"" hype. It sticks too close to its source material to be interesting 100 years on. Nosferatu himself isn't frightening, which is also a big problem; with Cossack moustache and oversize dong, he looks like some stereotype of Rasputin with elderly Howard Hughes nails, and his slow gravelly voice gets hilarious in its illegibility during extended dialogue sequences. The Knock character, aka Renfield, still serves no purpose and feels totally irrelevant to the plot's progression. Another issue is the music. Soundtrack is key for good horror, and the score is just not at the creep level set by Popol Vuh for Herzog's remake; leaving the theater, I had a hard time even remembering what it sounded like. As for the performances, the actors were all fine, no complaints there. The style and look of the film is super dark and other worldly, and I admire the director's emphasis on Eastern European myths as the foundation. I just wish it had taken more chances. Given Eggers abilities as a writer, he should have been more willing to dismantle the main narrative for his own purposes and craft something stronger and less overwrought Victorian. But I realize the minute you do that, people will gripe that you've changed it."
No Name,3,"Freddy Mercury is back as Dracula.. If they havent shown the face of Nosferatu, the movie would been better."
Chris,4.5,Super well made. A bit simple
No Name,0.5,"The poorest of all R.Eggers movies so far, greatly dissapointed from the acting and the poorly glued story.
The art through movies is completely dead swallowed by the money making industry and the masses apetite for cheap art."
No Name,5,"I joked about seeing this movie on it's Christmas release date but waited until January 5th and it wasn't a joke. It blew me away. So many shots in this movie could be framed peices of art. The culture of 1838 was thick but the language was clear enough that you could understand everything.

The story was incredibly simple but the subtle influence of the villain was, well, it's hard to describe. There were no spoon-fed explainations to the audience. Instead everything was shown with sound, color and distortion. They made you feel the vampire's presence sitting there in your seat. And once they had you, they twisted you like a wet rag.

I want to complain about the ending but like those under the creature's influence, I can't. I wanted a different ending, a more modern ending but that wouldn't have worked, not for this movie. I haven't seen the original Nosferatu but you can taste it in this work of art. It's not like other movies today."
Gregory M,5,Fantastic version of this classic! Amazing acting and cinematography!
No Name,2.5,"I really enjoy psychological horror and enjoyed Egger's the VVitch for its eerie and serious tone. His Nosferatu was kitschy in comparison. I couldn't tell if it was trying to be serious or funny, as there were parts that were genuinely hilarious (e.g.  Knock running naked down the street after escaping, Orlock saying to Thomas ""we will be neighbours"" in his growly voice, and the silhouette with his hands at the end).

This movie really felt like it couldn't figure out what it wanted to be. It left the viewer feeling confused at the cognitive dissonance, and robbed the movie of any genuine scares or true disconcertedness. There were some parts that were gross, making you go ""eugh"", but genuinely scary? Hard pass. It's almost like an edgy teenager was writing this, because it felt like they were trying very hard to do the most shocking thing you could imagine in some scenes.  But the key word there is ""try hard"". This movie was very that. 

On top of that, the characters were one dimensional and overdramatic, the plot was both modern (deranged sex scenes) and outdated (keeping the premise of Orlock buying real estate, which led to the element of hilarity again), and in parts didn't make sense or was confusing. It wasn't clear to me why Orlock was obsessed with Ellen, it seemed like some ambiguous, shaky plotline that they decided to not embellish on because they couldnt come up with anything. Overall, this meant you didn't really care for their plight. I was happy when certain characters died. 

I admit I did enjoy parts of it, I was able to keep my attention throughout the movie and wanted to know to some degree what happened. I was able to enjoy good conversation about it after, and had some good laughs throughout at its ridiculous. It fell short of being a horror by far, but I am enjoying the memes coming from it. Hence, 2.5/5"
No Name,3,Not bad but I wish it would‚Äôve had a happy ending.
Jon,4,"Beautiful Cinematography! Not surprising, it was shot on 35mm film."
No Name,0.5,Very bad story and even worst storytelling
Michele P,5,The movie was very impressive! A classic updated to the new horror style. The main female actor‚Äôs performance was amazing. It got me tense all the time.
No Name,5,"This was a movie for people who loved and understood the original silent film.  The locations, the costumes, the casting were all excellent.  I found Count Orlock to be the most disturbing vampire ever, nothing sexy or romantic about him--which is exactly how he should have been portrayed.  He was the rotting corpse of an antique Romanian nobleman.  I felt all the acting was superb and especially enjoyed Dafoe.  Not a movie for modern audiences who need constant excitement and explosions to maintain interest.  It is slow moving, stately, and dream-like in many parts.  I was completely repelled and completely satisfied by the film.  A challenging experience and one I'm glad I had."
Hannah B,5,"Really well made movie, great performances by all of  the cast"
No Name,0.5,Had been excited all year for this.  One of the most disappointing cinematic experiences of my life.
Mary Croft,3,I thought the scenery was beautiful and the wardrobe of the cast was wonderful!
No Name,5,"It was beautiful cinematography, the acting was insane and the plot always kept you on edge. I am not a film girl but this is one of the best I‚Äôve seen"
No Name,4,"Filmul este foarte interesant, √ÆnsƒÉ lucrurile se √Ænt√¢mplƒÉ foarte repede din punctul meu de vedere.
Povestea curge √Æn direc»õia care pare evidenta, as fi vrut ceva care sa ma surprindƒÉ mai mult. 
√éi dau 80 %"
No Name,0.5,This movie was by far the worst movie I have seen in a VERY long time.
No Name,2.5,"I spent the film umming and ahhhing as to whether I was enjoying it or impressed with it. Stylistically grandiose and at times atmospherically brilliant but maybe it was some of the overly laboured and over acted persistent melodrama that rendered the whole thing hollow (particularly the female lead who at times was just theatrical and unconvincing). I felt detached from the film, rather than engrossed by it. Deserving an Academy award for costumes and sets. It looks the part, it has a fair enough plot but just eurgh its kind of flat. Watched at ODEON Greenwich."
No Name,1,"Dull, overly long and not at all scary..."
gary f,1,So disappointed. Characters never developed so that I cared about them. Seemed film maker was more concerned with cinematic shots reminiscent of the original silent movie Nosferatu than crafting a compelling story
No Name,5,"Amazing cinematography, Bill Skarsgard is unrecognizable and amazing. Best horror movie I‚Äôve ever seen."
No Name,4,"This movie embodies what a horror movie experience is supposed to be.  Is it a perfect movie, no, but it is as perfect as any movie was in 2024."
No Name,5,"Absolutely amazing film, I loved and enjoyed every moment of it and cannot wait for the digital release plus the director's cut!"
Travis B,2,It is hard to follow. It is a long movie. I would not go see it again.  The actors are great but storyline is not good.
No Name,4.5,"Visually stunning, extremely entertaining and graphic but not scary, though the cynic in me wanted to laugh out loud at the moments of almost Pantomime/Hammer Horror dialogue. Don't let me put you off though."
Rebecca,3,"It was very theatrical. Almost like a play, less like a movie, It was kinda slow and he wasnt very scary. He sounded scary but he looks kinda cheesy."
No Name,1.5,Animation is a little bad. The story is not the best!!
No Name,4.5,"Excellent, it lives up to the hype. Something terribly annoying though: the sound mixers screwed up the audio. The music and sound effects are at 100%, but when you're in the theatre the dialogue sounds like it's at 60% volume. sit mid-way through in the theatre, or closer.

Depp's daughter's actually not bad. Orlok's pretty formidable, but it was a mistake giving him a mustache. It obscures his facial expressions."
A.J. Folino III,5,I loved how the plot thickened throughout the movie the soundtrack was very ominous and worked well with some of the jump-scares. Everyone in the cast did phenomenal! I'm going to see it a second time to appreciate it again and/or catch things I may have missed the first time I saw it.
Kat P,5,"Absolutely beautiful. If you love gothic vampire lore, you will not be disappointed."
David K,5,"Fantastic movie. Beautifully shot, well paced, tense, scary atmosphere."
Michael J,2,"The movie had all of the right things but watching it was like trying to drive uphill with the emergency break on. That was bad enough, then the end of the movie was dumb. Save your money and watch it on Netflix."
No Name,5,"Some may have viewed the trailers and expected a more modern jump-scare packed horror flick, but this film executes a style of horror film that relies on the genuinely horrific for its scares. It's the type of horror and pacing seen in classics like The Exorcist that some audiences find boring, but allow yourself to be thrust back to 1800 Transylvania, you will not be disappointed. Amazing performances from the all the cast.  Going to watch it again at the 35mm screening at the Glasgow Film Theatre!"
Victor,1,Great cinematography but no substance. Felt empty at the end. Don't waste your money or time
Brian,5,"A fun, creepy ode to classic horror films that feels ramped-up with fantastic cinematic effects and top level performances from a stellar ensemble."
Sarah B,4.5,Cinematically stunning.
No Name,0.5,What an absolute waste of time. I am a huge horror fan and have been waiting to see this since it was announced. The first act makes you think it is going to be great and then it falls flat on it's face. The pacing is terribly slow and as it drags on you realize you are wasting your time and money. Not to mention the ending is so unbelievably bad the entire audience in our theatre was laughing out loud. Watch this at home when it's streaming to help put you to sleep.
No Name,5,"Excelente fotografia, trilha sonora e atua√ß√£o. O filme explora um romance abusivo, atormentador e repugnante de uma forma explendida! Com refer√™ncias cient√≠ficas e m√≠ticas de √©poca, Nosferatu (2024) √© uma obra prima para os amantes de cinema, literatura e terror. N√£o esperem um filme que se apoia no jump scare, antes de mais nada √© um filme que sabe contar uma boa hist√≥ria!"
Becky C,4.5,"This was an intense vampire thriller with great twists on the traditional story. The rats were a creepy new addition!  Willem Dafoe was so good, it was disappointing that the didnt appear until halfway through. It was definitely more gory than expected but really great."
No Name,4,"This movie is great. It's refreshing and very well produced, nearly flawless. The space and plot constructed within it are absolutely amazing and remarkably immersive.

However, there are a few notable things to talk about. At times, the movie contains some quite... childish... moments. From Nosferatu's voice (at least in the Brazillian Portuguese dub) which stands in the line between a nearly-decent attempt at being disturbing and just laughably ironic and cheesy.

Some camera movements/pans are just random and nonsensical. Fine, I get the attempt to recreate the classical film from the 1920s, but it's a little weird and doesn't mix very well.

But that doesn't really matter that much as the movie was masterfully constructed and is very distinctive. I just can't express how amazing of a ride it was. Bravo!"
Matthew E,5,Absolutely one of the greatest horror films I've seen in a long time.
No Name,4.5,"Absolute must-see. Acting incredible, story incredible and setting is incredible"
David,5,Very good movie. Can't wait for the physical release.
No Name,1.5,"This film is essentially a poorly reconstructed skeleton of the Francis  Ford Coppola Dracula remake, only Eggers uses the archetypes from the original Nosferatu film. 

Much has been made of the brilliant cinematography, but there are many horror films that look a lot like this one. 

The characters are under developed, the scenes that are meant to be scary/creepy are overacted and laughable. It‚Äôs a good film to watch with friends and crack jokes at, but not much more. 

All ‚Äústyle‚Äù, no substance. Come for the scares, stay for the lols‚Ä¶ or just see something else honestly."
No Name,3.5,"Nosferatu is done very well; particularly its visuals do the different places justice. Unfortunately, I developed absolutely no sympathy or even compassion for any of the characters and therefore sat there merely admiring the technical excellence. Maybe it‚Äôs just my lack of imagination that‚Äôs spoiling an otherwise excellent movie for me."
No Name,0.5,"This is a risible effort to inject life into the brilliant Nosferatu orginal tale. Wooden acting by the main cast and Willem Dafoe just seemed like a pantomime ham. 
Far too long and with nothing to add to the story. Hats off to the wardrobe department who'd done a good job. That's about it in tems of praise. 
The sequence wher the main character arrives at the castle to be met by the locals was so obviously a bunch of extras being ... a bunch of extras. 
The absence of dramatic tension and comedic homages to the shadows of long fingers on walls made the film literally laughable. 
I left having lost over two precious hours of my life."
Cassie,2.5,"I liked the version with Keanu, Reeves and Winona Ryder much better. This movie was OK. The ending was disappointing and I couldve easily waited until it was streaming for free."
No Name,1,Incredibly dull and boring.Good cast but the movie was painfully tedious.
No Name,4,I seen the movie this past weekend with my girlfriend. It was way better than I expected. Bill Skarsg√•rd Did an incredible job
Max T,5,"On of the best horror movie for the holidays!  The acting, music and cinematography are so intense and scary it almost made me pull down my beanie over my eyes!"
No Name,4.5,"While ""The Lighthouse"" will likely remain my personal favorite of his, I'd consider this film to be Eggers' magnum opus as of now ‚Äî it's both his most accessible and most stunningly shot to date. I do hope this adaptation will grow to cement a reputation as a titan of the horror genre."
No Name,0.5,disgusting. period. what the hell???
Homer Pimpson,5,Tbh it‚Äôs kinda rough but if you have a goth gf with short hair and bangs. Piercings and anime or Japanese style tattoos and is Mexican. And has colored and fried their hair while you‚Äôre playing God of War ragnarok for the first time and she‚Äôs having a complete crisis. Then you‚Äôre going to love this movie.
Rachael,0.5,"This movie was so slow moving, yet also felt like you dropped into the middle of the story. The sex scenes we unexpected. I was bored through most of the movie, checking my watch to see how much longer, which is a bummer because I love this genre and the actors involved."
Michael Coxmauts,5,Its just simply beautiful and very entertaining.
Kat B,5,"New take on a classic, scary, suspenseful,  just a touch gory but not too much, and wonderful acting."
David M,4,"A great period piece of art that captures your imagination. The 
Imagery was haunting and captivating. William Defoe was awesome."
cate,5,The top of horror cinematography. Wow!
First L,4,Great details but it dragged at times
Luis,2,First 30-40 minutes was interesting and then the movie just halted to a stop it was a drag until the end. Really cant say too many good things other than some good moments peppered here and there.
melanie.L,5,Very good if you live vampire movies or nosferatu (Dracula) üñ§üåô
boo,5,This movie was clutch
Kenneth H,1,slow and kinda boring
andrew_saldivar,5,The story was so well written and shot so beautifully. It really keeps you in the moment and ‚Äúhooked‚Äù so to speak.
No Name,5,La mejor pel√≠cula me encant√≥ demasiado
Donald S,3,"There was a lot to like about this film, but it was dreadfully slow. And I am saying that as someone who enjoys the ""elevated"" horror genre and quite a bit of Eggers' previous films. I did fall asleep very briefly while watching. Not bad, but kind of meh."
Dennis R,4,Great visuals.  Could have been more suspenseful though.
JH,5,"Best Nosferatu version by a landslide! This version of Nosferatu is eerie and disturbing. I rate this movie on par with Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula 1992 version, maybe even a little better due to superior acting all around (not Keanu‚Äôs best performance) and because it‚Äôs darker and scarier. Definitely, one of my favorite vampire movies."
No Name,2.5,"The pacing was bad and some moments were just awkward versus unsettling. I like some of the changes, the acting, and the aesthetic but the movie wasn't enjoyable to watch. Worth seeing once to compare it to the others. It's my least favorite of the 3 movies and of course the book is king."
Drea,2.5,"I havent seen the original so I went in with no expectations, I thought it was a bit boring. The gothic feel was done beautifully but it felt so slow then rushed at the end. Also the accent for Orlok was HEAVY I honestly couldnt understand half of what he said."
Patricia R,0.5,slow in all over the place
No Name,4,"Classic classic horror, great camera work and directing. Sound was good. Great acting. Longing pace."
Joshua,5,"Even though it was freaky, I think it captured what the original movie had felt like when it came out. Even though people say it's boring, they need to know that this film is a remake of the original from 1922 and that nosferatu is a copy from the novel Dracula, which came out in the late 19th century."
No Name,0.5,"I expected so much more. The visuals were excellent and the vampire‚Äôs voice was perfect, but the movie as a whole fell flat. Too much time spent on the lead female‚Äôs somnabulance. For a horror movie there was very little horror and nothing that raised goosebumps. We both about fell asleep and talked about leaving early. I‚Äôll never watch it again."
No Name,4.5,What's not to like about this quality retelling of one of the most notorious tales of horror ever written.
Adriana,3,"I don‚Äôt know what the hell I just watched, but the acting was amazing"
Brittney C,5,"Such a phenomenal movie!! The acting, the visuals, all beautiful!!! 5 stars across the board!!!!!! Definitely recommend!!!"
Marlis H,4,I went into it without knowing the original story.
J D,5,"A classic Gothic Horror movie that doesn't rely on tons of special effects, gallons of fake blood, and exploding gore, to tell a chilling and heartfelt story. Subtle but intense acting, exquisite sets and costuming, and great film noir style lighting made for a very well done performance."
No Name,0.5,"Boring, old timey English talk. Slow, weird, with a vampire who is really just a straight up freak. Not scary AT ALL. Feels play like"
i_am_belial,5,"loved the cinematography, the acting, and the atmosphere. hella fun!"
No Name,4.5,Very nosferatu very demure
No Name,2,"Honestly, I think it's very very veryyyy overrated. I went to the cinema completly blind and it was boring, confusing (the dialogue) and pointless. The main character wasn't enjoyable and her ""sacrifice"" or whatever she did didn't go nowhere since the most liked character was dead in the end. Also it had a lot of sexual scenes with no point at all.
The only thing I liked was actually the acting. The script is mediocre, but they did a great job with their roles."
No Name,4.5,"Slow, brooding movie that lulls you into a perfect hypnotic trance, delighted by the insanely beautiful and disgusting visceral experience. One of eggers best."
No Name,3,"Nosferatu revels in its stagecraft, so much so that it takes every opportunity to make itself evident, from its disciplined colour palette to its perpetual use of centre framing of its subjects. 

It takes all significant notes of the classic Bram Stoker tale and twists it just a touch, making it just interesting enough a watch, but not wildly or controversially original. But yet, if you are fan of the original novel, there is something for you here."
Jennifer,1.5,"Beautiful cinematography, good acting, very slow-moving plot and weak story."
No Name,3.5,Pretty Good! A nice mix of older style horror movie making with a contemporary spin
Ashley  S,3,"It was ok, the cinematography makes it worth the watch, but a bit sluggish at times"
No Name,4.5,"Yeah it drags on in some scenes, but any vampire nerd/fan would be missing out. The movie is certainly a worthy successor from the original film"
Stephanie S,4,Storyline very similar to original Nosferatu. Acting and special effects was good! Not scary but intense at times.
John Jones III,4,"The film‚Äôs expressionist style and its unrelenting focus on the fear of the unknown make it a timeless experience, leaving a lasting impact on the horror genre. Despite being over a century old, Nosferatu still manages to evoke fear and awe, proving that true horror knows no age. If you're a fan of cinema or the horror genre, Nosferatu is an absolute must-see."
Michael G,2,Found it to be very slow in spots. It was not what I expected and found it to be greatly over hyped.
Scott  D,4,It was a stunning movie but I was expecting more
Jeff,1,Most boring movie with the most anticlimactic ending ever.
Jen E,4.5,"This is one of the most beautiful movies that I've seen.  Many of the scenes are set so they are like lush paintings come to life.  I do enjoy the update to the tale, though the language feels just a bit ... silly (?) at times.  All-in-all a great film!"
No Name,3,"Meh, an average horror film. Yes it looked fabulous, capturing the essence of the original's look and feel, yet modernizing with a well chosen muted colour scheme. However the film itself, when viewed as a standalone, had a horrendously stilted script, and a story so very old fashioned and outdated. I felt no connection or sympathy with any of the characters and the nosferatu character was cartoonish, with an utterly ridiculous accent (and so over done it was often hard to understand what they were actually saying). Had a couple of nice jump scares, and the ending was decent enough, but this is massively over-rated at present on RT."
Samantha S,1,"Nosferatu is not great. Cinematically framed its beautifully shot, in certain scenes, overall it moved at a snails pace with long drawn out empty scenes. 

I get they are paying homage to the silent film era, but Jesus I fell asleep twice. There is gore, which makes sense but in some places is just shock value after 20 minutes of long gray hallways. 

I suppose Im not high art enough to get it."
keith p,5,"Solid movie, acting was great and the visuals weren't fantastic"
Erin,1.5,"Great actors, okay plot, bad pacing, and did not care for the new look of count orlok"
No Name,1,Pants. Really bad. Flat characters. Terrible script. 2 hrs I won't get back
Jose,4,"Very well done, super scary, and weird."

No Name,2.5,Big case of Been there done that. I prefer the Werner Herzog version starring Klaus Kinski really‚Ä¶or even Frank Langella as the Count in the ‚Äò79 Dracula ‚Ä¶.Eggars should stick to original material
Hannah G,5,Best movie I've seen since Speak No Evil
James G,5,"Fantastic visuals, excellent characters, and the variations on the familiar story were great!"
francis r,1.5,Very over the top script while the gothic look and feel of the movie was increditable....I was hard to be invested it felt like a was watching vampire shakespear
Jessica,0.5,Absolutely awful. Waste of time.
kennyleggs89,5,Huge fan of the original well done
Victor  B,0.5,aburrida y el delicioso est muy sabroso
No Name,0.5,"I found it very long, much too loud, and over-the-top melodramatic. Not scary at all. Terrible music and laughable dramatics. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Tempted to walk out."
Andrea W,4,Lots of gore but very good. Acting is great.
No Name,1,Very dated movie. Has a slow pace and a silly plot. Not worth the time.
Brandon W,0.5,"It did not need to be 2.5 hours long. Slow and boring build up to the inevitable conclusion that you all are thinking. Bad acting, bad moustache props, just bleh"
Philip W,5,"If you are a lover of vintage horror cinema or are a fan of FFC‚Äôs Bram Strokers Dracula (1992) then you are going for to love this film. The cinematography, color palate and frame management does more to tell the story than the 19th century English dialogue but it‚Äôs well put together to keep the viewers on edge IMO"
Haley,1,The most boring movie Ive ever watched
No Name,4.5,"Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, it's an old story but it was done very well."
No Name,0.5,horrible movie.  very dark and loud.  can't understand dialogue.  movie drags.
No Name,4,Diferente e Bem dirigido
No Name,1,So boring. Seemed like a low budget movie with a poor plot
David keenan,3,"Well acted, well written a really good film, but Very disturbing. Perhaps too disturbing."
No Name,5,"This film is a masterpiece in every sense. The actors deliver outstanding performances, the cinematography is breathtaking, and every creative decision feels remarkably cohesive. In an era where many directors blend into the background, Eggers stands out with a clear, unified vision. The color palette, shot composition, camera movements, and pacing are all meticulously crafted and work together seamlessly.

The placement of the jumpscares is deliberate. You‚Äôre not caught off guard by them, and that‚Äôs intentional‚Äîit‚Äôs part of the film‚Äôs distinctive style. It follows a traditional yet refined approach, embracing its own canon with precision and purpose.

This is a solid 95% out of 100%. Eggers seems to have drawn inspiration from a variety of sources to shape this iteration of Nosferatu: the original film, Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula, Dungeons & Dragons: Ravenloft, Vampire: The Masquerade, Bloodborne, and possibly more. Whether by coincidence or design, these influences are masterfully interwoven to create something extraordinary.

The atmosphere is nothing short of mesmerizing. It captures an overwhelming sense of tension, immersing you in the weight of its locations and enveloping you in a mood that defies easy description‚Äîit‚Äôs exhilaratingly fresh.

One of the most remarkable aspects is the portrayal of the Count. He isn‚Äôt overdone or flashy. I deeply appreciated that the Count is portrayed as pure darkness‚Äîno glowing eyes, no bizarre sparkling abilities. He embodies raw, unfiltered evil in a gritty, grounded way. Simply phenomenal.

This is the best horror film I‚Äôve seen in years, and I hope it marks the beginning of a renaissance for gothic horror cinema of this caliber.

While personal taste may vary, dismissing this film as ‚Äòboring‚Äô or ‚Äòlow quality‚Äô reveals far more about the viewer than the work itself. 

It takes a certain sensibility to recognize and appreciate the level of detail, passion, and artistry poured into each frame. Those who fail to see it for what it truly is‚Äîa masterwork of gothic horror‚Äîshould perhaps reflect on whether they are equipped to critique such a carefully crafted piece. This is not a film that lacks brilliance; rather, it exposes the limitations of those who cannot grasp it."
Jeannie A,4.5,"Chilling, intelligent acting that kept me at the edge of my seat.  Loved it"
Leslie,3.5,I liked the cinematography and acting. It is the same story line that many people already know.
William E,3,"Beautifully filmed, yet so many scenes close to blackness (a bit too many times).  Is that the scary part?  I tried to love the story but naps rejected any interest."
MDC,3,"Loved the visuals, soundtrack and acting of the characters BUT thought Orlock was way to underwhelming with his look and make uphe wasnt visually frightening enoughmaybe my expectations were too high.  Other than that, good movie!"
Vipin,3,Beautifully shot movie and it was a visual treat even though it was not a colorful movie in anyway. Some of the scenes appeared funny rather than serious and some of the dialog were poorly written and removed the built up tension up until that point. Some even laughed out loud in the theatre.  I had read before going to the movie that the movie was inspired by Dracula but it felt like an exact copy except for the character names and location. Lily Rose did a good job depicting the suffering of the main character.
David W,5,I enjoyed the movie with the story being true to its form.  Not alot of gore but great effects.
Rob B,5,Mind blowing I‚Äôm still processing the film.
Barbara,5,"The acting, makeup, cinematography were stellar. I expect some Oscars for this one!"
No Name,1.5,"This movie could easily be 45 minutes shorter, I went to the bathroom twice while watching it in theatres and missed literally nothing. The scares were cheap, the hauntings got repetitive and the symbolism was not portrayed well either. Costume and set design was great, and I appreciated that the accent was not too corny."
No Name,1,"I am sorry to say, but the only performance that is salvageable is Wilhelm Defoe's. I still prefer the original one with Bela Lugosi; I thought i was going to see a true horror, a modern side of a classic it was sadly only a dark soft porn"
Chris L,2,"Great cinematography, but the character development is near nonexistent. Also fails to explain some plot devices, which makes the ending fall flat."
Ommarsharie,4,"Good, entertaining movie. Gif strange at some points but overall great movie. Wonderful cinematography."
No Name,3.5,"Good movie. However, I still believe Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula (1992) is a superior adaptation with stronger performances. The depth of Gary Oldman‚Äôs portrayal is lacking in Nosferatu. That said, from a visual standpoint, Nosferatu is top-tier. In terms of atmosphere, the movie achieves its goal, though I would have preferred more sensuality in the vampire character."
stacy p,1,Boring as hell and same ol same ol.
Grady B,3,Party of four. We thought it was too long and some scenes could have been deleted. It failed to keep our interest.
Alisa D,0.5,Oh my. The worst movie of the year. Tried really hard to stay awake and watch.  I left early couldn‚Äôt handle this boring movie.
No Name,5,PUES ALCHL ESTA BIEN VERGA PELICULON 20/10 Y GOD
No Name,4,"A great remake of the movie that was almost lost media. While sometimes slow, and the nudity was a bit much, it very much so fits with the theme of control and possession. Go into this movie expecting a Robert Eggers Experiment, not a Dracula movie."
No Name,2,"Stylish cinematography, but often wooden acting and the plot lines were a bit all over the place."
No Name,1.5,"Choppiest movie I‚Äôve seen in a very long time. The cinematography was fantastic and the color usage was great but that can‚Äôt carry a movie. The plot was borderline bad, definitely bland. The movie didn‚Äôt make sense in a lot of parts and was edited badly. Not scary and didn‚Äôt really hold the audience gaze throughout. The only redeeming quality‚Äôs were the acting and the cinematography, other than that, it was buns."
Dani S,3,"Appreciate the nods to the original movie, but it seemed a less scary, less dramatic version of Bram Stoker's Dracula.  As someone who is typically easily scared, I felt this movie was lackluster."
No Name,3.5,The cinematography was incredible. Felt like it drags a bit.
James,5,"Good nod at the original, great cinematography, powerful performances."
Corinne,5,Incredible. Robert Eggers never misses.
Jacquie,2,The movie is so dark(lighting). I was not able to see the actors faces for most of the movie so I can't really tell you if it was well acted. William DeFoe(one of my faves) over did it with his character.  Gave the film 2 stars for Lilly Depps performance. Overall very disappointing
No Name,5,"I thought this film was outstanding, the acting, the cinematography, the chill to the bone it gave me at times. There were so many underlying bits I know I missed so I can‚Äôt wait to watch it again. It is a must for the cinema to appreciate it fully. It‚Äôs very story heavy so if you‚Äôre expecting Twilight or an action packed vampire film this may not be for you"
Aglitterwizard,5,"Feels like it drags a little at times, but the cinematography and the overall narrative make it 100% worth the watch! Horror has a tendency to make me very angry based on the way that the characters are written and their actions. This movie evades that commonality and even forgoes common jump scares and low-hanging horror shots in favor of actually unsettling shots and an overwhelming sense of dread that feels real instead of manufactured."
Douglas V,3,needed more subtitles for dialog that was hard to understand
John H,0.5,"Terrible movie, too dark, plot was already used in many other movies. Just a waste of time I thought. Not sure if it was low budget, but it looked like it. I was disappointed after the trailer."
Stephany M,5,"Beautiful on big screen and amazing acting.
Felt like old cinema with modern twist. Loved it!"
Raf,5,"As a fan of horror and more particularly Werner Herzogs Nosferatu, I really enjoyed this movie. It goes for something different than other vampire movies while sticking to the mythology fairly well. This really feels like a Robert Eggers movie about Dracula than it feels like a Dracula movie made by Robert Eggers (if you follow me)."
No Name,1,Pretty average movie.  Style over substance for me.  Over acted.  Over the top. Not my cup of tea. Or blood üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
No Name,2,"Although visually stunning, I was just not entertained. The score was irritating. It was way too loud in certain parts and the loud breathing was stupid. I guess it was supposed to be a very ""artsy"" movie that paid homage to the original. Fine. Just didn't enjoy it."
No Name,4.5,"Really enjoyed it. Very stylized, more atmospheric than scary.. But enjoyable, nonetheless."
No Name,5,Finally after 103 years the very first horror icon ever existed returns Definitely worth watching before we have Freddy Krueger Jason Voorhees Michael Myers and much other horror icons there's one Icon who existed before them and that icon is none other than..... NOSFERATU.
Kelly E.,1,We were very disappointed. Very bored and fighting to stay awake.
No Name,4.5,"If you are in the mood for a horror film, this is the one! This movie comes with plenty of gruesome scenes, some nudity, and a heavy gothic undertone which is not for the faint hearted. The cinematography, animation, and acting are done fantastically."
No Name,4,"While it's not going to be for everyone with its graphic, sometimes unsettling scenes, it brings legitimate art back into horror cinema."
Mary M,1,Dracula movies should be and always have been sensual. This movie had no sensuality whatsoever. The acting was subpar all around. The close-ups almost made it into a comedy.
Jenie,2.5,"It was not as cinematically beautiful as I expected, nor did Egger do anything surprising or innovative with filming this much-told story."
mike,1,it's just a üëé Dracula. Not worth your time.
Tajonnie,5,"Lily is a profound actress. This movie was really beautiful.  Dark, but with alluring Art and cinematography aspects"
No Name,0.5,"style over substance. Misscast, overacted and a poor script are just the beginnings of its failings. If I wasn't relying on a lift home I would not have stayed to the woefully underwritten ending. This has been done way better many times. What was the point of this overlong farce."
Summer,2,Wanted it to be more action. It wasn‚Äôt walk out and but I won‚Äôt watch it again
No Name,5,"Absolutely amazing, can't wait to watch it again and check the director's cut"
Tom K.,5,Brilliant cinematography and overall riveting
No Name,2.5,"Moved slow, not a good job of explaining the background story, not scary. More of a psychological look at the characters and story overall. Relatively entertaining but did not get invested at all"
Sharron,1.5,The first half was great. But once you get to the second part its just sloppy and awful. There wasnt any real terror it was more just about gore and only gore lots of blood but no real story. I expected more!
dennis,2,Hard to follow and understand. No plot
Erica,3,It was just ok. It did not engage our attention - it felt like a play - watching people play characters instead of feeling engaged and believing the actor is the character.
Carrie,3,The movie plot was slow. Husband found it hard to follow at times.
Frederick Medina,5,Very scary and very gross
No Name,4,nosferatu is what happens when your toxic ex (who is a decrepit vampire demon) finds out you‚Äôre married
Dave,4,Good effort. Interesting visuals. Plot obviously very familiar if you'd seen other movies based on Dracula/Nosferatu.
MIKE,4.5,The greatest depiction of Dracula in my lifetime. A fantastic romantic tale with plenty of blood!
No Name,5,"Beautifully shot, beautifully acted, engrossing...Eggars created a world in which Dracula comes alive. The costumes, the sets, sheer perfection. Can't wait to see it again."
Anthony,0.5,This is a movie about a girl who fantasizes and then has telepathic bedroom fun with the bad boy vampire.  Then the vampire gets obsessed with her and tries to delete her husband.  The best way she can think of to delete the vampire is to literally have extremely long bedroom fun with him until they both expire. I think her husband would have preferred to try a wooden stake instead.
No Name,1,"I had very high hopes about this one. I love horror films, and was expecting a good delivery with classic touches, good acting and great story. The movie was quite linear, with no true horror elements other than some shouting. The drama was excessive. I left very disappointed."
Allison,3,It was okay.  A different vampire movie.  Kinda needed a little more background on Nosferatu IF you didn‚Äôt know the lore to start with.  It is a very slow slow story line.  Be prepared.
Nosferatu Review,4,"Overall the cinema quality and craftsmanship shine in every way in this movie, but I was left unfulfilled for a horror genre movie. The story here, although well told, provides much more drama than scares for a horror fan such as myself. I feel it requires the watcher to reach out find and then feel the connection between the Orlok and his choice lady, rather than establishing the connection within the movie. Therefore, I struggled to stay engaged and interested with this one, but the acting and imagery was very well done."
David,4.5,"Stunningly good movie. The visuals, acting, and vibes were spot on. Script didn't answer every question about the plot, otherwise would have been 5 stars. Definitely recommend."
Gavin A,5,"I loved the ending, very thought provoking, can't say more without giving it away. Also ties in well with ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"""
Daniel B,0.5,Terrible remake. Don't wast your time.
No Name,4,"Excellent adaptation of Dracula. Loved the death/plague/horror embodiment of Orloks character. Not the nonsense comedy that the vampire genre has been relegated to. One point of contention for me is there should have been more about why Orlok was so damn obsessed with Ellen. Orlok could have also been more menacing, aesthetically. Ill have to rewatch to catch all the details."
Jim,2.5,Brilliantly shot and great acting...but TOO LONG and the story line was choppy and confusing at times.
Margaux,4.5,Beautiful cinema and story tellung
Rob,3.5,Loved the visual style!
Abel,4,The film had a good Gothic horror element to it. It was eerie and the soundtrack accompanying the eerie really helped immerse me.
Daniel,4.5,Very well paced movie that engages the senses. An ode to a classic movie with surprises at every corner
No Name,0.5,"Tries very hard to project itself as a serious piece of art, but falls apart in poor writing and dialogue that constantly break your suspended disbelief. More than once the entire audience laughed at what should have been a serious moment. I'm surprised I was the only one to walk out when I did."
Cam,1,"Not very explanatory, gives a little more info after the first hour but even then - not a great movie overall. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to a friend."
B Zarate,5,"The photography is amazing. The gothic ambient very characteristic from Vampires was enhanced, I love it"
Robert G,5,"very dark. Not too scary. defiantly the ugliest Dracula ever but not the Scariest. In my opinion, Christopher Lee is the best!"
Kaylyn B,5,A movie that definitely stands out from a lot of other movies that came out this year
Alex,4,"better than I thought it would be. definitely a eggers film with weird scenes and every person bitten by the vampire moans like they're orgasming. not scary, but definitely disturbing and unsettling. very great Oscar worthy acting from the whole cast, beautiful sets, makeup, pacing. definitely not a movie for the dumb tik tok zero attention span people."
William B,1,"Very slow and too theatrical for my taste. Not what I was looking for in a horror movie. I've never seen the original, so maybe I should have started there."
No Name,5,Superbe direction photo et bonne ambiance gothique. J'ai personnellement trouv√© le film effrayant malgr√© le rythme lent.
Austen,2.5,"Very weird and sometimes hard to follow. Lots of old school Latin or something similar spoken by the main bad guy.

I wouldnt pay to see it knowing what I know now. Watch it at home if you really want to."
No Name,4.5,A fantastic film for fans of the Dracula legend
Jeffrey,1,Waste of time & money. These positive reviews have to be fake
adan g,5,Writer did an excellent job. All the actors played their roles very well.
Dan,1,"The back story was well done albeit a bit dragged out. Very little time was spent on the story after Nosferatu arrived in the Wisborg. Its frustrating to see every film based on Stokers novel deviate so far from the absolute terror that is contained in its pages. 
The ending was absurdly abrupt like an old Universal monsters movie. I had a lot higher hopes"
No Name,0.5,"This is one of the very few movies I walked out of about an hour in. It was terrible. Confusing, boring and just not fun at all . Should be rated much much lower"
Dillan Q,3,"This movie is a gothic romance (using the description given by The New York Public Library when talking about the history of gothic romance began by Ann Radcliffe and Charlotte Bronte ""Her novels featured female protagonists battling through terrifying ordeals while struggling to be with their true loves""). Despite whatever body keeps saying, this romance and love is between Ellen and Thomas, not Ellen and Orlock. The story's main conflict (what I define mostly as man vs. self) is between Ellen (our main protagonist) and Orlock (the main antagonist) Orlock, on a surface interpretation, is Ellen's abuser, but on a symbolic interpretation (bc this is a gothic story) is a manifestation of Ellen's desires that have been demonized because she's a young woman living in 1830s Germany. Her traumatic past and intense self hatred are the main ""struggle"" coming between her and her true love, it just takes the form of Count Orlock. I could go into so much detail about this, but I don't want to put spoilers, just know this is not a monsterfucker romance - there is no romance between those two I don't care what anybody says."
B,3,"Elegantly done, mostly, with arresting visuals and interesting camera work, but marred by too many cheap jump scares and an overall tone of contemporary horror that doesnt mesh well. Enjoyed this version of Orlok, though, so props to Bill Skarsgrd."
Fernando G,2.5,"Photography is amazing. Scenes are immersive, dark, gloomy and desolate. The movie has many disturbing moments, as it is expected with a movie of this genre. Having said that, regretfully the writing wasn't there. The story was weak, despite of the strong cast. At the end, I was thinking 'good riddance'. Character development shallow at best, denying the opportunity to the viewer to sympathize or care about Nosferatu's obsession. Tons of missed potential yet again disguised in 'sock factor' of unnecessary nudity scenes which changed the movies rating with no added value."
No Name,5,A wonderful horror show that pays such high respect to the cinematic cultural heritage it pulls from. Robert Eggers has done yet another masterpiece
Jeff,1.5,The story moves too slow and is simply an adaptation of Dracula. No real scary moments.
John D,5,"Hugh quality actors, sets, effects and  story. Best horror film in decades."
Chris,3.5,"I walked out of the theater not knowing what to think. Its definitely a compelling movie and easily transports you into that darkened world of 1838 Germany. The cinematography is amazing. The actors are very convincing. And yet, its an unsettling movie. The Count Orlock character, to me, was less a (traditional) vampire and more an ancient, dark, malevolent force sucking the life out of its victims. Ill say this, it stays with you as you keep rolling it about in your mind."
No Name,2,Picture and costumes design of this movie are a masterpiece. Unfortunally the plot and characters do not do justice to all potential this movie had. I‚Äôll watch it again? Probably not.
Roxanne B,3,Not very engaging in terms of story.
Stavros,2,This movie had so much more potential‚Ä¶ beautiful cinematography but it turned out to be just another ‚Äútypical‚Äù scary movie. Not much of dialogue. Mostly supernatural horror scenes. If that‚Äôs your taste then you would love the movie. Not my cup of tea
Adriana,1,so very bad. it was beautiful cinematography but a waste of time.
Joseph,3,"Cinematography and acting were fabulous. Pacing was off and plot was push-button. Theologically wanky. I was expecting a lot more, based on the hype."
No Name,1,"Let me start off by saying, I love everything Dracula, gothic, and horror. I thought the movie had amazing cinematography. That being said, disliked this film very much. I thought the story was very poorly executed. And unfortunately, I thought much of it was overacting. Please don‚Äôt waste your time, I recommend the 1992 Dracula instead. Most of all, I recommend the book."
Vu,3,"The movie was okay. It was an interesting take on a vampire character. It seemed accurate to portray the era it was set in (I am no history buff, but it seemed right?). 

I feel like the movie needed subtitles the whole time. It was very hard understanding what everyone was saying."
No Name,4,"Um filme muito bom, mas me conectei mais intelectualmente com os personagens do que emocionalmente, estava mais interessada no decorrer da trama, atenta aos detalhes da √©poca em que ele retrata a hist√≥ria e na atmosfera, que nessa parte o filme estava perfeito."
David,2,The plot was terrible and hard to follow.
No Name,5,"One of the best vampire movie ever, surely the best Nosferatu !"
No Name,3.5,"Simple narrative. 'Pretty' [in its ugliness] but didn't impress me. Very bloodbornesque though, which stroke my fancy."
Google,2,"It was someones very loud stylistic nightmare brought to the silver screen. The jump scares by sound were as annoying, like noise ordinance violation annoying,  as they were predictable. The acting was its only redeeming quality."
No Name,2,Excellent sets and costumes but poorly lit. Sound quality abysmal. Acting hammy or just bad. Aaron Taylor Johnson in particular was diabolically poor. Writing was pretentious and the dialogue was embarrassing. Villain was boring. Plot was non existent. Extremely disappointed - makes Dracula 1992 look like a masterpiece in comparison. At least that film was entertaining. This was just dull.
MARY E,2,"It wasnt your traditional vampire movie, but it was interesting, with a good story line. However, it was hard to understand the dialog and I wish there subtitles to better understand some important details of the movie. The ending was disappointing, but thats for you to decide."
No Name,5,Excellent acting! Atmospheric.
Christi M,5,"Really enjoyed this film. Loved the dark quality to it, the mysterious Count and the fear of the characters is greatly played. Absolutely had a great time watching this"
No Name,3.5,"Visually stunning film with themes of obsession and abuse written into it. However, I felt that it was still missing something in terms of plot and its allegories were left at surface level."
No Name,3,The cinematography is good and there are some strong performances. Doesn‚Äôt shake up the vampire genre.
Stephen,2,"Beautifully photograph and shot, well acted, but needlessly long and, unfortunately, anything but frightening."
No Name,1,"Deeply disappointing rehash of a story we all know. 
Although visually very pleasing at points, I expected so much more from this groundbreaking director.
I‚Äôm almost angry at how‚Ä¶ boring I found the film. 
There was very little in the way of character development and I felt nothing for their plight. 
Honestly I was relieved when it was over."
No Name,4.5,"Incredibly authentic and atmospheric. More so than Coppola‚Äôs Dracula and overall I liked it a lot but felt a little let down by the ending and felt I needed something more. Would an eternal creature ignore the first crow of the cockerel? Knowing what may happen after existing thousands of years? 

All told it‚Äôs very good and the cast really made the film. Looking forward to the extended version"
No Name,0.5,"Long dialogue, weird sexual stuff with corpses"
No Name,1,Make sure you book the seat next to the aisle so you do not bother other people walking out. I did.
No Name,1,Very borning. The ending was very disappointing.
David,0.5,"This has to be the worst movie i have ever seen
It was a waste of time and money"
Julian,5,"great, from filming to the acting, had me intrigued from start to finish."
No Name,5,I was so mesmerised and i couldn't look away! it was beautiful and im not a movie person but i sat through the whole thing i love it
No Name,2,"Nothing new, same Dracula story"
No Name,3,I did quite enjoy this film but it definitely strayed into comedy at times. Willem Defoes pipe deserves a mention and the cast had all turned it up to 11. Enjoyable but a bit silly.
No Name,0.5,"Movie was weak AF! The movie has no plot it‚Äôs confusing , has no background . Walked out mid movie because it was that awful !! Pick better actors next time."
No Name,3,The movie is ok. It's not scary. Weird is how I would describe it.
No Name,4.5,"I think the film was wonderful and cheesy, lived in the atmosphere of the 18th century, photography and graphics I felt really cold and terrified. But if the length of the film had been shorter it would have been better by removing or shortening some unimportant clips."
Maria,2,I was very disappointed with the ending.
Daniel,2.5,hard to understand them at times. very strange confusing movie
Missy,1,Terrible vampire zombie sex fest . Horrible
No Name,0.5,"Nosferatu, directed by F.W. Murnau in 1922, is often heralded as a seminal work in the horror genre, but not everyone shares this opinion. Some viewers might find Nosferatu to be a terrible movie for several reasons, including its outdated special effects, slow pacing, and lack of sound.

Firstly, the special effects in Nosferatu can be seen as primitive by today's standards. The film relies heavily on practical effects and in-camera tricks, which might appear laughable or unconvincing to a modern audience accustomed to sophisticated CGI. For instance, the shadow play and stop-motion techniques, while innovative for their time, may come off as rudimentary and fail to evoke the intended sense of terror.

Secondly, the pacing of Nosferatu is considerably slow, especially when compared to contemporary horror films. The movie unfolds at a leisurely pace, with long, drawn-out scenes that can feel tedious and monotonous. This slow pacing can make it difficult for viewers to stay engaged, as the suspense and tension build very gradually, often leading to a sense of impatience rather than fear.

Lastly, the absence of sound is a significant drawback for some viewers. Nosferatu is a silent film, meaning it relies on exaggerated acting, title cards, and a musical score to convey its story and emotions. The lack of dialogue and sound effects can make it challenging for modern audiences to connect with the characters and fully immerse themselves in the narrative. This can result in a viewing experience that feels distant and unrelatable.

In conclusion, while Nosferatu is a pioneering work in the horror genre, its outdated special effects, slow pacing, and lack of sound can make it a difficult and unenjoyable watch for some viewers. These elements contribute to the perception that Nosferatu is a terrible movie, despite its historical significance and influence on the genre."
Bruce W,2.5,Audio is not the best
Jennifer,0.5,Very boring. Felt like it was never going to end. Walked out before the movie was even over
No Name,5,"Best movie of 2024. Cinematic masterpiece by Eggers, and an amazing ensemble. Bill Skarsg√•rd is the is Lon Chaney of our generation."
Sue,3.5,Very good scenery and costumes but very difficult to hear the dialogue and all scenes too dark to really see what was occurring.
Paul,1,Didn‚Äôt like as it should have been rated more then R.
No Name,0.5,Boring. Stayed just to finish my very large drink and popcorn. Nothing new
Felix H,4,It is a dark and beautifully shot film that grips you from the beginning til the end with its chilling perspective. The sound was on point with the IMAX cameras capturing all the action.
Will,3,"I am vampire guy, so I was geeked to see this  movie.
But after watching it, I left wanting more.  Dont know who did the editing but it left something to be desired.  I should have waited when it comes available for rental"
Facebook U,5,Absolute perfection from beginning to end.
No Name,5,What an absolutely beautiful and haunting movie. The acting was superb and the dark and gorgeous nods to the original silent movie were so well done. This is a must see!
KatyT,1.5,"Really quite boring.  A few jump scares and a little gore, but that‚Äôs about it.  The cinematography was pretty."
Jessica,0.5,Movie drags no action not scary at all boring
No Name,4.5,"Majestical, biblical."
Lisa H,3,This was a long and slow movie with nothing rememberable about it.  I am always up for a new vampire type movie but I would not recommend this one to anyone.
Joelle,2.5,"It was OK, but did not compare to Bran Strokers Dracula. I did like the special effects!"
Martin-John T,5,Nobody can make another vampire movie! Peak cinema!!
rbours,1,Its one of the worst movies Ive ever seen
Sarah,0.5,The original was way better. This was a terrible movie.
Ceeze,2.5,"Frustratingly dragging. All the shock factor was burned out in the first half, then the repetitiveness got annoying. Eggers dropped the ball in this one, such a huge opportunity wasted. Cast did great."
No Name,5,I was gripped and captivated every second of the movie. It was totally old school suspenseful and tense horror with an erotic twist. Cinematography was beautiful. Not for the fast and furious crowd.
Makayla,0.5,The movie was terrible and dragged out .
Jennifer,5,"This was such a delightfully captivating film from start to finish. Incredible acting, cinematography and vision by the filmmakers.  I love how they really leaned into the gothic absurdity with all the gory spectacles warranted a classic horror film while somehow staying grounded in humanity,"
Lisa T,4.5,I really liked the cinematography and the actors acted very well.
TK,4,"Good Story, definitely not as scary as we thought."
No Name,0.5,"Simply terrible. From bad story telling, boring scenes. Be ready for
Nonsensical material
Breathing noises
Stepping noises
Sexual noises
Just noises

Do you have a date but you really don't wanna go to the movies but she insists? Take her to Nosferatu, you both will be out in 30 mins"
Paige,2,Cinematography was great but story was slow and boring
Paul B,5,"The music, the acting, the set design. Great pacing, truly engrosses you into the environment of the film."
Harvey,4,"It interestingly depicts a 19th century vampire movie, from an at times obnoxiously modern lens."
Joseph R,2,"It is good visually, and thats about it. No suspense where it is direly needed. The story feels rushed for most of it. The main actress isnt very good. Willem Dafoe is good but his role is small enough that he couldnt save the movie. Count Orlok isnt scary. I was hoping for better."
ALAIN  M,1,"Boring, nothing scary about it."
No Name,0.5,"The acting except for Nicholas Holt was shockingly terrible, particularly Aaron Taylor Johnson.

The only good things I can mention was the visuals, sets, and costumes. The script was truly awful, it felt like an amateur or GCSE level of writing. No flavour or depth to it.

Nosferatu sounded like Darth Vader with terrible asthma and an eastern European accent. The design for his looks looked laughable honestly, especially with his moustache and no other hair.

The storyline felt nonexistent perhaps because it was very predictable.

In all it had such potential to be a brilliant adaptation but completely lacked. I was so excited but sadly it didn't deliver."
No Name,1,"This was painfully boring and a mishmash of tones. It is a pretty movie with lovely costumes, but for a story that is so well known there is nothing original in updating the location and names if they're essentially still the same characters. It felt like 80% of the movie was a soundtrack of heavy breathing and slow panning to a shadow. I was confused with the characterizations where in some scenes this character is a genius and in others they're a mad man. Individual scenes might be cohesive but as a whole it didn't say a friggin thing. At times I wondered if this was intended as a tribute to silent film as it felt like they were a step away from constantly having all their actors come down with a spell of vapors. As scenes stumbled forward you could almost hear the directors' instructions being shouted out to react to something not there."
jpfire19,0.5,What a waste of time. Movies plot was stupid! I have no idea why the critics rated it so high.
No Name,5,"Move over Linda Blair, there‚Äôs a new queen of the possessed! Wonderfully disturbing. Wow!"
Amanze,4,Best movie ive seen in a while. My kind of horror film. not for the the faint of heart. The entire cast was amazing throughout.  great writing and direction. Couldn't recommend this movie enough to fans of religious/ spiritual horror.
George,4,"Not my favourite of Eggers‚Äô work, but despite some pacing issues, I thoroughly enjoyed this version of Nosferatu. I‚Äôm interested to see if/when an extended cut is released, and what was left on the cutting room floor"
Ben M,5,Loved it - beautiful storytelling and visually incredible. Stellar acting.
Alexis,4.5,I enjoyed the modern take on classic Horror and its what it seemed to be a dark love story too.   I would see it again!   Thought it was great!
Michael,1,"A FEW WORDS..
""WEAK A F"","" BORING"" PREDICTABLE""
If you want to pay for Nap üò¥ THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!! Negative 1 Star!!-‚≠êÔ∏è
SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
Frank G,2.5,"Nosforme. The erie environment and pounding tense music throughout was a little overdone. And the story being that the vampire is home shopping in attempt to leave his town where the commoners have been on to him, and he Nosferatu himself has a disco mustache with numerous jewelry, that‚Äôs what did the movie in for me. I can mention a few other things, but I don‚Äôt want to spoil the movie for those that want to see it. An odd horror movie that wasn‚Äôt scary."
Eli,2,"I‚Äôm not sure how this has a high of a rating as it does‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very slow going and is about an hour too long. This felt like a less entertaining remake of Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula, at least the makeup and effects were good in that version. Normally with a movie like this, I‚Äôd just say wait for streaming, but honestly this is so slow and uneventful, I‚Äôd say to skip this one altogether."
Ness,5,If you are a fan of gothic horror you will enjoy the film
Joseph,5,Great gothic horror!! Unnerving and bleak. Very cold and stylized. Loved every sick minute.
Jose R,4,Plot and cast are great. Not your typical horror movie which makes it very unique IMO.
Em,5,"Nosferatu redone 100 years after the original 1922 silent film will truly frighten the modern day audience. It is not a hokey vampire romance story, instead it is a terrifying, realistic period piece that thrills and disgusts. Gory, anxiety-inducing, visually striking and artistic. It was slow moving in some scenes to build suspense or tension but I think it could have been shorter than the 2 plus hours.  Great acting and sickening sound effects make this a must see if you like scary movies."
Jay,3,tbh I was hoping for a jump out of my seat scary movie instead it was a pass the popcorn.  I guess I'll have to wait for another rated R film.
duilio r,5,visually very good üëç
Claude,4.5,A visual masterpiece with themes of unnatural romance done in a provocative manner. Some of the underlining themes were overdone but all in all it was a good reinterpretation of a classic.
No Name,5,"Loved every dark and dreary moment of this film. It stayed true enough to the original Dracula that for any real fan, this is a must see in the theater. The acting was superb and I hope it wins the awards it deserves."
m_mickles L,5,Such great dark movie. Very creepy eerie. This vampire was no joke and spared no one not men women or children omg. Little bit of gorriness but not too bad. Very enjoyable. Found myself holding my breath in a lot of scenes in anticipation of terror lurking in the shadows. Go see it!
Pedro N,4,"Some transitions were too slow, and some scenes the special effects where too obvious, I still give 4 stars because the adaptation is very good and the photography deserves credits"
No Name,0.5,This movie is 2 hours of awkward corpse sex
Angela D,3,"Loud, like painfully loud at times. Good acting. Beautiful cinematography. The movie varied widely between engrossingly disturbing and just kind of boring. Not a movie I think I'll ever watch again, even when it's free on streaming."
No Name,0.5,"It's a very poorly done movie. The characters are not developed to the point that you ever care about or get to know them to a degree of meaning very much. The vampire here is far too dark to have any meaningful dialog with any person of any kind - it goes far beyond suspending any reasonable disbelief and, in doing so, becomes silly."
Renee M,2,highly overrated. I love a good scare and this wasn't it....
No Name,4,"It's a divisive horror movie, but not due to its visual direction. I think the deceptively straightforward narrative offers some good worldbuilding to bite into (pun intended), but doesn't really inspire the audience to engage with its characters on an emotional level. Without this, I bet most people will have little to take away when the credits roll."
No Name,4,Um grande g√≥tico de terror. Me deu ainda mais vontade de assistir o original de 1922. A hist√≥ria √© bem parecida com a obra de Bram Stoker. As atua√ß√µes s√£o muito boas mas o destaque fica para a trilha e efeitos sonoros que s√£o desconcertantes. Tem alguns jump scares mas bem feitos. Achei que o filme apela muito para cenas contemplativas apesar de serem bem bonitas. Um grande g√≥tico de terror. Me deu ainda mais vontade de assistir o original de 1922.

albert B,4,Extremely dark and disturbing.  Very sexy too. Filmed very well.  Highly recommended!
No Name,0.5,I found the plot and pacing to be very slow and it didn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense‚Ä¶. the ending was the silliest I‚Äôve seen in a long time; save it for home if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.
No Name,2,Lacked tension and predictable with no feeling of empathy for any character. It was just ‚Ä¶ watchable.
Savannah,5,"a beautiful film paying tribute to the gothic story that came before it. Hauntingly gorgeous, leaves you with a pit in your stomach"
Juan Mendoza,5,I like this theater because the service is good and the sets are comfortables
No Name,1.5,Style over substance. Very overrated
Andres V,3,"Not bad, not great either."
ImSlayer,4,Now THIS is a Vampire film.  Reminds me of the first silent B/W Dracula movie.
Russell,0.5,Hands down the most boring movie I have ever had the unfortunate luck of sitting through. Fell asleep multiple times.
Jenn,5,"Loved this movie if you dont know the back ground it doesnt make as much sense, but super good"
No Name,2,"Bill Skarsgard steals the show once again with the display of his phenomenal range of acting, but not even the pairing of him and the remarkable profile of Willem Dafoe could save this movie. Even the amazing cinematic shots that were within this film ended up being overlooked due to the slow pacing, and insanely unnecessary length of this film which could have easily been cut down. This was ultimately just an uncomfortable hormone-filled porno of the undead that is not for the faint of heart."
Janeth Louis,3.5,Decent. Long. Didn‚Äôt hate it.
edy,5,"Well made film, with a different take on Nosferatu"
Michael M,3.5,Beautiful cinematography and period settings make it a beautiful watch - but it does move at a languid pace and tone is fairly one-note. Liked it - wanted to love it
Alex,0.5,This has to be one of the absolute WORST movies I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire life. Not joking. It‚Äôs a necrophiliac‚Äôs/cucks wet dream. Not to mention extremely long and boring. But mostly just absolutely repulsive and disgusting to watch
No Name,5,Just watch it. It is gorgeous. Cinematography & acting are top grade. Robert & Bill are such blessings for me in the current film era.
Logan T,4,too much exposition and dialogue but still a beautiful enough film to be with seeing
Ryan,4,"Definitely one of the better horror movies in recent memory. As the genre should, there is no shortage of unsettling scenes but it is overall a very well made film with great religious and cultural symbolism (synonymous to those who appreciate). Story and writing are extremely well done, acting could be a little better in some cases but therere several moments where the casts talent goes above and beyond for sure. There is nudity yes, but I especially appreciate how it is never glorified and always plays into the over all moral of its story."
No Name,4.5,"Me encanto, definitivamente va a mi catalogo de peliculas favoritas, no le doy las 5 estrellas porque admito qu√© en la transici√≥n de ""ya viene"" y ""ya llego pero aun no aparece"" se hizo un poco pesada la pel√≠cula, igual creo que habr√≠a ayudado tener un poco m√°s trasfondo de como fue la relaci√≥n de Ellen con Orlock antes, cuando ""era bueno"" con ella para entender un poco m√°s ese contexto ah√≠ e involucrarnos m√°s en el triangulo amoroso, sin embargo la met√°fora de la represi√≥n sexual femenina esta incre√≠ble. La tension sexual de Ellen con el conde es muy palpable al punto que es raro sentirte seducido por un personaje fisicamente tan horrible. Nicol√°s como Thomas es espectacular. No es una pel√≠cula para cualquiera, hay que ver m√°s all√° de lo obvio y hacer una interpretaci√≥n de lo que ves. Cinematograf√≠a hermosa. Definitivamente la ver√© de nuevo."
No Name,4,"Acho que esse vampiro quer chupar outra coisa üëÄ

finalmente assisti ao t√£o esperado ""Nosferatu"", que chegou ao Brasil no in√≠cio deste ano ap√≥s ter seu lan√ßamento adiado. E j√° adianto: valeu a pena esperar! O filme original de 1922 √© um marco do cinema de horror, trazendo uma adapta√ß√£o n√£o oficial do cl√°ssico Dr√°cula, de Bram Stoker. No entanto, √© o visual do filme inspirado pelo Expressionismo Alem√£o, que tornou o Conde Orlok um √≠cone do g√™nero ‚Äî t√£o conhecido quanto o pr√≥prio Dr√°cula, sua vers√£o original.

Agora, em 2025, temos uma releitura moderna sob a vis√£o de Robert Eggers, e honestamente, n√£o poderia haver escolha melhor para esse projeto. Desde seu primeiro longa, ""A Bruxa"", Eggers vem mostrando sua assinatura √∫nica, com narrativas que desafiam conven√ß√µes e mergulham em atmosferas sombrias e densas. (√â um dos meus diretores favoritos da atualidade)

Em Nosferatu, ele transforma o remake em algo que vai al√©m de uma simples atualiza√ß√£o: h√° uma nova perspectiva sobre o vampiro e suas verdadeiras inten√ß√µes ‚Äî algo que tanto o filme original quanto o romance de Stoker apenas sugerem em sua leitura. O roteiro ousa expandir esse universo, tornando a hist√≥ria ainda mais rica e envolvente.

O que mais me impressionou foi a est√©tica g√≥tica e a aten√ß√£o meticulosa aos detalhes de √©poca. O design de produ√ß√£o √© impec√°vel, criando um dos filmes mais belos que j√° vi. A ambienta√ß√£o √© t√£o imersiva e opressiva que, ao mesmo tempo em que fiquei maravilhado com a beleza das cenas, senti uma certa repulsa, como se o filme me fizesse tocar nos horroroes causados pelo vampiro.

No entanto, se h√° algo que me incomodou, foi o pr√≥prio Conde Orlok. Eu entendo a proposta de um vampiro com um visual mais realista e menos monstruoso, mas isso tirou um pouco da for√ßa ic√¥nica do personagem. O Orlok de 1922 √© inesquec√≠vel justamente por sua apar√™ncia aterrorizante e quase caricatural. Aqui, a decis√£o de torn√°-lo mais humano e incluir um bigode estilo chevron foi no m√≠nimo question√°vel ‚Äî vampiro de bigode? √â complicado!

Ainda assim, Nosferatu (2025) √© um dos melhores filmes de monstros que j√° vi. A atmosfera sombria, a dire√ß√£o precisa de Eggers e o cuidado com cada detalhe tornam essa vers√£o uma obra-prima do horror contempor√¢neo. Agora, minha expectativa √© para Frankenstein, de Guillermo del Toro ‚Äî esse, confesso, me deixa ainda mais empolgado!"
No Name,2.5,"It was not bad, not terrible. It's not really all that surprising or unique, either. It went along with how many other mainstream horror movies go. It was slow, the interesting parts were similar to every other horror movie with similar elements. I could've been happy just watching this at home. was not worth watching in the cinema."
Driouxbie,5,"Gorgeous, hypnotic, and flawlessly executed. 
Go see it on the big screen!"
No Name,0.5,Wayyy too slow! My fianc√©e fell asleep and I was close to falling asleep myself. Another thing to point out is the fact that Nosferatu looked more like Eggman then something to be feared. Really bummed I couldn't get into this one.
No Name,5,This was a must see for me.  A major fan of the Werner Herzog version of Nosferatu as well as the gothic horror genre in general.  This movie did not disappoint.  It was beautifully filmed and acted.
No Name,3,"Good, not great.  It's at least 30 minutes too long which kills any suspense it might otherwise have."
William,0.5,Honestly was just pretty disgusting and I‚Äôm a very avid horror fan. Not scary so much as disturbing excluding the gore. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it to my worst enemy
Dawn P,5,"Incredibly well acted, and every shot was perfect.  This is a movie that will be studied for a long time."
No Name,4,"Girls always go for the bad boys and pays for it in the end. 

Bad boy falls for the p trap and pays dearly.

All that aside, the cinematography was amazing."
Josee M,5,"Stellar acting very interesting cinematography, Eggers never disappoints!"
Oscar,3,3.5 stars. Nosferatu was too monotone. He looks like a mutant from The Hills Have Eyes more than a vampire. The creators lacked the vision to bring the prince of darkness out.
Xtina,0.5,"WORST MOVIE EVER!!! It pains me to give half a star. Don't waste your time or money! I left 2/3 of the way through, I just couldn't take it anymore. Complete garbage!!!! :-("
Sandra B,2,Not my kind of movie. I closed my eyes through more than half of it
Movie lover,2.5,The movie started off strong and lost some steam towards the end.
sarai c,4,I felt the ending left you hanging.
Ian S,2,Was ok. Good visuals. Not suspenseful or scary
A,2.5,Expected it to be a little better than what everyone has been saying. It is a little boring in the middle and didnt care for the ending.
wolfgang,2,not much of a storyline.
moviedoc,5,"Good acting, nice plot and remake"
Lukasz Paul,5,Fantastic movie. Really well done I loved it so much.
Darrel,3,"Its a decent movie with great acting, but for a horror movie, it wasnt very horrifying or suspenseful."
No Name,5,Amazing cinematography and the cast performances were extraordinary!
No Name,5,Great movie. Amazing acting and great atmosphere
Michael V,4.5,"It had beautiful shots, intense crazy scenes that you don't even realize you are engrossed in till the scene ends and you realize you've been wide eye for 5  minutes.  It even had some funny lines....and a lot of scary moments."
Maria R,5,"This movie was amazing. I loved it, it was so different"
Jeff P,4.5,Beautiful retelling of the classic Nosferatu/Dracula fable. Well acted and shot. Eggers once again channels traditional cinematography and storytelling for a modern audience.
No Name,1,So slow we both fought falling asleep. Really not even one good part to talk about. Total swing and miss.
Wendy,2,Painful to sit through the whole thing. Not scary!! Very dumb!!
Mark F,2,"My main gripe is the different look of Count Orlok. I won't spoil it, but he does not look anything like the previous Nosferatu films. That to me is false advertising. The editing was very disjointed, and the flow of the film was tediously slow, and the dialogue was pretentious or silly at times. The cinematography is good, and some scenes were shot and acted well, it's just missing something and felt hollow to me."
No Name,2.5,"Slow moving, uninteresting dialogue. I haven‚Äôt been this bored by a movie in quite some time."
Abram A,5,"Intense,! Chilling! Very Gothic!"
Laura P,4,"Beautiful acting, costumes, makeup, cinematography etc production was top notch production. Entertaining for sure, could use more character depth and development.
Must be seen on a big screen."
Jamie,4,The action was amazing! I loved this movie!
Stacey,3,"Entertaining! B grade special effects and cinematography. Decent acting. Could wait for home screening unless you want a big screen effect, which the film doesn't really warrent."
No Name,5,Outstanding performance by the actors and glorious directing. I am both amazed and chocked! No movie has ever done this to me before. Bravo!üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
No Name,5,"Amazing slow burn movie, excellent acting by everyone and Amazing cinematography and soundtrack"
No Name,5,"Absolutely loved it! 
Great cast and performances all round.

It‚Äôs something I‚Äôd defo watch again."
David,4.5,"The movie was gorgeous, acting was exceptional, but was a little slow going"
No Name,0.5,"The worst movie of all time. No suspense at all and the ‚Äúlove story‚Äù was weird, random and just bad. Several people left the theater during the movie. I should have left with them. Great cast, but the story was the worst of all time."
No Name,1.5,"An overstuffed, period accurate dud. Eggers is 1/4 in my book with THE WITCH being his only worthy piece."
No Name,4,"Not my very favorite vampire movie..I still liked the original Interview with a Vampire..
I will not restate all the positive hyperbole, but I will comment on the negative posts.
First, the movie is a remake of the original 1920s film, but you cannot compare it with a silent movie with no real FX.
It also is NOT a retelling of the Bram Stoker novel though its basic plot is..
To the people who hated it...its a friggen vampire movie based somewhat on the novel and the silent film. What did you expect?
The mood was great etc. Very stylistic. To the reviewer that said they hated the mustache,  don't you realize that it was a homage to the REAL Dracula, Vlad III !
My only complaint was that I expected the vampire FX to be better when he was exposed to sunlight.
Not just a desicated corpse, but maybe bursting/exploding into flames (Abigal) or disintegrating like Horror of Dracula. 
The killing of the kids added a no no aspect though I think Claudia in Interview killed a whole family too.
The voice of the vampire in Romanian (?) also was very creepy.
All in all a great stylistic, dark film."
Scott,5,"This is by far the best vampire movie ever made and Ive seen a lot. Its scary as hell, with zero jump scares and minimal blood the creeping dread atmosphere seeps and wheezes in its way to a finale that you cant unsee."
No Name,4,"Lovely cinematography, the movie was dark yet you could see every detail. 

Succeeded in creating a dreary, tense, gothic atmosphere and showing the obsession he had with Ellen. Story is based off the 1922 original so maybe not for everyone but I thought the adaptation was quite nice. There were a few jumpscares for me, and overall left me feeling pretty unsettled so I think for a horror it was pretty good. I'm pretty interested in the theme/idea of what the darkness and plague represent in terms of Ellen and why they manifest in her.

Nosferatu himself could have done without the mustache but that's a personal preference I suppose."
No Name,5,I was really looking forward to this movie and was thrilled that it took me away to world that didn't let me down until the final credits rolled . A must see in a theatre and I wish more movie could match this creativity and quality ..
"Big J Moviezzz,",4,"A stylish and interesting take on the original.  The acting is mostly well directed but, hokie at moments I think on purpose. worth the money."
larry,4.5,Beat Horror foick ever
No Name,3,"With so much material to draw from, I felt the film/movie fell short. I enjoyed the sfx but it could've had so much more.
The cast obviously put everything into it but if the script and direction is lacking their abilities won't shine.
It will be a hit mainly due to the advertising but I feel many (like me) will be left disappointed."
Frances,1,Horrible! This by far was the worst vampire film I have seen.
Tiffany,3,Movie was interesting. Very dark. I enjoyed it.
No Name,3.5,"It‚Äôs a beautifully shot, hauntingly scored, and exquisitely acted film, but Eggers makes some bold, risky choices that may either warrant unintentional laughter or repulsion from the gory and queasily disturbing imagery. Not to mention, it‚Äôs dry of fun or any real humor; takes a bit of time to set up things that may leave audiences bored and frustrated."
JaHoey,4,"-For fans of spittle, writhing and the cinematography of Ozark."
aj,5,Fantastic. If you like moody atmospheric slow build vampire stories this is your movie.
C and B,0.5,"So slow, both of us napped through parts of it"
Anthony,5,Gorgeous cinematography and brilliant acting. Extremely atmospheric.
No Name,1.5,"""Nosferatu"" is one of the worst movies I have suffered: inane dialogue, predictable unimaginative plot embellished with grotesque sex/horror stuff. It is Imbued with a maddening air of uber- importance, but is alas, just a trifling attempt to represent classic literature."
No Name,5,"If you love the horror genre and artistically shot movies, this is your ticket!  Beautifully gross and unsettling.  The acting is wonderful and the scenery is amazing."
No Name,5,"Must see for anyone into vampire movies, it's very good but I would have liked it to be a bit longer, it feels like they zoomed through the visit to Transylvania which could have been expanded on."
No Name,1,"Chato, cansativo e entediante. Nosferatu ate pode dar um ou outro susto, mas o filme √© muito arrastado"
Steven F,5,This is what a vampire film should be as Robert Eggers doesn't just have a great understanding of the source material and the adaptations that came before him.  He creates a film that plays more with the vampire folklore as well as its effects on the world as a woman copes with her own being and her connection with this creature.  A must-see for anyone that loves vampire films.
Brandon,3.5,Very different watch. Tons of metaphor if you look deeper than what you see on screen. Ending was what kept me from really liking it.
Karen  K,3.5,Artistically done. Excellent acting on all fronts. This is so far above most of the cheesy movies of this genre. Not so much scary as a great portrayal of the literary origin.
Anthony B,3,"Was kind of suspenseful, great acting, thirsty the ending was very strange and odd"
Bonnie D,5,"This movie was well acted. The cinematography was fantastic, the story was so close to both books .  I would highly recommend seeing this movie."
D,4,Great style. Horrific. Lengthy and slow. Good performances.
No Name,5,"What a great way to start the year!
I just got back from the movie theater and, WOW, Nosferatu blew me away.
The editing, the transitions, the INFINITE references, how he managed to tell so much in this little goth gem, a masterclass!
Will have to rewatch to catch everything because it was a lot, amazing!
I want to suck (dad joke) every reference and interpretation from this movie because I absolutely loved it."
No Name,2,"I didn't care for it. Slow, unknown actors, meh acting, confusing, doesn't match Bram S. Dracula or many others. I left the theatre with about 30 minutes left - my time was better spent on my phone in the lobby."
No Name,1,"The Films Story is actually bullshit. If I could give 0 stars, i would do that.

0 tension, absolutely boring.

Better pay ur bills, instead of paying to watch this."
No Name,1.5,"Some of the acting was good, the sets and costumes extremely good but overall it was a very weak portrayal, nothing interesting to see really. I have never being so bored at the movies in a while."
David,2.5,It was aight. Willem Defoe performance was my favorite part of the movie and also it is visually striking but thats all I can say.
annie,5,horrifying! well done. can't wait to see what happens next.
No Name,4,"Having rewatched the original superb 1922 Nosferatu and the so so Last voyage of the demeter I went alone to see this remake. Atmosphere was top notch with some natural scenarios from Romania and Tchechia and excelente gothic sets. On the minus side they put in a lot of Exorcist ripoffs to spice up the story and the vampire was way inferior than the original with an unnecessary mustache. This is a great example of how to do gothic horror the right way, a thing that many times has been lacking in the last decade."
Robrob,3,"cinematography, characters, and their portrail were top-notch and carried the film. Although the atmosphere provided by music/ambiance placement, and selection did little to enhance and in ways negated the horror that was attempted. Also, the stash... why?"
Robyn P,5,"visually stunning story is well told, acting is great neither too long not too short"
No Name,4.5,"An innovative version of the cinema classic, very beautifully filmed, with good performances, which presents a version of Count Orlok that is not satisfied with repeating what has been done in past presentations and that is undoubtedly worth seeing in a movie theater."
Lisa B,5,Fantastic! I was mesmerized for 2 hours!
Christopher G,4,"My partner said its too scary, I loved it. It was a bit too slow, but given the story and how it was written the pace was how it needed to be."
MacVillain,4.5,"Atmospheric, tense and darkly beautiful."
James,2.5,"not very scary and slow in parts. A movie to watch at home,,,"
No Name,1,"A wonderfully filmed movie, a great period piece. But Justin awful story, and very boring!"
Les C,1.5,Looks great but could understand a mumbling word through the whole thing.
Shinnie W,2.5,"Not interesting, neither scary. Beautifully shots"
No Name,2.5,"From all the reviews I had seen I anticipated a full on old school style atmospheric gothic romantic horror but it was Not what I expected.
It was good but  definitely love or hate film.

I did find the first 30 to 45 or so and the last half hour to be the most gothic with atmosphere and the most enjoyable parts. But the bit in between I feel they lost that magic and it could have been any other modern unimaginative horror movie.

Lots of obvious jump scares. Lots of sxual  scenes and a bit of a mixed storyline with holes in the plot.

It's a long film also and again i feel some bits weren't needed.

My biggest thing i can say is, I think if Tim burton had directed it and it was more of a sleepy hollow style atmosphere mixed with horror, the film would have been way better with a naturally spooky atmospheric twist.

Worth a watch at home when it comes on prime though, if modern gothic style horror is your thing.

I think the 1993 bram stoker's Dracula is much better and classic and of course you can't beat the original 1933 nosferatu"
Facebook U,0.5,Absolutely terrible. I wanted to like it so much but there‚Äôs no positive way to spin how not good it was. Just watch Francis For Coppola‚Äôs Dracula instead
No Name,0.5,It's the worst movie I've ever paid to see. The movie makes no sense at all about a vampire like figure living in a castle in the 1860's that alone should keep you away from this movie.
No Name,4,Yes we know the story but this doesn't take away from this film...perfectly balanced and a joy to watch
No Name,4.5,"My New favorite Eggers movie, my previous was The VVitch, this one is even better and it us scary as well, I've seen complaints of people saying it's not scary, Fake News Lol. It's Really Good and definitely watch it in the Theater."
Raymond,3,I thought it was a pretty good movie but I just didnt like the ending. I wanted her to live but I guess
No Name,5,Amazing 'old school' vampire movie. Really gothic and dark. Great costumes and makeup. Basically no computer graphics. Great photography. If you love the original movie of the 1922 you will love this as well.
No Name,5,"I loved it. It was so unique, I felt all the emotions and it was so intense. I will watch again soon."
Arthur S,3,I didn‚Äôt enjoy it nor my date
vincent,5,Awesome movie and well worth it.
Christie,5,"Cinematography at its finest, loved it!"
Leila,5,"Great movie. Not slow going at all. Good story, beautifully shot,  very artful. Lily Rose Depps performance was amazing. Willem Dafoe never let's down. Creepy, scary, yes, the vampire is ugly. It's a serious horror film."
Brooke B,3.5,I liked it. I was a little disappointed he wasn‚Äôt hot when she met him for the first time like in the Bram Stokers version.
No Name,2,"Visually brilliant, great cast, but otherwise boring. Script embarrassingly awful, in places. Uses every available horror movie cliche except, interestingly, bats!"
jared,0.5,Great imagery fart of a movie.
No Name,4.5,"Great choice of actors, you can feel the power of the vampire, Nosferatu"
Sam S.,5,Cinematically beautiful and full oscar worthy performances!
No Name,2,"I'm sorry, i wanted to like this movie but it was incredibly forgettable. It just didn't entertain on any level. I'm glad some people liked it but for the life of my i can't figure out what the found interesting. I started dozing off with an hour to go."
No Name,5,Huge fan of the original and so I was excited to see this. It actually did hold up pretty well! The actors were great and it was really stylized in the direction. Def worth it.
Mary,1,"Expected a better story, with a better ending."
Jess,4,"I typically can‚Äôt stand horror movies, but after I watched the trailer for Nosferatu I was curious. I‚Äôm glad I decided to watch it! It was a great film overall. If you enjoy gothic horror, you will like this movie! There are only a few minor jump scares. Definitely recommend it!"
Jo,5,"Gripping, seductive, grotesque at times but all part of the intensity!"
No Name,5,"Es una obra maestra. Planos exquisitos, una paleta de colores fr√≠a qu√© le da un toque lugubre, ORLOK, excelentemente representado. Una verdadera obra de arte"
Olivia,4.5,Very well written. From the start of the movie the scene was set and it became even more remarkable as the movie went on. The cinematography was breath taking. Definitely worth watching especially if you like horror movies that look pretty.
No Name,1.5,"At times I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a spoof of a movie. Too long, acting was very so so. Great atmospherics but over all pretty boring."
Nora L,0.5,"Horrible! I‚Äôm not sure where all these great reviews came from? Couldn‚Äôt understand most of what they said, but its a remake, so u get the jist of it, but omg!    2 + hrs of waiting for something to happen. Save your $$!"
No Name,3.5,"They swapped the iconic scene where Nosferatu rises chillingly from his coffin for a jump scare. Overall, it was quite patchy. Half the time I was thinking ‚Äúthis is awful‚Äù, the other half was incredible. Hoult was very good, ATJ characteristically bad.

I really should take another half a star off for the moustache."
oscar M,5,A must see in Dolby cinema. It makes all the difference listening to the intense voice of the vampire and eerie score. Best Nosferatu!
No Name,1.5,"Underwhelming story with underwhelming characters, for an overall underwhelming experience.
Based on the characters that were introduced I was expecting a much more intricate ending, involving different expertise, leading to an intelligent outcome. But things just happened for the sake of happening rather than adding to the plot.  
The storyline didn‚Äôt have any explanation or depth, the more I think about it the more questions I have‚Ä¶"
Jerrold G,5,"Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the film
 great acting  great script fantastic visuals - really great experiance"
Kimberly G,2,"I thought the acting was fantastic but my dislike of the movie had to do with script writing: I always thought Dracula was seductive. In this movie, he was literally rotting away which made the scenes of intimacy disgusting to watch."
Danica,0.5,Worst post nut clarity ever
Ewan,4,Definitely the most evil vampire I have seen in a while.
No Name,5,"Absolutely loved it. Great pacing, gothic atmosphere, a real masterpiece of horror as it should be. No dumb tropes or jump scares"
davidjames,3,"It was ok, but definitely did not live up to the hype.  The film started out good and then began to drag with a disappointing ending."
Madeline,1,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. From Lily-Rose Depp's atrocious ""acting"" to the hilariously bad costume design for Nosferatu. It's lacked all of the elements that made the original movie so good."
Kenny,4.5,Nosferatu had great atmospheric scenes. The movie was visually stunning. Actors were amazing in their roles. My only downside was the pace was a bit slow at times.
Laura C,5,Fantastic movie and experience - more gothic tale than horror.
No Name,1.5,Es muy lenta. En momentos es aburrida con di√°logos que no aportan nada interesante. La parte de dise√±o de producci√≥n es muy bueno pero nada m√°s. Nosferatu sale como 5 veces en toda la pel√≠cula
No Name,0.5,"Underwhelming at best. Nothing new or thought-provoking, and a few glaring plot holes."
No Name,2,The movie was good until about halfway or two thirds in when they revealed that the main girl is an ex lover of Nosferatu and to kill him she has to have sex with him. I have no clue why they had to sexualize what would have been just a regular love story of a woman sacrificing herself so her husband and everyone else could live. Just like everything remade to original is way better.
No Name,4,"Essentially a straight retelling of previous iterations, with no new story elements, no attempt to surprise. It puts all it's focus on theatrical performances and magnificent scenes.

Great movie going experience."
No Name,4,One of the best modern horror movies I watched.
No Name,0.5,A really terrible film. The sets etc were very nice but the story and the acting scenes were terrible. I wanted to like it but I almost fell asleep. The vampire was just a big ugly mess that never changed and didn't display any powers or change of appearance. The best for me is still the Bram stoker version with Gary Oldman by a mile.
Lissa,4.5,"I like the cinematography and the acting however, the movie could've used more action."
Alexis,5,"10/10 cinematography and acting, 6/10 plot, but still worth seeing"
No Name,4,Tight. I joined my local tester and am getting steeped in film history. LovevwhatbEggers has done here.  A fitting cap to The lighthouse
No Name,1.5,"He is coming....and I waited the Masters' return
The heavy stylization, variable performances and absence of any resonance beyond itself as an iteration of Nosferatu renderers it an act of Camp
It is a film that screams it technique in every frame, but is actually undramatic, but hypnotizes by its cinematography its cold and absent heart"
No Name,3,"The casting in this was spot on, with Willem Dafoe being a highlight. The visuals and tone were good but overall I feel lacked some of the style of the original. Lacked a bit in terms of soundtrack and was probably about 30 minutes too long."
No Name,4.5,"My wife and I saw this the other day, We both hate the modern horror, gory, jump scares movies. This movie had some of that but it was all well within the story and not just there to get you to scream or jump. 
I have read where some people didn't like the way Nosferatu looked, but loved it, They made him just like Vlad which is the where the story all started.
 The settings in the movie was fantastic. From the Town and Harbor to the mountain scenery and the Castle. 
I guess I could see where this might not be some peoples cup of tea , but I found it suspenseful, scary and really something else to watch with so little CGI and"
No Name,1,"Absolutely shocking, was so boring I almost fell asleep. Don't get me wrong I like the idea but the exaction of the film making was pile of steaming cow dung. All the best bits in the trailer, waste of 2 hour of my life"
No Name,0.5,Terrible film don't waste your money. Not at any point is it even slightly scary absolutely pile of crap. I would give 0 stars if I could
No Name,4.5,Thought the acting and casting were great. Noticed how they really recreated the old film in many ways scene for scene in some parts. Hornier then we expected ! Not complaining ! lol
jeff dunat,1,"Dreadful.
One of the worst movies Ive ever seen.
Bad acting. Stupid. Boring.
I wanted to give it zero stars."
No Name,5,Absolutely jaw-dropping! This film exceeded all my expectations. Award-worthy performances and the most visually stunning cinematography imaginable. A true masterpiece. Best watched on a stormy night!
No Name,0.5,"So slow. This is not Horror, this is a drama movie. Big NO for me, waist of money."
Ron W,3,"it was beautifully shot, but the story was lacking. I didn't care about any of the characters."
Dillon,5,"very interesting movie filled with amazing characters, a great story that stands on its own, and a very healthy serving of Gothic dread. loved it!"
Zach,4.5,"I don't usually care much for horror, but this was phenomenal. A cinematic experience unique from what I've encountered from others in the genre."
Huy,5,Absolutely stunning. We held back our breath for pretty much the entire movie. Its definitely terrifying yet beautiful at the same time. Its a perfect remake of the original Nosferatu film in every way.
No Name,1.5,"It was a dark and immersive experience. But honestly the over the top sex scene and the ending just ruin the film for me. Totally unnecessary, could've had a much more developed ending without cheap sex tricks."
Michael,3,Had great potential and some real positives. Frankly I just thought the lighting was too dark artistically over form/practicality as well as hard to understand whispers and different voice accents etc.   could have been awesome but good.
Jan D G,5,"I really enjoyed the movie and also for a Nosferatu movie I think they keep it authentic, traditional, and original in its own way and I like that!"
Ryan,2.5,"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either."
Chris,1,"Not even close to the original Nosferatu or Bram Stoker's Dracula, this movie tried to capture the audience but my wife and I just kept looking at each other in disbelief, not a good time for date night... Acting was comical at times, but not in a good, funny way, just bad all around."
Tyler K,5,Anytime I thought to myself ‚Äúthis movie is so long‚Äù I‚Äôd get lost in the movie and forget about it being a long movie.
No Name,0.5,"I‚Äôm trying to understand the positive reviews for this movie. From the beginning the movie confuses shock value for scares and there are parts of the movie that are simply excruciatingly graphic. It never felt like a Dracula movie.

This is not a knock on the acting and I‚Äôm not saying it was poorly made, it just was not an enjoyable experience."
Trey,5,Beautifully Horrifying
Pk,5,Phenomenal! And Lily Roses‚Äòs goodies!
Lesley,5,"Nosferatu is an incredibly beautiful, terrifying, thrilling film. I‚Äôve seen it twice and would go see it again tomorrow. Captivating and devastating, can‚Äôt recommend enough."
No Name,4,"Set Design and acting 10/10, good movie and scary."
Daniel,5,How do I cleanse my soul ü´£ü´†
No Name,5,"I went in to this theater expecting to watch a kickass vampire movie, and ended up coming out of it witnessing what was basically a vampire porno. Incredible acting by everyone involved in this film. All you need to know is that everyone in this film was seething for Lilly‚Äôs poonanie and oh boy did she get it. Mad respect."
Beau,5,"creepy and suspenseful, not rushed."
JD,3,was an ok vampire movie just not as scary as most
Gary,5,"Great cinematography. I found it to be a love story. One you obviously don't want. All in all, a great movie. Nosferatu is definitely creepy."
No Name,3,It was a beautiful film but the story itself left me with no lasting impression.
Jeanette,5,"Different  from all the other Dracula movies, really good movie‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
ray b,4,Very Broadway. Acting was good but obvious. Movie didn't hold back on the jump scenes.
Rose H,5,The movie was visually appealing.
No Name,5,one of the most exciting movies ever made
Jason T,5,"Ominous, Gothic, Suspenseful, Great Cinematography, and performances."
No Name,5,Great film that will stand up years from now. My only criticism is I wish they had written more shots for the carriage scene to the castle. It's my favorite part in the original. A gothic masterpiece.
Darryl R,2.5,This isn't my cup of tea. Everyone acted their asses off. But it wasn't for me.
Kade,4,I enjoyed it. It got some bored and confused sometimes but overall i enjoyed it
Rupert,1.5,"Not scary, not suspenseful really, predictable, silly movie"
Isabel,1,0/10 freak movie. If youre a freak youll like this movie
No Name,1.5,"This movie is beautifully shot and well paced.  The acting is great. The audio mix, in Dolby, was outstanding. Sadly, the movie is still hot garbage.  Or cold garbage.  Whichever is the better of the two forms of garbage.  The characters consistently act in inconsistent and nonsensical ways."
No Name,0.5,"Don‚Äôt waste your time.
Really don‚Äôt understand the positive reviews. Boring‚Ä¶ story line all over the place‚Ä¶ wait for it to hit the streaming services so you don‚Äôt feel ripped off walking out."
No Name,1.5,"The acting? Phenomenal. The effects? Top notch. The story? Gratuitous and downright ridiculous. The movie spent so much time monologuing it forgot it was a horror movie and not some cuckold fetish film. It was bizarre in all the wrong ways, from the random sex to the unearned jumpscares. I was hoping the ending would be a redeeming quality, which is the only reason I even made it that far. Sadly it, too, fell short of expectations."
Andrew,4,"Slow at parts, but overall great move and is very worth watching."
michele,4,Soooo good but disturbing as fuc
No Name,1.5,"Like many of the corpses which lack blood, this was hollow inside. Very little effort towards plot or character development. Also, certainly not a horror movie. It does have a style but that only goes so far."
Alena M,1,"Slow, boring, weak plot"
Eric,4.5,"so great ! it was beautifully dreary and haunting , almost every scene was like a painting in a nightmare. all the performances were great, my only gripe was the look of Nosferatu , i get what they were going for but i had the 1921 version stuck in my head and comparing the two , the older one is better"
No Name,3.5,"For those looking for a horror film, I believe this one does its job, but it is a tiring film for those who want more action and less dialogue, I liked the new Count Orlok, but I missed his more vampire side in the film. Overall, it's a good film for today's times."
No Name,4.5,"When watching Nosferatu, I noticed that it was very consistent with both the horror and the story aspects. It truly gives an unsettling, spooky vibe and effectively brings an uneasy atmosphere to the viewer.

My favorite part of the film has to be when Thomas is entering the castle. Although there is no action at that moment, it conveys a dark, oppressive presence.

All in all the film shall not disappoint you vampire fans and shall really enjoy the experience 

Would definitely recommend 4.5/5"
Tommy A,1,Was really boring.  The acting was subpar.
No Name,3.5,It was something‚Ä¶ definitely worth the watch though.
WM,5,"Loved this movie! Robert Eggers, and the entire cast are brilliant! I‚Äôve never been more creeped out, disturbed and thrilled by a vampire movie than Eggers‚Äô Nosferatu!"
Kelly,3,"Slow moving, dark & gloomy. I laughed at the very slow shadows of Nosferatu's long, spiny fingers. I felt like I was watching a movie made in the 30's or 40's. I really wanted to like this movie, but it never really came together for me. The ending was not what I expected & didn't make sense. The acting was ok, just overall not as good as I expected."
J,5,Paced well and dark as it should be. A worthy remake
No Name,5,"A masterpiece of gothic horror devoid of Hollywood gimmicks and as pervasively sinister as the subject matter was always meant to be.  Those hoping for superficial jump-scares and shaky-cam CGI of pirouetting aerial vampire combat will likely be disappointed, but there will always be streaming Buffy and True Blood for that."
DeAnna,4,"Atmospheric, mysterious, and thrilling. This is a new version of two historical horror stories. The actors were outstanding in building the suspense until the end. Tight directing. Applause for the production crew as well."
Jackie,4.5,"Some beautiful shots. Clearly influenced by the Bram Stoker version with Keanu. Trippy, eerie, creepy, great acting. Some might find it weird or uncomfortable but that's kind of the point."
No Name,5,Para m√≠ es una excelente pel√≠cula. La disfrut√© mucho.
No Name,1,"Simply put, no amount of amazing actors could have saved this slow, boring, convoluted plot."
AECMayo,2,"Incredibly melodramatic. It plodded along. Characters were not at all compelling. It wasn‚Äôt scary. Set design, costumes, mood development, & musical score was solidly crafted. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. FFC Bram Stoker‚Äôs still REIGNS as one of THE BEST MOVIES EVER. Shadow of the Vampire was very good also."
Ahmad,3,why does nosferatu have a mustache?
Grace C,2,"If you are a long-time Dracula fan, this film is not for you. I fear the only thing I enjoyed about the experience was spending time with family. I was expecting a FILM. I wanted something more. Here are my problems specifically:
- The pacing, it was fast but also so slow. The pacing made it seem spoof-like.  
- The Sex, unnecessary at times and I understand the need to make it modern and audience-appropriate. I feel like it was a bit overdone at times. 
- The Beast, Bill is a great actor. However, his Orlock left much to be desired. 
- The Location, London is important in the book and original film timeline. This is more of a minor thing. 

I guess now that I am really think about it, I also enjoyed the nods to the original subject matter. Such as the wolves and rats. I would wait until it comes to streaming services."
Facebook U,5,"Incredible, artistic and just the right amount of fright!"
MB,1,"Awful. Boring. WAY over acted. Nice cinematography doesnt make up for a bad, bad movie."
Todd R,0.5,Worst movie Ive ever seen. 0 stars.
No Name,5,All cast preformances were top notch. The film is versatile while delivering modern day twist to the original. The voice work Bill put into the count is truly amazing. This was a refreshing new take on the role a vampire typically plays in films. This film is a beautifully written gothic horror story that holds your attention throughout.
No Name,1,"Movie was boring, story was boring, I was bored,  Nosferatu had a mustache and a combover wtf? Highly recommend you watch anything else.

I literally have a tattoo of Nosferatu and this was just disappointing."
Google,5,Awesome intro! Great costumes. Scarily good acting!
No Name,3,"Not every movie is a one star or a five star.

I don't understand either for this movie.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.

The visuals and actors are good, though Willem Dafoe doesn't have his typical great performance.  He plays a somewhat dull character with little development.

This movie is not at all scary, which was a bit of a surprise.

The story can be a bit hard to follow, and the vampire dialogue can be tough to decipher.

It was a passable two hours with some entertaining moments, a bit of depth, and good visual effects.

Unless you're an avid moviegoer, I would wait until you can rent it from home."
No Name,2.5,"Deliberately unclear frames and straight forward execution that is neither character driven nor story driven, prevents you from being involved in the movie until the climax. You feel just a little bit involved during the climax and then the movie ends. It is made with all the correct technicalities but the movie lacks a beating heart like it's monster."
Patricia a,1.5,"So bad,  I made my family go see this movie and now they wont let me pick another movie for two years."
Camille M,5,Visually terrifying. Sonically haunting. An unsettling piece of art.
Toddferatu,4,"Great atmosphere and suspense. Solid acting, albeit overly dramatic at points but still totally enjoyable. Plays up the hypnotic power of Nosferatu. Great cinematography, lighting, scenery, sets, soundtrack, and special FX."
Frank,5,10/10 movie I‚Äôll definitely watch it again
Dana,5,A horror masterpiece!
Tracy M,4,I liked it a lot. Loved the clothing. I felt it was very entertaining. Basically another version of Dracula.
Anjelica E,4,"Great acting, the stakes are high,  and jump scares honorable."
Zee,1,"Not scary,  slow and predictable.  Did not measure up to the original."
No Name,5,"Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. All of my favorite elements: horror, fantasy, love. A beautiful gothic horror film that really weaves a great tale."
Dustin Blankenship,4.5,"Nosferatu was a strong remake. Great character acting. Typical Eggers style, very slow paced. The most disturbing vampire extermination I think Ive seen put to film. Not a super scary film, but does the classic silent film justice. Id give it a 4.5/5 stars. 

For horror fans: theyll love it, a must own. 
For critics: theyll love it.
For general audiences: it will be divisive. Rent it to see if its your style.

Ironically, the friend I saw it with called it the worst film hes ever seen! And emphatically said he hated it and would never watch it again. 

So, inquiring minds will certainly differ on this one!"
No Name,3,"This movie was hyped up so much and I was super excited as a Dracula fan. If you're gunna make a remake it has to be better add something to the story, not do it with less passion. Don't get me wrong this movie was beautiful, at least the parts I could see since everything was so freaking dark. I wanted more creepy moments, more scares, more...super natural chaos? More feminine power? I was rooting for our leading lady and so sad when she couldn't embrace the darkness within her and still survive. Women in this movie either get to pray or die and that's about it, I just wanted more in 2025."
Disappointed,2,This was a painful experience haphazardly thrown together one movie which I can honestly say I would not add to my litany of horror films.
Elizabeth G,2,"To slow and plodding with building up tension. cinematography was excellent and I can't forget the mismatched pattern on Ellen dress, it was so bad it was distracting. that also should have just made a Dracula movie as they don't understand the original Nosferatu at all."
No Name,1,"Too slow. After an hour, I was already desperate for it to end or for something exciting to start. Some people left the theater, and I saw at least three people sleeping. The ending was disappointing. But, I loved the entire castle scene and the costumes."
No Name,5,"Movie Review: Nosferatu (2025)

I recently watched the new movie ""Nosferatu,"" and I must say, it was an extraordinary experience. The film brings a fresh perspective to the classic horror tale while keeping the essence of the original alive.

The acting was undoubtedly one of the highlights for me. Each actor delivered a captivating performance, truly embodying their characters and adding depth to the storyline. The music score beautifully complemented the eerie atmosphere, enhancing the tension and emotion throughout the film. These elements came together to create a mesmerizing cinematic experience.

The cinematography in ""Nosferatu"" was nothing short of breathtaking. The film utilized a striking combination of light and shadow to create a hauntingly beautiful visual narrative. The director skillfully employed close-ups and wide shots to build suspense and draw the audience deeper into the chilling world of Nosferatu. The use of desolate landscapes and intricately designed sets further added to the atmospheric quality of the film, making each scene visually compelling and emotionally impactful.

Even though there were so many positives, I did feel like the film could have explored the character relationships a bit more, particularly the dynamic between the protagonist and Nosferatu. It felt a bit lacking in depth, leaving me wanting to know more about their connection and backstory.

Overall, I would rate ""Nosferatu"" a solid 5 out of 5 stars for its thrilling atmosphere, incredible performances, and immersive musical score. With its outstanding cinematography, it's a must-watch for fans of horror and classic cinema alike.

I highly recommend checking it out when you get the chance!"
Ren V,4,good and freaky vampire movie
Anthony Cox,2,"sorry, but I was highly disappointed with this movie. with the Godzilla King Kong, the monster is looking very good.  I was looking for the same thing here with the Wolfman movie coming out this month.  how great it would be to start a new series of monster movies with these monsters, including Frankenstein.  all the action took too long to start, and I didn't like the way it ended.
2 stars for me."
No Name,5,This movie is amazing! I don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúboring‚Äù comments‚Ä¶ Robert Eggers pays homage to the classics but also adds his own unique style that doesn‚Äôt disappoint at all. Bill Skarsg√•rd is the best‚Ä¶ he brings so much life to Nosferatu & Simon McBurney steals the show! The best horror movie I‚Äôve seen in a long time‚Ä¶
Richard A,0.5,Very slow and choppy movie. Not at all worth paying for
Tyra,5,Kept us on our toes. It was scary but also hilarious
Donna R,0.5,"the story line was terrible, slow moving and dumb... the graphics and acting made me think of a horrible B movie from the late 70's.."
JACK,3,"Dark movie with no levity aside from scenes with Dafoe. Great to look at and great acting, but story could have used some work."
No Name,0.5,"Slow af. Nosferatu looks like Mr. Bobinski from Coraline. Lead female role clearly chosen for her ""Deppth"" as an actress. Bad English accents in a fictional Wisborg, Germany. Bad news."
No Name,2.5,What's up with that mustache? The movie is dark and moody yet doesn't seem to capture the 1922 silent version's mood.
Cameron B,4.5,Best movie of the century
Buddah,3.5,"Acting, suspense, horror"
James,1.5,Fell  asleep 6 times utterly disappointed in this movie! Wasted 126 on Christmas DY!
Ronald,2.5,"Too much monologue and not enough action. We all know the story of Dracula so the writers didn't need to drag you along through the same old storyline. When I g to see a vampire movie, I want to see the vampire do some killing and then get killed."
No Name,0.5,"Such a waste of any amazing cast. ‚ÄúSuccumb to the darkness‚Äù? More like succumb to the boredom. The acting was the one redeeming factor that kept me from walking out. This was the worst paced movie I‚Äôve ever watched and the most entertaining scene was s*x, boo."
Party Patty,0.5,It was absolutely disgusting. Several times I almost vomited in relation to the scenes with Nosferatu.
No Name,0.5,it as a very slow movie. I did not know what was going on half of the time and i only saw about an hour in.
Dale T,5,Cinematography is incredible.
Chris,5,Great film! Beautifully filmed!!! Reminds of you Bram Strokers Dracula!
Luis,5,"Did not disappoint, intrigued and curious about this movie , I left the theater satisfied!!!"
john m,2.5,"Excellent costumes, the storyline wasn't filled in real well, I feel that it doesn't match the hype surrounding the movie"
No Name,5,"Nosferatu is hauntingly, beautiful and yet, poetic. It pays homage to its source material while offering a fresh, terrifying take on the vampire legend. It's a must-watch for fans of horror and anyone who appreciates a well-crafted, atmospheric thriller."
No Name,5,One of the few great horror movies that have been produced recently. Keeps you on your toes the entire time
No Name,1.5,"Prince of darkness? How about Prince of simping? Hes like this skan fellow I knew, too much simping"
jakim,5,"Took a friend because I‚Äôm too much the scaredy cat and rarely do horror. THIS WAS SOOO GOOD, vampires are my favorite literary creatures so glad to see an iteration of a classic bloodsucker."
Jo,4.5,"Great story, good pacing. The atmosphere was very menacing throughout the entirety of the film."
No Name,3,"Personally I think it‚Äôs a good film, wouldn‚Äôt say great wouldn‚Äôt say Bad. But I suppose if you have a love for dark, gothic stories and architecture, then you might have a better experience than me and 100% worth the watch. But, then those who aren‚Äôt really interested in the style, or cinematography and just looking for a horror film, then don‚Äôt be expecting an absolute horror fest. There are a few minimal jump scares, which probably won‚Äôt even make you jump in your seat, I thought they were very predictable. I also thought the story was obviously predictable and it‚Äôs basically the exact same as any Dracula film, nearly identical to the plot of Bram Stokers Dracula. But, I would say the best things about the film was the acting, especially if you are a big William Defoe fan, he delivers as usual, and Bill Skarsgard, looked great and was very unrecognisable. But overall, the look and cinematography was great, but lacked a lot of key elements I think a gothic horror should have."
No Name,2.5,Definitely not my type of movie. Very Shakespearean in presence. The story was cool and a bit kinky to be honest. Way too long though. Stylistically cool too. Some suspenseful scenes fall flat. Alright movie overall.
No Name,4.5,"He has done it again. Eggers' take on this classic tale, and its forward-thinking expressionistic adaptation ""Nosferatu: A symphony of horror"" is incredible! Highly recommend, beautiful cinematography and the pacing is impeccable. Lots of nods to the source material, but still shaping its own voice."
No Name,0.5,Horrible movie.  Worst Dracula movie ever.  Should have stayed away when I saw Dafoe was attached. Confusing ending and zero chemistry.  The lead actress was however amazing and I'd see her again.
No Name,5,"Truly an amazing film on its own. Went to see it with friends who do not know the origins of the film or literature and even they were captivated from start to finish. The acting, musical notes, and visuals of the film were incredible and noteworthy. I recommend anyone who enjoys suspense and Gothicas to go see this movie! I URGE YOU! Those who enjoy horror films as well. It has effortlessly become one of my favorite films I've ever watched."
Sandra B,1,"long too dark and boring.  notferatu make-up looked terrible, the 1920s Nosferatu had it right and was so much scarier and better."
No Name,4.5,"A cold, bleak film. Beautiful in its visual design. Terrifying and enthralling all at once. By the second half, I was on-edge at the sight of Orlok. Nosferatu may become a Yuletide tradition for me, as it accompanies the darkness and sadness of the winter season so well. Highly recommend an IMAX viewing if you can find one. The film‚Äôs aspect ratio plays well on taller screens, not to mention getting a more immersive sound for the haunting score."
No Name,4,"Dark, endlessly creepy. Someone described it as the movie equivalent of a gothic painting. I think that is a very fitting way to describe it. I quite liked it - never truly horrifying, but always a feeling of darkness and dread. It's a great story wrapped around a true uneasiness."
Sandra,4,An artistic take on Dracula. Very well acted.  You could feel the fear and anticipation from the scenes. Not your handsome vampire  - what an interesting remake of the character. The scenery was amazing. Really enjoyed the movie.
maria,1,It was the wrong theater and wrong time. Never saw it and my Fandango birthday promo was wasted. I don‚Äôt  know how this happen when I purchase tickets in Bklyn all the time. Ticket was for Queens theater!!!! How?????
No Name,4,"Preciosa, la fotograf√≠a, cada escenario, los vestuarios, los planos y las sombras hacen que la pel√≠cula tenga un est√©tica incre√≠ble.¬†‚Ä®Am√© las actuaciones, las expresiones de todos los personajes y la historia en s√≠.‚Ä®
Tiene todo el estilo de Robert Eggers."
No Name,4.5,"Very few films make you feel. This film left be both bereft and awed. A masterful movie that, while I probably won‚Äôt own it, I am glad I saw in theaters."
Hughtomas,3,"Dark movie. It dragged a little bit for me, but overall I liked it. It‚Äôs worth checking out.üçø"
No Name,2.5,This vampire is sucking blood from where?
No Name,1.5,"I found this movie excessively long and boring.  I kept looking at my watch to see when it was ending.  It wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't scary and the scenery was so dark.  The sex scenes were disgusting and unnecessary!! The ending was positively revolting and frankly stupid.  I've seen most vampire movies and read the books -- this movie was worthless.  Save your money and time."
No Name,4.5,"To me, this is one of those horror movies you can't stop thinking about, long after the projector turns off. It's visually beautiful, has an amazing cast, and tells a heartwarming story."
No Name,2,"Slow film, should have completely reshoot into a Dracula film, as the Gothic scenes in the film was very good.
If they were to reshoot this film it would have been better than Bram's Stoker's Dracula

Film missing that edge"
Joshua W,5,"I don‚Äôt normally watch horror films, but this was exciting and keeps your eyes glued!!!"
No Name,1.5,"Went to go see this horror movie as a horror movie lover with 3 of my other friends, and I have to say this movie is very slow and gets boring sure it has some decent scenes but me and 2 other of my friends kept falling asleep while only 1 of my friend‚Äôs liked the movie. I have nothing to say about the actors but some scenes made no sense and we all left before it ended. And if this may offend anyone I will say this was me and my friend‚Äôs experience and our opinions."
Marisa,1,"I was bored through most of the movie but a couple scenes at the end were pretty good.  I did like some of the scenery, the costumes and  props of the time.  Not my type of movie but you might like it."
Katherine M,5,Well crafted gothic horror production.  Not my usual viewing choice but It kept  me interested.
No Name,2.5,Nicholas Hoult‚Äôs prominent cheekbones are the real star of the film.   THEYRE HUGE!!!   The costume director should get an oscar.   But relies on too many jump scares.   Too much filler with the lead actress having seizures.   The ending was gorgeously terrifying to watch but scary vampire is only on screen for  2 minutes in full monster mode.   If you like scary fx makeup effects and costume design it‚Äôs a 10.   As a movie it‚Äôs a 6.
Movie Lover,0.5,"Don‚Äôt waste your money ‚Ä¶fell asleep , definitely need a lot more action ."
No Name,5,A Reboot of The Classic Nosferatu 10 Out Of 10 This Movie Is Great
Fizzer,3,Cinematography was incredible movie plot was just ok !
No Name,5,"This man, Robert Eggers, seems to never miss. I loved every minute of this film. The cast acted the hell out of Eggers‚Äôs adaptation. Everything sounds so amazing, especially Bill Skarsg√•rd. Every frame of this movie can be hung in the Louvre. But mostly I was surprised by Lily-Rose. Her acting was top-notch!"
Drake,4,Excellent writing and instilled tension managed to carry through its painful over exaggeration
Ren,2,"Visually gorgeous, but it unintentionally comes across as campy."
No Name,1.5,"This is so bad I laughed until I cried at some of the scenes, worth a view for that alone, especially the leading lady when she shakes likes she's on drugs dancing to techno. The screenplay is slow, pompous, unnatural and stilted, a serious school play vibe

Well done on casting Alexander Usyk as dracula though, my wife complained that Dracula should be good looking and seductive, she was prepared to be mesmerised waiting to fall under his spell, but was very disappointed and ultimately bored"
Jlamas,5,I like how creaky and dark the story is
No Name,2,"My Husband and I went to see this film, I was hopeful that it would be good and he was indifferent either way as never really watch Dracula or nowt.

   So the film itself - the sets, costumes, effects and direction were on point but the film itself‚Ä¶sad to say but it was a wee bit shite to be honest. The majority of time in the film, was spent with people arguing back and forth about whether this WAS or WAS NOT happening and eventually Willem Dafoe turns up and it picks up a bit but still drags. 

   The best scene that myself and the other half agreed on, was that when he originally meets Nosferatu at his castle the genuine fear and acting was brilliant and very believable.

 Overall, It was hard to relate to any of the characters and to be honest you ended up finding the majority of them annoying as hell, to the point you kind of hoped someone would pick them up as a light snack along the way!

  Anyway, by the end is was a thank god for that kind of feeling. I am not one to be offended or disgusted by anything I have seen a LOT over the years and in my job - but I found this movie just needlessly unpleasant, pretty much necrophilia plus other nasty crap. It‚Äôs a shame but just goes to show the magic is lost these days.

   Worth a watch if curious but can‚Äôt rate it myself, my husband states worth a watch providing you have a fast forward button."
No Name,2,"I simply am staggered by the amazing reviews, it's seriously concerning that this new wave of critics can be so wrong to audiences however I can see the audiences seem to like it. It's not awful, far from it but I was close to laughing many times, I kept thinking of Wishmasters Voice mixed with Jim Carrey's Eggman. 
Some scenes went on forever while some were rushed. Honestly I think you are better of with Bram Stokers Gary Oldmans Dracula, but hey that may be just me."
Google,5,The horror I‚Äôve been waiting for
Richard,2,"So slow and obviously ment to be an art film
Way TOO slow.  Easily could have been 30-45 min shorter"
No Name,1,"in 100 years of cinema all this movie achieved was to be twice as long as it needed to be, half as scary, over lit soft shadows and five times more boring.

Side notes - Not sure why they didn‚Äôt just hire Peter Stormare to play Nosferatu as they must have spent most of the makeup budget replicating him.
-Did they even bother to film William defoe for this or did they just use leftover stock from The Lighthouse?"
No Name,5,It's a really good damn movie. That's all I can say.üñ§
No Name,2,"It's very visually beautiful, however it drags on forever and there's not really much horror at all .... Such a waste of potential"
Angel B R,5,"Impressive, Most Impressive üëè"
J,2,"A few good scenes and some nice cinematography at times, but the story is terribly written and almost non existent. Felt like watching random scenes in a play or something. First half was okay, second half feels way too long. Never seen Sonic, but all I could think was Nosferatu looked like Jim Carrey in Sonic trailers."
James,3,"Great visuals and good acting, but hard to follow and slow."
No Name,5,"Film splendido chi ha visto il film del 22 e letto il romanzo di Dracula sapr√† sicuramente accettare questo film. Per il resto la struttura narrativa √® splendida, il ritmo incalzante accompanato da un atmosfera magnifica. Nulla da dire"
karen,5,Loved the story. Lily Rose‚Äôs performance is perfection. The cinematography takes your breath away.
Johanna D,2.5,"I was all set to enjoy a gothic style horror movie with the religious element added (why do the movies with Satan scare me the most?). I am a fan of horror‚Äîall but the pointless slashers. Even the cheesy movies that follow the basic plot outline. So I feel qualified to offer an opinion. This movie was boring. The plot proceeded as expected and even when there were scenes that I braced for a jump scare, nothing. The characters are not well-developed and the scene in the castle were blurred together and ill-developed. I saw the movie a week ago and I am struggling to remember any plot points that impressed me. I was not drawn in by the religious trope. In addition, the sex or rapture scenes (not sure what they were supposed to be‚Äîwas satan having sex with her or was she feeling ecstasy from his presence? Literally, I am not sure. When the movie was over, I just wanted to hit the potty and get back to my apartment to cuddle with my dog. No lasting impression. No feeling of my life having been enriched or enjoyable by having spent that time."
No Name,4,'Nosferatu' is an extraordinary vampire tale that honoring its roots while delivering a modern horror masterpiece.
Zarkon,2.5,"Maybe this movie was overhyped for me so I was a bit let down. It was incredibly well shot and the cinematography was amazing. This is very much Gothic horror so its more about mood and atmosphere. For me the Nasfaratu creature was pretty underwhelming. I couldn't get past that weird mustache. It made him look like a shriveled up, old Borat. The performances were strong. This is worth watching if you enjoy brooding, atmospheric horror probably but just didn't do too much for me."
Daria,2.5,"Very beautifully shot, great cast. But pointless. The last ten minutes ruined it, especially. Hollywood seems to insist on defiling every redeeming character, and never letting good triumph over evil. The ending just left me feeling disappointed. The interjection of unnecessary sex is also jarring. It didn't add anything to the story and was gross given the context."
No Name,1,"No, just no. This movie will go down as the slowest, boring, and worst acting I've seen from a leading lady ever. Everyone was trying to carry this movie in all sorts of directions but it began as it ended, with no point or reason. Absolutely insane how bad and disappointed this movie was."
No Name,1,Filme chato e desnecess√°rio.
Tom,5,Intensity keeps building at a steady pace till it explodes. Characters almost always surrounded by darkness that they can't escape.
Roxanne B,3,"The Lighthouse was his penultimate film which deserves all the attention that Nosferatu is being given.  There were a few beautiful scenes, but again, this doesn't hold a New England candle to The Lighthouse."
Jacob,0.5,It felt like I was watching something inappropriate. I walked out of the theater feeling dirty.
No Name,4.5,"One thing that I liked in this film is that the scary/horror moments are not always shown directly. For example, the shadow of the Nosferatu's had over the city or the grim, almost invisible Orlok's silhouette when he meets Thomas. Eggers used the same approach in the Witch and the Lighthouse. It creates tension and makes the movie scary. In addition, the pace of the movie is slow for 2024. This adds up to the atmosphere of horror and uncertainty.
Another appealing moment was how Nosferatu died. No magic explosions or burning to ashes. Just a dried, rotten corpse. Nothing more. It shows, I think, Orlok's inner nature.
Acting was quite good as well. Daniel Defoe is simply a genius. His range is almost unlimited.
The scene with the carriage and the view on the castle (directly from Bram Stoker's Dracula) was so on spot. 
Overall, a solid work, which I definitely recommend to watch."
No Name,5,I loved this movie. It's looks beautful and it paid tribute to the darkness and lines from the original. Lily Rose kills it and she is stunning to look at. Bravo!!!
No Name,2,Why made a horror movie that isn't terrifying at all?! Watching this movie is like drinking vodka with sleeping pill!
No Name,4,"Beautiful cinematography, fine performances and art direction through the roof.  At the end it's a monster movie, but worth a theater seat for sure."
Dana the Druid,3.5,"Cool cinematography, great acting and scenery. The story is pretty much the same as any Dracula movie."
No Name,5,Absolute cinema. A phenomenal adaptation of the original novel and a faithful remake of the 1922 classic.
John C,5,A Spellbound dark gothic masterpiece. Maybe the perfect vampire film
Jeff W,3,"Sets, lighting and costumes were great. Too long and and too long. I was bored,"
Allisha T,4.5,"Loved all the actors and the cinematography, but there were A LOT of rodents. lol"
No Name,5,"I agree that there is a big percentage of flicks out there that need to, as some of you have suggested, simply stick to the standby bells, whistles, and convictions of movie making. To ""keep it moving,"" so to speak. I think those of you who gave it one chance ought to slow down (yes, slow down) and not expect or anticipate for it to be a film that jerks you around in that sort of way. The film stands in a league of it's own. From the very first stunning frame, it is a peace of art. Not in a pretentious way and I am not saying that it is beyond you ""getting it."" But, along with being great cinema it is its own thing. For the most part, most Dracula/Orlok movies, stylistic as they might be, just aren't that scary anymore and they beat around the bush with horror of the character to be discovered within the drama unfolding. From the first moment that we encounter him (and even before) we are swept in and feel the true horror and dangerous personality of the character. I am trying to remember when the last time was that I ever experienced that with that character (if ever), though I have been wanting a filmmaker to pick up on that for some time now. And the backstory and development of the Hellen/Mina character was not simply a unique or new twist for the sake of or obligation to try something new. It brought out the true essence that character that was the very soul of the film. She had always been a big part of the story but the way they handled it made her the main focus of the film for the first time. There had always been room in the lore of the original work to do something like this and it was high time that someone did it. Another critic claimed that it, once and for all, took away mysterious and romantic aspects of the vampire. Yes it did yet, somehow, it managed to be one of the most mysterious and romantic adaptations, going hand in hand with the horror and repulsiveness of the character. Again, this combination has always been what Dracula was supposed to be and this version finally touches on that perfectly."
Philip M,4,Beautiful cinematography. Novel twist on a classic story.
Yeudiel,3.5,"Freak Bob Movie, great cinematography, very intense but a comedy at times. Solid movie for you gothic horror freaks"
No Name,1.5,"As a fan of Robert Eggers‚Äô work, I‚Äôve always admired his attention to detail and atmospheric storytelling. I‚Äôve enjoyed every film he‚Äôs made, but I have to say Nosferatu feels like his weakest effort. While the cinematography, costume design, and tone are excellent, the film stumbles in its portrayal of Count Orlok and its thematic direction.

Eggers seems to have hijacked the original story, turning it into a commentary on gender and societal suppression. Themes like overt sexuality and gendered shame feel out of place in a film that was originally about fear, death, and existential dread. Count Orlok himself is a major disappointment. Bill Skarsg√•rd‚Äôs performance lacks the eerie, inhuman quality that defines the character. Someone like Doug Jones for the physical role and Daniel Br√ºhl for the voice would have been far better choices.

Despite strong visuals and some good acting, Nosferatu misses the mark where it matters most. Eggers reinterpreted a masterpiece but lost the essence of what made it timeless. This is a rare misstep from a director I otherwise greatly respect."
No Name,4.5,Brilliant acting coming from Bill skarsg√•rd he has definitely surpassed creepy from Penny-wise and taking it to the next level of Nosferatu. Some brilliant characters played by amazing actors. It hits the original gothic element with dark uncomfortable interactions meets gore. Definitely worth a watch
No Name,5,"The atmosphere was incredible, cinematography on point and the acting was impeccable. 

This film truly left an impact on me, not all films have the ability to do that so well but Nosferatu deserves to be celebrated."
Lucas,5,I love Eggers‚Äô work and highly anticipated this movie for a while so it‚Äôs no surprise I think it‚Äôs fantastic. Phenomenal movie.
No Name,4,Interesting twist on Bram Stoker's Dracula. Deliciously horrifying.
No Name,0.5,"The new Nosferatu is an absolute travesty that should be banned from all theaters immediately. This so-called ‚Äúfilm‚Äù is a complete waste of money, time, and talent, featuring some of the worst acting ever put to screen, a plot so tedious it could cure insomnia, and cinematography so dark and pretentious that it feels like a bad student film trying too hard to be ‚Äúartsy.‚Äù The lead actor‚Äôs performance is laughably awful, draining every scene of tension, while the supporting cast delivers lines with the enthusiasm of people who regret ever signing onto this disaster. The pacing is unbearable, the scares are nonexistent, and the entire production is an insult to horror fans everywhere. If there‚Äôs any justice, every copy of this movie should be destroyed, and the cast and crew should find new careers far away from filmmaking. Avoid this at all costs."
Avril,5,"Overall a fantastic cast, great sound design and visuals. 
If you're into vampire movies, find yourself a fan of Bram Stoker's Dracula or classic vampire literature you'll enjoy this movie."
No Name,4.5,"Beautifully made film and good homage to previous adaptations. Enjoyed the first half more than the second which I thought could have used some editing. Reviews calling it slow just don‚Äôt appreciate and understand the director‚Äôs style. His cinematography and camera work keeps getting better with each film. Thought the casting was also great, especially Bill Skarsg√•rd as count Orlok."
Enrique,1,I wasted 2 hours of my life! I could have been watching movies at home !!
No Name,2,"This movie will leave the audience split in half. You either love his work or it will be the slowest least scary ""horror"" movie you will ever watch."
No Name,4,"Perhaps Robert Eggers's most hauntingly beautiful film to date, Nosferatu captures the chilling spirit of its predecessors and original story."
David,5,kept to the original character and brought a 1922 film to 2025
Jeremy C,5,"Its a wonderful gothic tale and the most accurate physical depiction of Dracula ever put on screen. It is a slow burn, more a flavor than  a jump scare. Well made, brilliantly shot with fantastic performances."
Jesus e perez,0.5,That‚Äôs a vampire porn movie or don‚Äôt know that I saw üëéüèΩ
No Name,2,"Great setting and costume, but overall plot was not impressive. It is like a restaurant that focused on atmosphere, not the food."
No Name,5,"Makes you think that this is what people in the era were horrified of, incredibly well researched and the content beneath symbolizing melancholia and Nosferatu as death itself is horrific, complex and fascinating."
Leslie,0.5,HORRIBLE MOVIE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!!!
JOJO,1,Waste of 2+ hours of my life that I'll never get back. Long and boring ! The acting and cinematography was good though.
Dennis,0.5,I didn‚Äôt like this remake at all.  It was highly romanticized and very low effort for horror.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.
Elizabeth Ann S,5,Spectacular!!!!  Spectaculos !!!
Chef E,5,great movie. kept me on the edge of my seat.
Greg H,5,Absolutely fantastic. Beautifully haunting and exactly what we hoped it would be. Masterful performances and incredible cinematography. Bill Skarsgard creates another amazing character performance. You won‚Äôt regret seeing it!
Rafael M,4,"Amazingly creepy and offsetting added a very special note to the story! Also loved that the relationship between the count and ""Nina"" was better explained, made a hell of alot more sense why he was obsessed with her. Both movies, BSD and this one were great just don't compare them or one or both might disappoint you!"
No Name,4,"Masterfully atmospheric but ultimately a little dull. The first act is wonderful: spooky, mysterious, and full of disturbing imagery. It promises a deep and satisfying experience to come, an implication which is only partially realized. Once Thomas gets back to the city, the film meanders for the next hour. It still has plenty of great moments and starts to pick up again once the professor is introduced, but the ending feels unsatisfying, like this slow burn didn‚Äôt ever quite make it to a bonfire. As a whole, it feels like this film was trying too hard to stick to its source material, boxing it into an old-fashioned story when a more fresh approach could have taken it over the top."
No Name,5,"Nosferatu 2024 offers a fresh and faithful retelling of the classic Nosferatu story. The film‚Äôs atmosphere and cinematography are standout features, creating a truly immersive experience. The use of natural horror elements like darkness and shadows, combined with the gothic architecture of 14th-century castles and the historic Barrandov Studios in Prague, adds a hauntingly beautiful layer to the film. 

Director Robert Eggers‚Äô approach is particularly commendable. He chose to shoot the film in color, using natural lighting and an expressionistic style to enhance the mood and tension. Eggers‚Äô vision leans into romanticism, offering a new way to deliver the story‚Äôs atmosphere. His dedication to recreating the period‚Äôs authenticity through meticulous research on costumes and settings adds depth to the narrative. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a vampire portrayed as dark and terrifying, steering away from the overdone ‚Äòsexy‚Äô vampire trope. Bill‚Äôs performance is exceptional, and the supporting cast shines as well. My only criticism is that the film feels a bit drawn out at times. Overall, it‚Äôs a solid vampire flick that revives the darkness and vileness of the traditional vampire."
Zachary,5,"Nothing to dislike.. perfect amount of dread, the cinematography was amazing."
No Name,4.5,"It is ironic that what I think is the best adaptation of the Dracula novel does not have this name and is a remake of the unofficial copy of the greatest vampire. 

However, Nosferatu introduces us to the older bloodsucking monster in a totally grim, stressful, and disgusting tone. You can see the great respect that is paid to the legend of Dracula and the 1922 film of the same name. A great vampire film that totally respects the legends and gives context to their evolution.

A great cinematic start to 2025."
No Name,0.5,This was awful and stupid. I want the last two hours of my life back.
No Name,5,"Nosferatu delivered. The real horror came from many perfectly set scenes and accompanying groans, creaks and Nosferatu's deep gasping breaths. Being an avid Dracula fan, this movie didn't disappoint, it was a great retelling of a well known story. Bill Skarsgard never disappoints, he's made quite a name for himself in the Horror genre."
No Name,2,Underwhelmingly mid üëé
Ian,4,Not as good as the original or even the Kinski/ Herzog remake but a fine film in its own right. Full of creepiness and unsettling moments.
T,3.5,Great acting by the lead and interesting blend of the two stories. But it is slow moving with the ending revealed before the last 20-30 minutes.
No Name,5,"O filme apresenta uma narrativa coesa, que se constr√≥i nos pequenos acontecimentos, nos detalhes sutis, beirando o misticismo. O mist√©rio vai se desvelando e o oculto vai se intensificando conforme vai chegando o final. O filme √© constru√≠do em partes na qual formam uma hist√≥ria com come√ßo, meio e fim, bem amarrada. Acredito fielmente que a vers√£o com as cenas do diretor, mais longa, ter√° ainda mais a constru√ß√£o dos personagens. 

O filme √© assustador, a ambienta√ß√£o √© macabra e sombria. Os personagens cumprem bem suas fun√ß√µes, as emo√ß√µes de ang√∫stia, medo, confus√£o, raiva e terror est√£o a flor da pele, as atua√ß√µes s√£o bem boas. As sombras, a tem√°tica escura e o simbolismo presente nas cenas entram em contato com nossa linguagem inconsciente. A linguagem do ocultismo √© respeitada, os rituais e as inten√ß√µes refletem a realidade. A fic√ß√£o n√£o ultrapassa seus limites (claro tudo depende do qu√£o c√©tico voc√™ √©, mas bem que foi dito que a ci√™ncia mais nos cega do que ilumina...)

As cenas comunicam, todas est√£o nos dizendo algo. Isso vai al√©m mesmo da narrativa, como se aquela fosse vivenciado em maior ou menor grau com nossas sombras, nossos medos, o desconhecido. Isso √© t√£o n√≠tido que ap√≥s uma cena intensa, os personagens param e comentam sobre o que sabem. O quebra cabe√ßa √© constru√≠do ao mesmo tempo que o filme quebra nossa cabe√ßa com a transmiss√£o do horror nas cenas.

O ritmo do filme vivo, ali√°s, morto. Ainda melhor, macabro. A vida e a morte s√£o invertidas, s√£o colocadas como a mesma moeda na qual a inten√ß√£o dos personagens n√£o jogam a sorte, mas controlam ou se rendem ao destino. T√≠pico de um romance o amor sobressair diante dos afetos e desafetos e aqui n√£o √© diferente, mas a m√∫sica √© uma trilha advinda dos cemit√©rios, das catacumbas, dos ratos, dos cemit√©rios, do sangue e das ru√≠nas. Isso n√£o √© sobre trilha sonora, mas ritmo. Observa√ß√£o, o filme n√£o √© lento, voc√™ que est√° acostumado demais com filme excessivamente estimulantes... 

Nessa paix√£o sufocante contada em um livro velho em letras e s√≠mbolos estranhos, transmite muito bem para aqueles que abrirem para compreender a intensidade do sutil, da magia. O que foi muito bem expressa no filme anterior do diretor. A mensagem impacta intensamente a alma, reflete o que escondemos. √â dito no filme que precisamos aceitar o mal para depois enfrent√°-lo e acredito que √© sobre isso. Esse √© um filme de s√≠mbolos, essa √© a linguagem, se voc√™ ler, vai entender, vai obter o conhecimento.

Esse conhecimento n√£o √© racional, √© s√≠mbolico, √© est√©tico. A est√©tica do filme afeta de uma maneira peculiar. N√£o podemos fugir das monstruosidades, daquilo que est√° √† na escurid√£o do Humano. N√£o √© sobre tomar um susto, √© sobre ficar mergulhado no horror e conhecer essa besta de perto. O filme nos faz conhecer plenamente Nosferatu e como sua vontade e inten√ß√µes afetam a realidade. Nosferatu simboliza tudo aquilo que n√£o conseguimos integrar e iluminar, nossas sombras profundas. O filme conversa diretamente com isso em n√≥s. Mas n√£o √© de toda desesperan√ßa, pois tamb√©m retrata a maior beleza do Amor, que todo veneno por mais poderoso que seja, se dissolve na pureza do Amor.

Por fim, todas as cenas que tem gatos, as sombras est√£o iluminadas."
Barbara,2.5,There was no connection with the characters. Scenery was great and the story is an awesome one but the dialogue and connection just wasnt there.
Jessica,5,Great movie! Jump scares were perfect and the suspense made the 2 hours fly by. Highly recommend.
No Name,0.5,"I don't know who they paid to write these reviews but they're lying to you. Keep in mind I fully went looking forward to and ready for blood, murder, and vampire shenanigans. This trash could only have been valued by the most pathetic of losers 300 years ago. 
The way men wrote women in this atrocity has single handedly set back any progress. The only benefit of this is for the Christian church which might have more people taking vows of chastity due to the stupid and childish fixation on bad sex"
Conall RT,5,Bill Skarsgrd as Pennywise walked so Bill Skarsgrd as Count Orlok could run.
No Name,4,"Great Visuals, Awesome acting . Good watch"
Angela,3,"Nice homage to the other adaptations of this story. Well acted. However, its really hard to see‚ÄîLike actually too dark to make out whats on the screen a lot of the time. Also very long shots of quivering people, and long pans. I get its a throwback, but Thats a LOT of sustained fear quivering for a modern audience."
No Name,2.5,"For a horror movie it was not as bad, keeps you watching. Meaning of the movie is not bad as well the director did not a bad job. 
But again it was not scary rather parts where very funny."
No Name,3,"Nosferatu was the most unique film I saw in 2024. The theme and visuals were dark, gory, and chilling. The acting and cinematography were out of this world, but the story was weak. The pacing was also painfully slow. Critics will likely praise it, but it probably won‚Äôt appeal to mainstream moviegoers."
No Name,1,What a waste of a gift card. It was almost laughable at times. I should have done my research on the difference between Dracula and Nosferatu. ICKK
No Name,0.5,I will probably never watch this piece of trash ever again. My little nephew and niece have watched more terrifying things and they are 5 and 8. I had to try and keep myself awake the whole time and I ended up passing out at the end.
Ty,1.5,"Was boring, was expecting a lot of horror and there was almost none"
AverageMovieGoer,2,Though they captured the tales era it feels like a long drawn out afair with little reveals that excite one. Not even Dafoe's great acting could save me from nearly being bored to tears with how little they captured the nosferatu and how much they insisted to focus on everyone else. So unless you are a fan of 1800's renditions I would skip or wait for streaming on this.
No Name,1,This movie was so boring. I could tell that the movie was trying so hard to be scary and engaging. But I found myself for the first time ever falling asleep during a movie.
Tyler,1,"disturbing, gross, demonic"
Bobby,5,"Beguiling as it is stunning, distressing as it is enchanting. Nosferatu is on another level unlike anything we‚Äôve seen in years. It‚Äôs acting it‚Äôs impeccable. It‚Äôs design is unmatched."
Luis,5,The movie is well put together. I enjoyed it.
ROBNINER,4,It's a lot better than I thought. Great story
Ron C,5,This movie will scare you throughout most of it. The acting is amazing and Count Orlok is extremely scary and the perfect antagonist. the setting perfectly mixes with the story. you'll love it if you appreciate well acted horror movies.
Herson,5,The best movie of the year
No Name,0.5,"That movie was absolutely abysmal, atrocious, dreadful, appalling, an insult to cinema itself, there isn't enough words in the dictionary to describe how bad was the experience to watch.
The worst movie in the history of mankind, no doubt, and I considering even the future, because there's no way that someone could make something worse than this."
carron,0.5,did not enjoy...at all
No Name,1.5,"Actually really disappointing. 
Was looking forward to this movie. It‚Äôs very slow and pretty boring, nothing that hasn‚Äôt been done before, brought nothing new or special to the lore or genre. Enjoyed the original more for what it was. ü§∑"
Laurie,5,"Great acting , great set and original storyline"
Rudy,5,I thought it was an excellent story. Kept me on my toes the entire time. Movies are not made like this anymore.
No Name,3.5,Overhyped. Worth a watch. But overhyped.
No Name,0.5,"This movie was so horrible, could not understand what was going on don‚Äôt waste money seeing this."
Phillip P,4,"I thought it was bEAUTIFULLY shot, and what they did with natural lighting made me overlook the general slowness to the story!!"
No Name,4.5,Robert Eggers delivers another brilliant film.
Katherine,5,Beautifully haunting!
No Name,4.5,"So incredibly well acted and paced but that's not the best part at all... If you're anywhere near considering yourself a cinephile, watch this film!!! It's beautiful! Every shot is magnificently lit! So detailed... it's a beauty."
Greg,0.5,"Poorest retelling of the vampire legend I‚Äôve  ever seen, even the comedy ones.. Story could have, should have, been great but mumble, fumble, bunble and what a flop. I want my time back."
No Name,4.5,"O diretor sabe como criar um clima de suspense e terror sem mostrar muitas cenas repletas de efeitos especiais. O mist√©rio envolta do conde Orlok contribui pro clima do filme, ele raramente aparece por completo e fica sempre nas sombras, o que contribui para a atomosfera da tem√°tica de vampiro. Os atores s√£o bons, mas o √∫nico ponto que n√£o me atrai s√£o as falas com muita teatralidade, h√° quem goste, mas n√£o gosto muito de ver isso em filmes, falas que s√£o sempre uma ""frase de efeito"" ou algo reflexivo e po√©tico, as vezes um di√°logo simples funciona. Mas no todo o filme √© muito bom e vale a pena assistir, uma √≥tima releitura de terror g√≥tico do primeiro filme de 1922."
Elizabeth,5,"Loved the casting choices, lighting, and the music. also really liked the camera work. There were some really simple choices made with panning and also allowing characters to walk back into frame that I feel really added to the whole vibe of the film. Lots of nods to and style choices pulled from the silent film era."
No Name,5,Eggers take on this familiar tale is fantastically well woven and deliciously steeped in character. It opts to slowly build its tension and not take the cheap way out with smoke and mirrors. Some will call it boring but I personally never found it lacking in that way. One of my personal favorites of the year.
Andrew,5,I loved this movie so much! It had the elements of a classic drama/horror vampire story. You almost get attached to the characters and then see them suffer. Such a great movie!
Jeremy R,5,"Gorgeously crafted and with superb acting and suspense, Nosferatu is both a loving homage and a bold reinterpretation  of the classic. A true work of art."
No Name,5,"Very, very cool! It's a slow burn, but equally funny and scary moments, and the cinematography is so unique and different."
No Name,5,"There is no question in my mind this is the best movie of the year.  My family and I see lots of movie and like movies in general, and this one really was awesome(my kids did not see this film).  It was just dripping with mood, and had a look which many movies do not have, had super fun acting, and was really creepy.  
     I have seen the original silent film as well, and it's fun to watch the film makers update this film and take it further.  Really a great movie, but not appropriate for children, or a family movie, this one is creepy horror, not really gory, mostly high suspense, tons of mood, and honestly kind of erotic in a gothic kind of way.  Really cool movie to see, and refreshing to see a movie made with no modern kind of sensibilities attached to it, that skew the film in some odd way if you know what I mean.  Watch this movie!  We will hear about this movie more come awards season."
No Name,3.5,"This was better than I expected it to be, but it was a little too heavy handed on performances. It would have been far more interesting going into Nosferatu's origin. The gypsy scenes and dream sequences were the most interesting parts of this movie. They gloss over the Demeter voyage pretty quickly, probably too quickly. Far too much time spent on the Hardings, which are not interesting whatsoever. They could have cut 2-3 scenes within that house and spent more on Von Franz or the creatures origin. That would have bumped up the score."
No Name,0.5,"Absolutely disappointed. Werner Herzogs Nosferatu was a masterpiece, all this was was a distasteful overuse of special effect and jumpscares. The movie doesn‚Äôt feel haunting at all nor was I able to feel sad or moved by any of its characters. It didn‚Äôt convey any of the themes of the original. I never felt sad for Nosferatu himself nor scared for any of his victims. The acting was mediocre at best (except Willem Dafoe he was pretty good) and the effects were heavily overused. The character design of Nosferatu was over exaggerated the music was over exaggerated. If I would have watched this movie alone I would have turned it off before even getting through the first halve. The movie was disgusting and scary but never haunting or wary. What a shame"
No Name,4.5,"A hauntingly beautiful retelling of old mythos that will certainly go down as a modern classic, in no short part to Eggers' direction and the fiery performance from Willem Dafoe."
No Name,3.5,"Beautifully shot, great dialogue and excellent performances. It's incredibly atmospheric and ticks all the 'Dracula' boxes. Not scary though."
No Name,4.5,"I really love photography, also how the director use the darkness to create suspense."
No Name,0.5,This movie was confusing and boring. The plot was hard to follow along with and multiple aspects don‚Äôt make sense. Beautiful cinematography but that‚Äôs the only positive with the movie. Save your money and skip this one.
No Name,4,Great horror movie and the story is similar to the previous ones
robertjonfox,5,"I‚Äôve seen more vampire movies than I can count. Some of them have creeped me out a little bit. This is the first vampire movie that actually horrified and frightened me. Everything depicted is so dark and I was drawn into the madness of the characters immediately. Count Orlok is for every moment a looming darkness bringing madness, disease and death on an epic scale. His desire to consume, posses, and destroy all life brings on a feeling of despair and desperation. This is a masterpiece. Definitely in my top 10 movies of all time."
I liked it.,3,Was weird and kind of slow until the end.
Anthony M,5,absolutely loved great movie amazing performances another amazing fill by Robert Edgars
No Name,2.5,"Despite the wealth of literature and culture on which this film could have drawn, this film delivers a thin, disjointed and plodding storyline, punctuated by the occasional OTT gratuitous scene. While the cinematography impresses - kudos to the team for that - the acting really does not. Bill (the Count) and Nicholas (Thomas) gave good performances, but many of the rest of the cast turn in seriously amateur performances and feel just poorly cast. The humdrum dialogue may not have assisted. Ultimately, a visually interesting film, but lacking in any depth or finesse. One viewing more than enough."
Spencer R,5,"It is important to remember, when one is considering watching this movie, that is a gothic horror film. Gothic in the classic sense - stark contrasts, bleak world/weather, tragic love, a world where god exists but is absent. All that in mind, this is an amazing film: it makes fresh the original story and the concept of vampires as villainous monsters and predators rather than a love-interest."
Masterpiece,4,"Acting absolutely superb. Capturing the historical era enchanting and real. Fascinating seeing director and production‚Äôs creative eyes on how the vampire should look. Original breathtaking makeup which was spooky and encited fear. I was disappointed at the end. Where is Ellen‚Äôs soul? Did she have one?  Was she dark from another life? In spite of, it‚Äôs A masterpiece."
Ethel,4,Its a good popcorn movie and good cinematic performance.
Stephen R,5,"Before even the credits started this movie is captivating. The cinematography is beautiful, and the story is different enough from the classic Dracula to keep the suspense going strong. This should be considered Robert Eggers' masterpiece."
Laurie,4,I like the fact that they are taking vampires back to a scary darkness.
No Name,5,Amazing Cinematography with shots reminiscent of the original. Down right uncomfortable and weird. I bloody loved it!
No Name,2.5,Nosferatu would have been more compelling with better editing.
Synde,2,The script was not emotionally evocative- well other than disgust. Costumes and set were beautifully done but the acting seemed more like a high school production than an A list movie.
Pat C,2,I truly wanted to like this but it‚Äôs ridiculous.
No Name,5,"Nosferatu is nothing short of a haunting, cinematic triumph. From its chilling visual effects to its breathtaking cinematography, this film is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling. Nicholas Hoult delivers a tour de force performance, commanding every scene he's in with an intensity and depth that elevates the entire film. Aaron Taylor Johnson, while serviceable, doesn‚Äôt quite reach the same heights, but the overall impact of the cast remains phenomenal. 

To those dismissing it as ""slow,"" I say this: not every film needs to pander with relentless action and hollow spectacle. Some stories are meant to simmer, drawing you in with their intricacies and emotional weight. Hollywood, take notes‚Äîthis is the standard. Nosferatu isn‚Äôt just a movie; it‚Äôs an experience, and one we need more of."
Chris,1.5,Slow start and horrible acting
No Name,4,"I enjoyed this movie ‚Äî if you aren‚Äôt familiar with Robert Eggers you may have had the wrong expectations going in. Interestingly it was still not exactly what I expected (I had been looking forward to this movie for a few months), but in a good way. Acting is really good. If you are a movie lover and just want to try something a little different, I definitely recommend this movie."
No Name,4,It‚Äôs slow but beautifully gothic and very dark. Nicholas Hoult has had quite a 2024.
TK,2,"Not what I hoped for... excessively long, dark and horrific.  Even familiar with the plot it was difficult to follow, at the end my reaction was ""all this was so dragged out for... whaaat?  They just didn't sell it.
High marks for costumes and set design, wouldn't watch it again."
Jonathan V,5,Willem Dafoe steals the show. Great writing and very eerie scenary
W McGregor,2,"Too long, not suspenseful, not frightening. Watch Coppolas Dracula, or better yet, the original silent version. Willam Dafoes performance was the only highlight of the movie."
Ryan C,5,Best Movie of the Year (aside from DUNE 2 ofc)
Buford,3,"I was hoping for more action than what I saw. Also, it was thinly based on the Keanu Reeves movie from years ago but not as good. There was potential but never came through."
Luis,3,Great setting but it‚Äôs a rehash of Dracula
No Name,4.5,"People are moaning because it has a slow start...these people don't understand film and what makes a good film. They want The Rock to pop up to say some slop and then there is a slop reference to some other film that you remember.

A slow start works for the story, it's good to build up the movie but Jesus does it ramp up! It's kinda comforting in a weird way too, you'll understand if you have seen and enjoyed Eggers other films. It's just good to watch a well made film where everyone is glad to be there and where everyone wants to take their time to make it without cutting corners.

If you don't like Eggers other work, then cool, skip this, go and watch Mufasa or wait for Captain America : A Test Screening Result #57 That is Nothing And By Someone Who Wishes They had Joe Johnsons Creativity. If you like Eggers, enjoy and see it again and again."
No Name,2.5,"While there is some beautiful cinematography and framing, there's little of substance. It's not suspenseful enough to be horror and doesn't have enough character to be dramatic. What we're left with feels stylish and poetic but ultimately meaningless."
No Name,1.5,"A dull, lifeless take on the story‚Äîand utterly devoid of any fright."
No Name,1,"unfortunately, did not Nosferatu enough (or sometimes a little bit too much since some scenes are almost exactly like the 1979 movie with the great Klaus Kinski :‚Äô) and consisted of gory jump scares with little intrigue. Willem Dafoe played great though (came on the screen about 2/4 into it though and ultimately could not safe it) and earned the movie that one star."
Michelle O,5,"Excellent gothic horror, beautiful cinematography, outstanding settings and acting. A perfect movie for this genre. Makes me think of The VVitch."
No Name,5,"Robert Eggers absolutely nailed this re-making of a legendary, classic film. Every performance was incredible, and it was so BEAUTIFULLY shot."
Preston A,4.5,Very parallel to the 1922 version which was great to see. Obviously it was done to fit the modern era of film as opposed to the silent version in '22. Actors did a phenomenal job. Very entertaining especially comparing the two films almost 100 years apart.
Mollie L,3,Very slow. They could easily take 30 minutes off.
No Name,2.5,"Looks beautiful, and the first 40 mins are promising, but then it goes downhill fast and becomes ponderous and rather boring, with an unengaging story and characters you don't care about. 
I enjoyed The Witch & The Lighthouse, but with this and The Northman, Eggars has proven that he needs to work with a professional scriptwriter if he is going to attempt to make mainstream films. Or go back to making really good art films."
Chris,1,"was expecting more out of this movie, disappointed."
No Name,3.5,"A well constructed, staged and acted version of a story we've seen so many times. Unlike some nepo-babies, the lead can actually act. Predictable but well executed."
No Name,5,"Dark, creepy and beautifully shot! Go and watch!"
Salvador B,0.5,"Remakes most of the time fail. This is the case of Nosferatu in my humble opinion. Poor performances of most of the cast, no credibility at all. Didn't like it and I had big expectations about it. I stay with the original. Not recommendable at all."
No Name,4,"This movie stays with you. 

It's been over a week, and i've thought about it every day. 

It's visually striking and gorgeous. The sets, costumes, lighting, cinnematography are all top notch.

The acting is stellar pretty much all the way around.

It's not a jump scare movie. It's a haunting, slow burning, suspenseful movie. 

My only gripe, is that I think it overstayed its welcome a bit with it's run  time. maybe 20-30 mins less, it might have been perfect. At the same time...it's the slow paced shots, that really build the suspense and dread and fear in this film...so double edged sword there. 

I'd def recommend to anyone already a fan of Eggers, probably his best, and most accessible film so far. 

Id recommend to anyone really."
No Name,5,Graphically beautiful as well as dark and disturbing. I loved it. I think it's a movie I'll watch more than once.
No Name,1.5,"It is a visually beautiful movie and the acting is excellent. That being said, it is very boring. There are a few good scenes where there is noticeable tension building but overall I struggled to stay awake."
No Name,3,"This movie has many amazing things about it, and some fan disservice as well. The way it was shot, the score and the acting are great in this movie. The gore was not horrible, but there. A few jump points to give you that thrill. My biggest problem with this film was the pacing. It plodded around in too many place. The story was mostly dracula, with a few bits of nosferatu like names and locations, but fairly well done."
Magpie,4,"The gorgeous, atmospheric first hour was worth the price of admission! I agree with another reviewer who said its definitely a film to appreciate (at least the first time) on the big screen. I felt completely transported. The scenery, costumes, hairstyles, and period furniture: chefs kiss. An extra bonus: the good guys and gals have cats!
The second hour is more of a wind-up of the story ‚Äî you can only build dread and atmosphere for so long.:) So very glad I saw it first in a theater!"
No Name,5,As someone who has watched the original 1922 version I am very satisfied with this remake. It somehow managed to scare me with it's performances and it's cast. I am not a fan of the moustache but it doesn't matter.
Angel,5,This movie was an absolute masterpiece. They chose the right actors to play these characters and tell the story of Nosferatu.
No Name,1,"No no no, waste of my money and time. Title suggests scary movie right!?!, Not scary at all, zero, niente, nada. So predictable. Basically a vampire, some bloodied makeup and a few bites mostly surrounding a couple and a few ugly facial expressions. I could make a better movie, what da heck"
No Name,3,"Set pieces and score were great and a few truly scary/unsettling scenes. But I just found myself comparing it to Bram Stoker's Dracula throughout, which is a far superior movie. Serious over-acting by LRD, comical at times.  But honestly the movie would have been pretty dull without her over-acting so who knows."
Paul A,0.5,"Meh! This movie was more gross than scary. Like the saying goes - less is more, so instead of using  many disgusting graphics just because you can, it doesn't mean that you should. While the look of the movie and its sets were very good, the final product is overshadowed by it catering to the gross special effects and what I thought was a lack of true scares."
No Name,5,"I loved the dark atmosphere. I already have seen the silent movie and the one made by Herzog, I loved them all, that one is no exception. It‚Äôs paced at it should be. It was such a relief to watch a good movie with all the crap that came out these last years."
Christy I,5,Excellent acting. Will win awards!
John,1,Too much that brought too little. Bored to death watching this movie.
Laura,1,Was very graphic gory and awful.. felt the devil was there . My son who read the original Dracula book Son loved it  because it goes with the 1922 Dracula book.
Rikki,4,"I found the movie definitely interesting. I had not seen the original film so I went into it only knowing the story of Dracula, and I did see that there were similarities but some major differences. Overall I thought it was a well done movie and kept the viewer engaged."
No Name,4.5,"The score, the cinematography, and the atmosphere of this movie are exquisite.  This is a Dracula that invokes true existential dread.  The use of light and shadows is a wonderful callback to an older style of movie.  Despite what I would consider an uneven performance from the lead actress, this is one of the best horror films I have seen recently and is quite worthy of the biggest screen possible."
No Name,1.5,"Terrible story written here, the acting and the visuals were fine but the story. 
What has happen in this generation, why doesn‚Äôt story tellers know how to tell decent stores anymore, why are they so bad, there are many years of good stories, why not follow or improve the good/proven methods. 
I don‚Äôt recommend this movie. It try‚Äôs to be artful but come out as dumb and foolish,"
Joshua,0.5,"I fell asleep, 2 hours of talking with 30 seconds of horror stories thrown in the middle. Where are the good movies at"
MyraEllen,0.5,Boring and slow. Very very slow! I kept waiting for it to get better. Never did. Visually beautiful. Terribly slow story line.
No Name,3.5,I loved the mood. It's a little bit boring but it is to create the mood.
KATIE,1,most ridiculous movie ever
Sam,2.5,"This movie feels like it's 4 hours long.  The movie has beautiful scenes and great acting, but it drags and isn't very entertaining. The disappointment is, it wasn't good. I'm a fan and this was an enormous let down.  2 thumbs down and a couple stars bc i do want to see the classics again."
NH,2.5,"Not a bad movie not a good movie, just a movie"
No Name,4.5,"The first half of the film was an absolute master work. Unfortunately I found some of the liberties with the plot at the end annoying and did not make sense. Why not go to his house in the day and kill him. Why wait until midnight, it stopped making sense once the hero husband returned but they sat around doing nothing. Still the film as a whole was brilliant."
No Name,0.5,"Nearly walked out of the cinema for only the 2nd time in my life, slow burn where the candle didn‚Äôt even move. Great actors couldn‚Äôt even help this be a good movie."
No Name,4.5,Amazing visuals - adds to the lore in a satisfying way - certainly pays homage to the vampire films that came before it but not in a pandering way.
Julia,3,"Pretty predictable-however , the costumes were great, it added to the enjoyment of the movie,"
No Name,5,"An atmospheric love letter to Gothic horror that blends inspirations from Bram Stoker's Dracula and the 1922 Nosferatu film. The integration of folklore was delightful, and the attention to detail on costuming and language impeccable. While not a movie for everyone, there is plenty of depth and detail to sink your teeth into."
No Name,4,Oscar nominations for set and costume design I hope. Super fun and disgusting movie that unpacks the lore of an old tale while indulges it with embellishments that entertain.
No Name,5,NOW thats what i call movie ....i loved it so much i would go back over and over again to see the movie...Best Way To Bring in The New year...
Katiekat115,0.5,There were ships all that needs to be said. DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS
No Name,3.5,"Exquisite, gothic detail in a subdued Nosferatu counterpoint to the saturated colour and 90's excess of Frances Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Simon McBurney (Herr Knock) is giddily, gleefully enchanted by the curse laid upon him by Count Orlok, scampering free from convention, chewing the scenery and other entities on his way.

In contrast, other characters seem tragically hidebound by paternalistic, class and gender constructs and hierarchies in this story, and something more ancient and occult but equally destructive in the case of the Count.  Fuller character development could have lifted the energy and pace of what feels like a very long film."
No Name,4.5,"Great acting, wonderful cinematography and sets; William Dafoe will get a nomination. Good pace to the film with character development; I think some of the reviews here were expecting a marvel movie."
Juan,3.5,Was not scary enough
Lana,4,What a beautiful movie! Set in Victorian Europe with beautiful costumes and sets that gives a look at the splendor of the era. I was worried the story would be redundant since it's been told so many times before but they did a good job with it. The cast was brilliant! Good job!
Ella,0.5,Corny humor if you catch it. Monster was very distracting to look at and take seriously. Actors did great but overall story line while keeping close to book did not translate well to screen with morbid and dark themes.
No Name,2,"Soooo slow. Love the actors yet thought the acting was sub-par and almost laugh worthy when being serious, Saw several people walk out. I thought about it!"
No Name,0.5,"reading the reviews i wondered how many were paid by JD to promote his daughter....

Dead slow flow, awful dumb plot, awful graphic, bad acting. Waste of 2.15 hours.  The actual content is at most 30 min and even that should be dead boring.  Absolutely the worst crap of bag in the last 10 years"
Jarrod L,1.5,Long and boring. Story really didnt make sense. The ending was very weird and lacking information.
Jose M,4.5,Absolute great performances all around a must see for those who enjoy the mythology of/around vampires and Dracula
Mina Murray,3.5,"This ain‚Äôt Gary Oldman‚Äôs romantic version of Dracula, but Bill Skarsgard definitely brings the horror factor to the screen.  I loved Robert Egger‚Äôs version of Count Orlok. My only dislike was the pacing and color panel. I kept dozing off in the theater.  I would have rather waited to have watched it at home and enjoy it much better."
No Name,0.5,"I would give this a 0 star if i could. Half of my cinema slept through it, the other half scrolled on their phones and I can't blame them. I blame the people who upvoted it and tricked me into watching this.

The visuals were okay if only I didn't have to see 150 panning shots while people I don't care about, know anything about try to be scared.

I don't even remember their names, the characters, but its not even applicable they have like three pieces of dialogue and actions that they repeat, more like talking moving plot devices.

A main lead (a forgot the brides name) is just crashing out for the 2hrs of runtime. The second lead is being chased by the vampire crashout who is after his wife. That is the whole movie nothing else. If everything besides the last 10 minutes occured the outcome would've been the exact same.

I would write more but this movie has taken too much of my time."
Kristine,4,A kind of film you should see in a movie theater. It was dark and eerie. Strong acting from the cast.
Jove,5,Nosferatu was amazing! So glad I saw it in IMAX! It was in incredible experience for me and my partner!
Daniel,5,"I love it, But I know replay value. You only need to see it once. But was a great movie."
Gregory L,5,This is one of the best vampire films ever made in my opinion.  Up there with ‚ÄúLet The Right One In‚Äù as my favorite. The cinematography was stellar. Great cast. Great story. The directory of photography is amazing. Scary as hell and definitely NOT for children. 17+ for this one. The acting was amazing. Takes place in the mid-1800‚Äôs Germany. I usually don‚Äôt like period pieces but this was brilliant. Bound to be a classic. Loved it.
No Name,4.5,"I truly enjoyed this movie so much. It's not for everyone, but if you like a slow burn, excellent cinematography and incredible Gothic style, you'll love it. 
The true strong point for me is the cinematography. The way so many shots are framed with the characters facing the camera directly is very interesting, and sometimes unnerving, and the shift from cool tones to warm after Orlok is dead is a nice touch. The scenery is beautiful and Gothic, huge recommend for horror fans"
Rusoneko,1,poor acting but still ok
Josh,5,"Movie was FREAKY ash,  my guy Thomas is a cuck thoüòî! 10/10!!!"
Kris A,5,Amazing cinematogtaphy.  Great acting and just outstanding. .   A must see.
Alan T,5,Very well acted and bone chilling. Held my interest for over 2 hours.
No Name,0.5,Gag that's all I need to say
Richard H,2,"Slow moving, difficulty hearing the dialogue. It was not clear what the title meant and what was the curse explanation. Not recommended. no"
Nicholas,1,DO NOT WATCH THIS ITS SO BORING -10000000
No Name,4,"Incredible casting, Everyone‚Äôs performance was exceptional. Lily Rose made the movie. Willem Dafoe marvelous as always. Christian Taylor great job. I do wish Count orlock‚Äôs Castle was not such a fever dream. And then the movie jumped around too much post orlocks Castle. Was hoping for a more substantive chain of events. Good movie! Wish you would‚Äôve seen more and understood more of count orlock. I do have to keep in mind as a fan of Bram Stoker‚Äòs novel Dracula, I‚Äôm Constantly detecting the novels foundation in this movie so I expect more of it, But must keep in mind they subjectively chose bits and pieces to make Nosferatu close enough, but it‚Äôs own thing So I can‚Äôt be so critical when it doesn‚Äôt follow Brahm Stoker‚Äôs novel or go as in depth."
No Name,1.5,"Really boring. Uninteresting. Superficial, really no depth to the plot. Was trying really hard to do something, but I'm not quite sure what."
No Name,1,"I've never left a movie review, but this movie was so horrendously bad that I had to give it a 1 star. My dog could write a better movie walking across a keyboard."
No Name,4,Great movie! Could‚Äôve been scarier though.
CW,2,It was slow and below our expectations. I had high hopes!
Michael S,3.5,Movie is beautifully shot and acting. Not very scary though.
No Name,5,Dark and gothic and beautiful. Not for everyone
No Name,2,"Nosferatu feels a tad redundant and poorly paced, all while Eggers furthers his reputation as the king of unintelligible dialogue."
Larissa,5,Cinematic masterpiece
Wil,0.5,I fell asleep twice.
EasyE,5,It had a great story line. It did not have any Boos in it but kept me on my toes to see what would happen next. Great job
Natanya  G.,5,"Such a great movie! Better than I expected. Story line was phenomenal. I loved the jump scares, too. Wasnt expecting that.  Not a dull moment in this movie."
Apryl S,1,"It was not scary, it was just gross!"
Seeds,5,"Nice touches of Cinna photography and nods to previous films, especially the original Nosferatu."
No Name,1,"Absolute rubbish. Boring. Interminably long. Looked great. Sound track fabulous but‚Ä¶.. you need more then just pretty wallpaper when you sit for 2 hours in a cinema. Clearly a lot of money spent on it. This was not a gothic classic more like a Carry on Screaming revamp. True horror buffs watch the 1930s Nosferatu original. True horror and cinematic brilliance beyond its time, haunting and beautiful. This version Nosferstu reminded me of a rather unattractive version of Burt Reynolds complete with seventies rash and bad skin conditions. üëéüèø"
Michael,5,Outstanding cinematography both visually and auditory. Paired with career defining performances from the entire ensemble makes for one of the modern horror classics. Incredibly intense through and through would warn against going if you‚Äôre squeamish.
Gabby,1,Terrible movie. Couldn‚Äôt wait for it to be over..
Daniel,5,Must watch! Great movie!
Ms T,4,Atmospheric. Great interpretation of the story. Perfect casting.
No Name,3.5,"Beautiful film. I really loved the creature and costume design. There are parts of the story that I feel needed more fleshing out, specifically Ellen's history. I am hoping that a rewatch will show me new details I missed my first time. All the acting was fantastic."
Jonah,5,"I‚Äôm absolutely speechless‚Ä¶ this film is absolutely unreal. The performances, the cinematography, the music, the set design, the chilling story, and the nearly claustrophobic atmosphere‚Ä¶ all of it makes Nosferatu one of the greatest vampire movies ever. Robert Eggers is a master of his craft and I believe he will go down as a legendary filmmaker."
No Name,4,"My only argument for this movie not getting five stars is how long it was. And I like a good movie, this one just dragged and dragged."
Gabe,5,"The movie was fun and tantilizing, very gritty, and true to source material."
Jennifer,2,Pretty slow. Too long.
No Name,5,A masterpiece. The cinematography and pulling in other horror genres and lore all combined with brilliant acting and and unsettling and gritty acting overall film
Tyler H,1.5,"A strange mix of being too careful and being constantly overblown. No new take on the material, just a more detailed rendering that feels like watching someone else play a video game. A lot of sound and fury signifying nothing."
No Name,2,"I watch bad movies and good movies all the time.  But this movie, surpassed my expectations of what I thought could be boring.  I thought as some point something would happen in the plot, only to find nothing.  It wasn‚Äôt scary, and it wasn‚Äôt super interesting.  All the actors did very well, but you can only do so much with a slog of a script"
Nora,1,"It was very slow and boring almost fell asleep. 
I also couldn't understand what they were saying."
No Name,5,Creepy good slow at 1st 10 minutes but picks up to very creepy and scary great acting
No Name,3.5,Solid movie for Christmas.  Slow-burner with excellent cinematography.
Francisco,3,"Unsettling, acting was phenomenal, but this movie really needed subtitles all the way through in order to understand what the characters are saying, especially Count Orlock."
No Name,5,"If it's vampirish, I'm going to watch/read it.  I've suffered through many lame renditions.  I believe this film will become known as a modern masterpiece.  Perfect üëçüëç"
Michelle,1.5,"The look of the film was really good, but there really wasnt anything all that different about it to make it worthwhile as a remake. It was much too long, and all three of us were getting bored throughout the film. I would much rather rewatch the 1979 remake, or Coppolas Bram Stokers Dracula, any day. As a vampire movie/ horror fan I feel let down."
Constantin M,2,"I love all the actors, I expected much more from this movie."
Edward K,0.5,"as a fan of horror, I was beyond disappointed, zero scare factor, don't know who approved this disaster, bring ear plugs!"
See A Lot,2.5,"Somewhat interesting and somewhat confusing.  At times, it was difficult to understand what the actors were saying."
Dell,1,Very slow movie and boring. Hard to understand in the beginning
Keith V,4.5,Dark. Creepy. Beautifully shot. A real vampire movie. No one sparkles in this movie
Marco,5,one of the best classic horror movies in recent times
Paige J,5,"I loved it. It's a great take on the 1922 Nosferatu. Perfect Cult Gothic Romanceüñ§. If you get it, you get it. If you don't your loss ü§∑"
No Name,3,"CG/ some things to like and some not.  

The girl is great, which was a nice surprise since i don‚Äôt like her fathers acting, and she convincingly  conveys the tortured reality she lives with.
But the vampire character is taken too far and made into a supersize super demon.  Earlier versions of this story ie. the one by Herzog, made the plot more memorable by portraying  the vampire as equally tortured as his ultimate victim. 

There are a few dazzling visual moments in this film but there are also many phony CGI scenes that like the oversized monster, only serve to dilute the good stuff you‚Äôve just enjoyed watching."
No Name,4,"Really enjoyed this take on the storyline. Proper gothic horror. Moody, dark, atmospheric. Acting was good, cinematography was fantastic‚Ä¶ truly beautiful at times. Did not think it was ‚Äúslow‚Äù at all. 
Would (and will) watch again."
No Name,5,If you love or like ‚Äútwilight‚Äù you‚Äôre not going to like this movie. If you love or like ‚ÄúClockwork Orange‚Äù you‚Äôre going to love this movie.
JPG,5,I loved it!! Lily-Rose Depp‚Äôs performance was spellbinding. The rest of the cast also did a wonderful job. Robert Eggers nailed another phenomenal film! A+
V,1.5,Unfortunately the trailer was the best part of the movie  very very very slow
John,5,Perfect from beginning to end.
leonel,4,"good movie, good pace, good plot! i enjoyed it"
No Name,1,While I know many critics loved it I did not. In fact I was blown away by how much I truly disliked it. I am of the opinion playing Nosferatu as a hideous creature with so little lighting as not to be able to see his face is ludicrous. This is clearly not how to make this an entertaining want to attend movie. Many people in my showing walked out after only about an hour. The movie is not worth any of your time or money. Willem Dafoe is good as Van Helsing but the rest of the movie doesn‚Äôt support his excellent effort. Don‚Äôt bother.
Rick,4,Nice take on the Dracula story. Well done. Long movie. Enjoy being on the edge of my seat every now and then.
No Name,2.5,"It was fine. Not particularly scary or wild. For all the hype, I was really dissapointed. Felt a bit like a generic horror movie."
No Name,4,"It's oddly both very stylish and beautiful while at times being unnecessarily grotesque and/or ridiculous. Luckily it achieves the former far more often than it stumbles into the latter, and some of the ridiculousness is actually enjoyable. Meanwhile, Willem Dafoe adds an extra layer of campy comic relief, which was unexpected, yet highly welcome. 8/10"
anthony s,1.5,Movie was mediocre at best not worth going to theaters for.
No Name,1,"Extremely overly sexualized and slow, non stop scenes that are completely unneeded for the plot whatsoever. It seems as a desperate man wrote this on a wattpad... Everyone else I watched this with also hated it, nothing good as shown in the trailers."
Christine  R,5,Absolutely loved it!
No Name,4,"This movie is a good old throwback to a well told simmering horror story. A great and memorable entry into the vampire movie lore. Everyone in the cast is in fine form. Dark and dreary, just excellent production values."
Austin,4,Cringey but satisfying.
LCH,1,First time I ever fell asleep in the theater
Richard,1.5,Somehow the made this vampire boring!  I gave up 90 minutes into the film.
kenneth,2.5,Thought it was boringexpected more!! The  Dracula movie with Gary Oldman was much much better!!!
Peter d,5,"Original, frightening, and awesome!"
Kristin,5,"Amazing, obsessed, gorgeous, hot."
No Name,1,Did not enjoy this movie.  Started out ok but downhill after an hour or so.  Too much blood vomit just got unnecessary.   üëé
No Name,4,"Mostly done in close-ups and medium shots, scenes and sets appear gothic and haunting but lack scares contrary to the general consenses of critics. The story is rather choppy unless you know it well. The vampire looks is human rather than vampirish unlike the original and despite all the hype. Great performances by Nicholas Hoult et al. A highly engrossing watch."
Jimmy,3,Good Story a little hard to follow and not that scary
Matthew B,5,Good movie great buy! Must see if interested in Dracula lore
C CROM,0.5,"This vampire sucked. My husband is a huge vampire fan, but I had to keep waking him up to watch it. One of the most interesting things about vampires is their complexity this one had none he was just a monster and not a scary one. The cultures portrayed and languages used were also boring for today's culturally diverse audience. Other than the horrible treatment of children, I felt like, who cares - about this vampire or those who were bitten? Maybe the director should stick to designing the film was more like separate frames than a cohesive, interesting story."
Joe,5,If you don‚Äôt see how this movie is a beautiful masterpiece then you suck at life.
Susan H,2,"Cinematography was good. Some cool shots and effects. Overall, it was boring and too long. Some scenes were laughably bad. There didnt seem to be much character development and you really dont care about any of the characters in the movie. I was excited to see the movie and really wanted to like it. Disappointed."
Diana,1,"Very slow movie, doesnt ever pick up much.  Basically its a remake of the 1920s Nosferatu.  Didnt like how they portrayed the count in this movie.  I still prefer Bram Stokers Dracula from the 90s."
John S,5,"Beautifully shot, excellent acting all around, very intense. I've read that some complained that they felt it was too long. Never felt its length at all. We're going to see it again."
No Name,5,"Robert Eggers did the dirty job, he brought the vampires back to their evil essence, driven by animalistic instincts etc. The vampires are not the ones from Twilight not the ones from Anne Rice. This movie is a kick in the ass of fake, vampires from Twilight and Anne Rice books."
No Name,5,Spellbinding cinematography. Fantastic acting breathing new life into a classic story. It's dark but captivating.
Lynn S,1,"Super slow, the count was terrible, you need subtitles to understand what hes saying."
Jane B,3,It was filmed to dark. Made it hard to see things.
Amy,4,"Storyline eloquently draws the viewer as the acting is superb. The lead actress holds an outstanding performance. Appreciate the cinematography and viewpoints of the director.  However, they became a little too routine for me 3/4 way through the film. Approaching doors and doorways became an overused theme. Honoring the time period was lovely.  However, William Dafoes character suddenly appears without truly understanding his role or connection. 30 minutes could be cut from this film and would earn another star from this viewer."
Kimberly,5,My husband absolutely loves this movie.  He is a huge fan of Bram Stoker!
Seth,5,"Robert Eggers continues to expand his talents with his latest film, Nosferatu. Visually dark, strongly cast, and narratively compelling. Eggers fills every scene with morbid dread for the title creature. This film bares a bold reminder why we go to the movies!"
No Name,4,"Beautifully shot and Eggers is one gain amazing with his world building. It's somewhat scary absolutely dark and occasionally pretty twisted. Att see nd of the day it's just Nosferatu, again. But still worth the watch."
Christina,3,"Great acting, cinematography, but it is a very very dark movie- visually"
Dedric,3,The 1992 Dracula with Keanu Reeves was much better.
No Name,4.5,"A superb retelling of the classic story that both goes back to the source in a way that even most Dracula remakes don't and yet still feels fresh thanks to more focus on the importance of the Mme Harker character and the extent to which she has agency over what transpires. The cinematography and sound design are fantastic, plus the central performances really sell scenes that might come off as comical in the hands of a less capable director."
No Name,4.5,"Very good atmosphere. Definitely gives you the chill of horror and feeling of uneasiness that Nosferatu should invoke. Some of the scenes felt unnecessary and some dialogue come off as unnatural at times, but definitely make me jump.  I loved the way the ending was done, and the cinematography of the entire film was gorgeous."
Boomer V,3,Very slow for first half of movie. Entire movie was set in very dark surroundings. A bit of a snoozefedt.
No Name,2.5,"Scenery was chewed as if by a thousand rats!

Visually the film is very good, but that doesn't save it from the horriblely over-acted performances. It also somehow, as a horror movie, fails to generate any real sense of fear or dread. It's just boring."
Christie,5,I‚Äôm still very confused but it was good
No Name,4.5,"While the lighting was often a little over-dark and the heavy, rasping breathing tone used for Orlok is a bit hit-or-miss, the movie is otherwise extremely well-shot, and does an excellent job of creating an aura of oppressive Gothic fear."
No Name,2.5,It should have been better.
Brian P,1.5,"Largely expected, repetitive, and redundant. We dont need to keep making the same movies, folks."
Michael A Penk,0.5,Campy acting and enough with the shadows
No Name,3,"Gorgeous, well-acted and stylish.  But... sadly kinda boring."
Robin,5,GReatest horror movie of 2024
A,3,"Very disturbing and more exorcism than vampire... A bit of a deceiving movie, main character doesn‚Äôt complete his arc, unsatisfying ending. Beautiful cinematography and great acting, but the plot left us wanting more"
No Name,0.5,"This was the worst movie I‚Äôve seen in a while. The timing for the music, especially suspenseful scenes, was so off the mark. It feels like they read some really bad fanfiction or monsterf*cker romance novels, picked out the cringiest parts and threw that into a movie. The heavy breathing was more annoying than scary or hot, and the mustache was‚Ä¶ a choice. Cheap jump scares. They did not have a single alternative or goth person on their staff to direct them as to what gothic actually is, and what goths like. As a historical costuming lover, the costuming is accurate to the period in ENGLAND not GERMANY, however completely lacked vibrancy which I guess you could interpret as artistic choice, but Tim Burton has used bright pops of color against dark backgrounds and it‚Äôs still goth. Also, a subtle German accent would not have been difficult to understand and would have been more immersive. I constantly forgot they were in Germany.
As a goth, this was not for the goths. This is the movie equivalent of a big titty goth girlfriend for the general public that likes the aesthetic of goths but won‚Äôt bring them home to mom.
I could not help but laugh at so many cringy parts of the movie. The panning cameras took far too long. The stereotypical convulsions were annoying and not well done. The sex scenes were BAD. Willum Dafoe‚Äôs monologues were well executed and it was surprising that they were in such a poor movie. And the cats and rats (so many live rats for this movie! That was cool!) being a through line. They weren‚Äôt subtle with the symbolism of the cats hunting the rats, but my god they weren‚Äôt subtle with any of their foreshadowing or symbolism and I‚Äôm an autistic who is terrible with symbolism.
Also the squelching sound during the sex scene was nauseating. I CANNOT understand why this has such a high rating. Lily-Rose, girl, you will do amazing things with better scripts. I believe in you. Why was there so much hype for this after it came out?"
No Name,0.5,"Beautifully wrapped, but nothing to present."
Kevin,1.5,Nothing special at all.  Should have waited for when it shows up on sci-fi channel
No Name,4,This is a gorgeous gothic tale with sumptuous visuals and excellent performances throughout. I will say however that I couldn't help but become bothered by my numb posterior halfway through which dampened the experience slightly. I think it could have done with being trimmed down a little or have more scares or action to help the tone of the film meander better as I think the dreary mood became a little stagnent in the middle.
