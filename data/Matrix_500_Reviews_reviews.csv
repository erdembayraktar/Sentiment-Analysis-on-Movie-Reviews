Name,Rating,Review
No Name,5,"Fantastic movie, one of the great epics"
No Name,2,It‚Äôs not aged well. The action scenes are quite cringeworthy and the plot is advanced by characters who just tell you what their motives are.
Paul T,5,Best movie of all time
Chris,5,Amazing. Please bring more older movies back to the theater.
No Name,5,This first movie of the trilogy is an absolute masterpiece. Love it!
No Name,2.5,"It's a very enjoyable average movie. The cinematography, effects, message, villain,  and action are  all masterpieces. However that is not enough to make it a masterpiece of a movie. The characters, aside from the main agent(who is flawless I might add), were poorly written, very poorly  written. This movie's biggest problem: telling the audience something is different from explaining it to them. You can tell me the Neo is the chosen one, you can tell me that Morpheus views him as the chosen one, but you have to explain why. This movie saying ""well, it;s because Morpheus views him as one"" is not an explanation, because this movie established Morpheus's credibility. The romance was mediocre at best, at least you could tell it was going to happen unlike other movies that just shove it out of left it. I suppose that's something in this movie's favor, but it still doesn't elevate the romance out of nowhere. Addiotnally, this movie has what I like to call the ""pointless side characters problem"", when there's too many characters, poorly written, that just endlessly remove screen time from the main characters, leading to every single character(well almost in this case), being underdeveloped. I didn't even understand why Neo wanted to find the Matrix, this movie never once answered that question. It's also incomprehensible how he got so good at the Matrix. This is a critique one has to be careful of, because it could easily be thrown at every single sci-fi movie. Often times I think it's thrown around unjustifiably, but this movie is not one of those times. There is no logical reason why Neo should be able to beat the agent. BECAUSE THIS MOVIE NEVER EXPLAINED WHY HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE MATRIX, AND WHY HE WAS THE CHOSEN ONE! In Star Wars, Luke destroying the Death Star is justifiable, because the movie explained why he had the power of the force, and Obi-Wan helped him through the power of the force. You don't need some elaborate, 20 minute exposition, something as simple as what Star Wars did was enough. Another thing I will point out, the acting, ranges from bad to mediocre. I think Reeves was miscast in this role, which might be the biggest hot take in this review(which is a hot take in it of itself). His gives just a dry performance, which is not always a bad thing (works for Jon Wick), but it does not work for this movie. There is never an ounce of emotion shown in his face, and that really lower the quality of the movie. That pretty much goes for every character in this movie. Except for the Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving  gives a superb performance. It's exactly how a character like that is supposed to act. And his motivations were EXPLAINED. He wants to be free of the world he operates in, and by getting to Zion, he will achieve that. PERFECT! That was a 3 minute scene at most, maybe even a minute and a half. THAT'S ALL YOU NEED. I'm not even going to lie, I found myself rooting for him during the climax. This movie gave its villain(well maybe sub villain, since technically The Matrix is the villain), a motivation with an explanation, but not's main character.  HOW SAD IS THAT. Overall, it's just an average movie. If it wasn't for the villain, this movie would be a bad movie with great action, special effects, and great cinematography. Those things alone are not enough to make a movie good. Yes, without them a movie will be lowered in quality. But having a main character, whose motivations, and greatness are unexplained, poorly written side characters, a bland romance, and making your villain more lovable(EVEN THE MOTIVATIONS OF WHO HE WORKS FOR ARE EVIL) than your main character are flaws to great to make this movie anything more than mediocre."
No Name,3.5,"Whilst the visual effects used in this film hold up excellently to this day, it is let down by inconsistencies within its plot or premise and a massive lack of variation in the pacing of its fight scenes. Yet, it is home to some of the best scenes in movie history, and the concept which it attempts to explore is revolutionary for film-making. I admire that about it."
No Name,5,"It is a genius action film with an engaging and exciting plot. It is thrilling, well filmed, has great dialogue and Keanu Reeves best acting performance by far. Definitely one of the greatest examples of American action films."
No Name,0.5,Very silly storyline that lacked all credibility and all real human interest. Not for me thank you.
No Name,5,Legendary and ahead of it‚Äôs time!
No Name,5,One of the greatest movies of all time. Do yourself a favour and watch it.
jovan w,5,"One of the best Sci-Fi, Action, Philosophical movies ever made!"

No Name,5,GYATTTTTTTT I love this movie so much bruuuhhhh I'm bouta blowww everybody can get it onggg
No Name,5,worlds best movie!!!!
No Name,5,"Frenetico, reflexivo, tenso e maluquice desenfreada. Simplesmente 10/10. Espetacular wow konomoul"
No Name,5,First time I watched it it was an alright film nothing to special but I was impressed by CGI but now that I think about it now it's an absolute must see
No Name,5,"Forget the effects and ground-breaking effects, this is such a brilliant concept that asks questions about everything from AI to mortality, to self-consciousness to politics. Sheer brilliance!"
No Name,5,"Much taken from Hongkong films but we needed it to penetrate Hollywood so all is well...
I was so - of yeah, I know what's happening now when I first saw this!!! Great sci-fi."
No Name,5,"This movie is a classic. You must watch it asap. It is a bizarre concept about Plato's Allegory of the Cavern, and it is great. Just give it a try. Revolutionary for the time, and still is to this day."
jacqueline,5,still a great watch. holds up after 25 years!
No Name,2,"For the time the effects were good, Keanu's acting is very wooden.. I very over hyped film
It was original for it's time but nothing to make me want to rewatch."
No Name,4.5,"De mis favoritas de la historia con un guion incre√≠ble, fotograf√≠a y todo lo t√©cnico de la pel√≠cula es impecable, üëåüèº"
Willy,5,"Why are you reading this!!! Its the Matrix, what more do you need to know. Always worth a watch on the big screen."
No Name,5,"One of best movies of all time, need I say more?"
No Name,4.5,"This is literally my fave movie of all time. I've watched it again once a decade or so, and it still holds water as a great film. I also discover more inside jokes, metaphors and glitches in The Matrix. Superb acting performances from Reeves, Fishburne, Moss and Waving, and we all hate Joe and root for Agent Smith, or maybe that's just me .."
No Name,5,One of my favorite movies of all time.
No Name,5,"By FAR, my favorite Sci-Fi Movie of ALL time. It's got some of the smartest plot in any Movie. The Action is some of the best in cinema. I used to know every damn line in this damn Movie back when i was younger because i rewatched this Movie to death."
Danny Y,5,A movie everyone needs to see at least once!
Aron R,5,The Greatest Movie of ALL-Time
No Name,3.5,good movie really makes you really think. low key blew my mind
No Name,5,This movie is a classic. It was the launch of a whole new model of Sci-Fi. A must see for all generations. It was a pleasure to see this classic on the big screen. This movie will never get old in my eyes. It‚Äôs the ruler that is used to measure other movies that stem from its concepts.
No Name,5,Legendary! Keanu and Laurence was so good in this film.
No Name,5,"‚ÄúNot Science fiction, but a documentary is what you need to know about this film according to medical genius, Bruce Lipton‚Äù Wild when you understand so much of the sublime and subtle themes about the avatar in this movie ‚ÄúNEO is ONE‚Äù when you move The letters around and there‚Äôs lots of little things in the movie to point to him being self realized or  awake Like a shaman would be either way it‚Äôs an incredible film that set a standard like no other and says a lot of things that are worth looking at. It‚Äôs 100% on my tomato meter. Enjoy!"
No Name,4.5,"Honestly, this is one of the movies of all time. Ted is trapped in a dystopian, nightmare-ish computer program and he learns to use badass powers to defeat a bunch of guys who're probably all named Kieth, because nobody named Kieth is a good person."
No Name,5,"Genial, questionador, excepcional! Como obra de fic√ß√£o √© uma produ√ß√£o perfeitamente atual para os nossos dias que sempre ser√° uma fonte de ideias para uma sociedade inquieta."
No Name,4.5,A cornerstone of Sci-Fi. You don't need to watch the sequels. This stand superbly on its own.
No Name,5,Absolute classic! One of my favourites
No Name,4,"Slight childhood bias, but great film and story, a bit cheesy though"
No Name,5,"Just re-watched the 25th Anniversary release with my kids and the CGI hasn't aged well, but the story is still great and I love the challenging questions around choice/fate/reality that it poses and sets up to dig into more with the 2nd and 3rd movies!"
No Name,5,"Happy 25th anniversary Matrix. This was amazing in digital . I remember 99 like it was yesterday. Awesome fight scenes, Don Davis score, great cast. Keanu is the GOAT . Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is one of my favorite bad guys. Everyone dressed in a long coat and glasses after this movie. I miss the 90s so much and this was on film when it came out. 10/10 EPIC FANTASTIC. If you don't like the Matrix then I will give you the finger and go make your phone call ."
No Name,5,it was a pretty good movie I enjoyed it
No Name,5,How is this movie not at 99 percent?
No Name,5,This is a classic. When it first came out it was doing things that had never been done and got people really thinking. Great movie a must see
No Name,5,One of the best movies of our generation.
No Name,5,I think in retrospect it has become significant like a must-see classic. It blew our minds at the time and I still think it has relevancy and is enjoyable.
No Name,4.5,"Revisiting 'The Matrix' for its 25th anniversary feels like stepping into a cinematic experience that remains as relevant as ever. This film was ahead of its time, blending groundbreaking vfx with thought-provoking themes about reality, control, and technology. The Wachowskis crafted a world that feels more relatable today than ever, in an age where AI, virtual reality, and questions of individual autonomy are part of everyday conversation. The film's iconic action sequences, groundbreaking bullet-dodging effects, and philosophical tones make it a timeless piece of cinema. Watching it again, it‚Äôs clear 'The Matrix' was a blueprint for the now & future."
No Name,5,This movie is steeped in philosophy and Kungfu.
No Name,5,One of the best movies ever. Period.
No Name,4.5,"When my son and I went to see The Matrix for the first time in the theatre, back in 1999, we were blown away. It was literally the best movie we had ever seen! The combination of characters, special effects, storyline, atmosphere was outstanding. Truly a classic for all time! Enough said‚Ä¶"
No Name,5,"This is a dazzling, smart and highly entertaining action film."
No Name,4,thrilling but kind of cringy üíÄ
No Name,4.5,One of the most iconic movie ever! God bless Keanu.
No Name,5,Mind-blowing ! Must see. From the Golden Age of Sci-Fi.
No Name,5,Words cant describe how good this is
No Name,5,"Neo (Keanu Reeves) believes that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), an elusive figure considered to be the most dangerous man alive, can answer his question -- What is the Matrix? Neo is contacted by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a beautiful stranger who leads him into an underworld where he meets Morpheus. They fight a brutal battle for their lives against a cadre of viciously intelligent secret agents. It is a truth that could cost Neo something more precious than his life."
No Name,5,Very good movie. Sci-fi and greatly showed the potential possibilities of time and space.
No Name,5,The young people behind the film have done a great job and it can be seen in this film. I liked it very much.
No Name,5,One of the most iconic sci-fi movies and concept there is. Absolute classic
No Name,5,Ridiculously good. The last half of the movie is a complete thrill ride
No Name,5,Original screenplay. Great acting and choreography.
No Name,5,"A cinema classic, great storyline, plots, actings, action scenes and suspense."
No Name,5,"Deserves a perfect score, one of the best films ever made."
No Name,5,The original Matrix is beyond a doubt the best action sci-fi movie of its time.
No Name,5,The Matrix crafts the perfect surreality to make itself a timeless masterpiece.
No Name,5,"Best movie EVER MADE. Had the best philosophy, Cinematography, Colors, Style etc.
It was WAY ahead of it's time"
No Name,4,"An inventive, flashy action film that makes its worth from its amazing special effects that still hold up great today and its excellent action sequences."
No Name,4.5,The matrix programmed all science fiction movie fans to all watch and agree that this is one of the best science fiction movies ever made. With it‚Äôs reality-bending plot and groundbreaking visuals this movie will pull you into a conspiracy rabbit hole for you to enjoy.
No Name,5,"You think that‚Äôs air your breathing 
Just saw it for the 25th anniversary in theaters better then I remember definitely one of the greatest sci fi movies of all time 10/10"
No Name,5,noah:says the matrix is my favourite movie!
No Name,2.5,"I think the producers wanted to create another action film instead of exploring the idea of ""the matrix"" and that this is all fake and that we live in an illusion. It was a good idea, but they didn't know what to do with it."
No Name,5,Absoluta obra maestra en todos los aspectos
No Name,5,"My favorite movie of all time. How can‚Äôt it be. The fast paced, lovable graphics, and philosophical storyline make it a undoubted masterpiece"
No Name,2.5,"Yuppie office job venting movie.

Kind of like a high tech sci-fi shoot-em-up game.  Bullets apparently as harmless as peas from a pea shooter; punches are like mosquito bites.  I think with enough peas and mosquitoes, anyone would at least eventually die.  You know the reason: so they can put tons and tons of violence in without actually killing the characters off before milking them for all the theatrics they can.  Nothing original about that.  And just like in a fairy tale, at the end a magic kiss brings the prince back to life.
I had to finally watch this thing just so I could figure out how come I've had to listen to all this pill nonsense for the past 2 decades.  As you can see, it was not very high on my bucket list having put off this deed until now.  I personally thought it sucked, but then I could respect that other people might like it if it was their style.  E.g. possibly a good movie for catharsis if you sit at a computer all day wearing a suit, and dislike cops and your boss."
No Name,5,"The Matrix is a mind-blowing 5-star masterpiece! This sci-fi action film bends reality with incredible action, deep questions, and special effects that changed cinema. A must-watch!"
No Name,5,"At the end of the movie, you just say ‚Äúwow‚Äù, that is how amazing it is."
No Name,5,"Its a perfect movie, perfectly belnding realities, genres, classic music with rock and electronic music. Keanu is perfectly cast here (thank the cylon god, for Will Smith not understanding the script).
Its perfect. Simply."
No Name,5,One of my favorite movies ever.
No Name,5,"Very few movies have redefined the medium and shaken people's consciousness in such a profound way. None other has also become an international blockbuster phenomenon on top of that enduring through the ages as a true classic. Whatever anyone thinks of the follow-ups, this was a once in a lifetime achievement and we are all the richer thanks to it. Bravo!"
No Name,4,"Close to being a masterpiece, The Matrix defined a new concept of sci-fi movies with new special effects (especially the ""bullet time""). It has a good plot twist, an engaging story, and exciting action scenes. To me, it is one of the best movies out there."
No Name,4,"All time classic film, Keanu Reeves fills the role of Neo very well. Didn‚Äôt disappoint at all.  8/10"
No Name,5,The feeling of watching it in the cinema was indescribable. It is still among the best today.
No Name,5,What mind bending movie.  Great visuals and story.  Really enjoyed this film.
No Name,5,So much potential. This movie made me so excited about where the story could go. One of my all time favorite trips to the movie theater. I still remember that day in 1999 very well because of the impact this movie had on me.
No Name,4,"The original Matrix is an incredible movie with a very thought provoking story, about living in a simulation governed by robots, that also contains deep religious themes and symbolism."
No Name,5,Great action film.  Deserves a higher tomato score for sure.
No Name,5,"A film that revolutionized the sci-fi genre, just as ""Star Wars"" did before.... Still great to watch: extraordinary story, visually stunning. Still stimulates the imagination!"
No Name,4.5,What can I say that hasn‚Äôt already been said?
Timothy M,5,A classic. Even better again on the big screen!!
No Name,4,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
No Name,5,"It‚Äôs still great! That‚Äôs so impressive even after all these years. It has everything, even the action scenes still stand out compared to movies today. 

üëè ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
No Name,3.5,"Uses the 3 act structure very well, and is a great way to introduce a new epic world."
No Name,4,Um filme que revoluciono o estilo de fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica trazendo um lado nunca explorado no cinema sendo um dos melhores no g√™nero falhando apenas em alguns pontos onde fica confuso de entender por tratar de dois mundos distintos
No Name,5,"With one of the best stories I've ever seen in an action film, memorable characters, awesome visuals, and stunning action makes this one of the best films from the 90s"
No Name,5,"I thought this movie was great, it was interesting every second. The only issue I have is how addicting it is, so be warned, you will not be able to stop watching. Also, I get to spend time talking to my dad about it, because he loves it,  so we also get some father-son bonding time that I will cherish forever. :)"
No Name,5,"So good that you entirely forget the nutty premise that we're all being kept in suspended animation  wired into some kind of giant mainframe which creates more energy than it requires.
Oh well, whatever. Great adventure story."
No Name,4,"Event cinema in at it's best, it's often mocked, equally celebrated, for a reason."
No Name,4,"The Matrix is one of the most ambitious and captivating Sci-Fi films of all time. The action is electric, the characters are strong and there are legendary moments peppered throughout. Where the film is lacking is in the actual human aspect; the romance is underdeveloped and Neo's life in the Matrix is superficial (why do we need a scene of his boss disciplining him?).

That being said, the fight sequences are incredibly entertaining and the entire idea of the Matrix plays with your mind. I honestly fell asleep multiple times watching the film and had to go back and watch it again. From the slow motion to the muted colors, it was easy to doze off. However, once the climactic moments hit, I was enthralled. The helicopter scene is great and the final fight sequences hit hard.

I'm curious where the franchise will go from here, but this film is a brilliant start.

Best Character: Tank
Best Quote: ""There's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path."" - Morpheus
Best Scene: The Bullet Dodge
Best Piece of Score: ""He's the One Alright"""
No Name,5,Ha fatto la storia del cinema cyberpunk. Un cult intramontabile.
No Name,5,"Absolutely loved it.  Great concept, excellent execution.  Got more out of it the second time I watched it."
No Name,5,"One for the records, all-time fav!!"
No Name,5,Sick ass movie that I never get tired of. üòéüòéüòé
No Name,4.5,"Watched this in 2024, cant imagine how good it was when it first came out. Still a great movie. A bit too much figthing for my personal taste"
No Name,4.5,"A truly iconic sci-fi classic that takes on bold philosophical themes that have proven to be surprisingly timeless, and delivers all the ground-breaking visual thrills necessary to back them up, and then some."
No Name,5,Perfeito a hist√≥ria te prende at√© o final atua√ß√£o impec√°vel
No Name,4,"Shocking that the visuals and all the action sequences still hold up to this day. I was wowed on all the action sequences, and the fight choreography were also pretty awesome. I still remember watching this for the first time in December of 2021, and now almost 3 years later, I watch this again. And it's still holds up. The plot, premise, and all the action sequences helps make this movie interesting. I still can't get into the green hue that was used for the movie, but for the most part: it's still an amazing watch that somehow still blows my mind on how innovative they were in not only the visual and action department but storyline also!"
No Name,5,Highly intense special effects and completely insane action sequences are what make THE MATRIX a spectacular science fiction extravaganza that will immediately blow your mind.
No Name,3,It's aged well just not very exciting.
No Name,5,"Rewatched it today, more than 20 yrs. since last watch. 

Deserves 100% on RT

Cult classic üëå"
No Name,5,"Love this movie,  one of Keanu Reeves best franchises. Phenomenal special effects which  many action movies copy to this day. Mr. Smith ( Hugo Weaving) was an excellent antagonist. He was absolutely believable as the creepy federal agent out to destroy Neo.  One a weird factor, the movies made people really think out side of the box, a really rare thing these days. In short great acting , great story telling, great special effects all melded in one the last truly excellent films in the last era. If you haven't seen it, do so."
No Name,4.5,"Sci Fi at it's best. If you haven't watched it, don't let anyone spoil it for you."
casearmitage,5,"Twenty five years later, it still holds up. You have to see it to believe it."
No Name,5,"May very well be my all-time favorite film. Original, right?"
No Name,4,"The action scenes certainly don't hold up with age, but there are strong enough science fiction elements here, and a wonderful cast to bring it all together."
No Name,5,"The Matrix is, without a doubt, a groundbreaking visual feast that speaks volumes of humanity, control and the power of belief. It values human connection, individuality, the fight for freedom, and explores the importance of choice and free will, even if the reality we choose is a harsh one. Overall, it is a complete cinematic package. From the phenomenal fight choreography, and mind-bending visuals to Don Davis' powerful score, every element works together to create an unforgettable and exhilarating experience."
No Name,5,"This is a film without parallel.  A quarter century later, it still feels relevant and groundbreaking, in spite of how many times it has been attempted to be emulated."
No Name,5,I remember seeing this in the cinema the week it came out when I was ten years old and it's been my favorite science fiction movie I have ever seen. This movie is as awesome today as it was when it released back in 1999. I highly recommend this movie.
No Name,4.5,A movie which managed to stay in our hearts.
No Name,5,"The Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot an ordinary sci-fi movie. It's released in 1999, it's mind-blowing with story and special effects. Beyond cool fights, it asks: is our world real, or a simulated prison?

The key to The Matrix's success was combining action with big ideas.Neo, a computer hacker who feels like something is wrong with the world. His life takes a crazy turn when he meets Morpheus, a mysterious friend who reveals the shocking truth that the world Neo lives in is a fake reality called The Matrix. This confuses Neo and sets him on a mission to find out who he is and fight the system.

What this movie does very well is create a world that feels both normal and creepy at the same time. It will be a world with busy roads. The phone rings. and computer screen Even though it is something we encounter in everyday life. But there was a strange feeling. It's like something isn't right. It exploits our fears about technology and the blurred line between what is real and what is not. Are we really alive or are we just like characters in a simulated world that we don't even understand?

The film's special effects were amazing for their time, especially the famous ""bullet moment"" sequence where everything slows down. This isn't just a cool fight scene. They have a deeper meaning. They represent Neo's awakening. The moment he breaks free from the Matrix and begins to see things clearly.

But The Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmore than just a movie. It delves into some rather complicated concepts regarding philosophy and religion. Think about things like ideas about choices. This movie makes you think about free will. If our world isn't real Will there really be a choice for us? Is there a bigger purpose? Or are we just stuck in a simulated world?

The characters in this film are more than just fighters. Neo's journey from confused hacker to potential hero is thrilling to watch. Keanu Reeves plays the role of Neo perfectly. Showcasing her growing confusion and determination, Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus, the mysterious leader who believes in Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity. A skilled fighter who becomes Neo's friend,and Hugo Weaving is very creepy and cool as Agent Smith. Characters that represent the system that controls everything. The script of the film and the way these characters interact with each other is exciting and makes the film interesting and not boring.

The Matrix isn't perfect. Some sections may feel a little long-winded. And some people may think that Keanu Reeves doesn't show enough emotion. But these minor issues don't detract from the film's overall greatness. The Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa groundbreaking sci-fi film that perfectly blends action, big ideas, and stunning visuals.

It's a movie that will stay with you long after it's over. It's a movie that can be watched no matter how much time has passed. With a script that is filled with insights and philosophy, it invites you to question the world around you. Think about the choices you make. and consider the true meaning of freedom. What I love about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, it still holds up. You will learn more about this. It's a cinematic experience that reminds us that sometimes the most important truths are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be discovered. Whether you're a sci-fi action fan or just looking for a movie that will make you think differently, The Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsomething I recommend you watch at least once in your life.

5/5"
No Name,5,Doesn't get any better than this for me. A tight story with well choreographed action and practical affects. The special affects also hold up remarkably well. There are a few moments that drag but are also necessary for the narrative.
No Name,5,Perfect. It's my favorite film of all time.
No Name,5,the best movie of the history
No Name,5,Might be my favorite Scifi movie ever
No Name,5,"O que dizer, um cl√°ssico do cinema! Conceitos criados que funcionam at√© hoje, cenas que n√£o s√≥ s√£o memor√°veis, √©picas e muito bem dirigidas, como s√£o parte da cultura, talvez o √∫nico ponto negativo muito vis√≠vel para o filme √© a atua√ß√£o que beira o rid√≠culo do Keanu Reeves, quase te tirando do filme, mas n√£o tem como n√£o dar 10/10 para essa obra prima."
No Name,5,"A game-changing action film that took movie-goers by storm, cementing itself as one of the most influential science fictions films ever made. A modern, pop-culture icon!"
No Name,3.5,"The second half of the movie was awesome, but lowkey the first half was kinda boring and overly complicated."
No Name,5,Keanu is pretty cool. There is no spoon-the matrix
No Name,5,"GOOD MOVIE: ""The Matrix""(1999,(Rated=R))! [I went to, and saw,""The Matrix""(1999),at 2:30pm(CT) Sunday January 28, 2024[at GREAT movies places named:""Alamo Drafthouse Cinema""movies places];in Austin,Texas(TX).][I wrote my comments here at 11:59am(CT) Sunday January 29, 2024.]"
No Name,5,"This movie has aged so well it's worth rewatching. The ideas at the time of release were innovative, fresh and eye candy. Even today the sfx and storyline will captivate the modern audience. Finally, I love that this movie was shot in my childhood hometown Sydney."
No Name,5,The movie that refined cgi
No Name,5,"one of my favorite movies of all time, can rewatch it every now and then :)"
No Name,4.5,ew gross ew slimey ew
No Name,5,"""What is the Matrix?"" That was the question posed to us in the marketing for this movie that came out in 1999, one of the most stacked years for innovative storytelling in movies in decades. Who knew this movie would be as popular and influential as it has been. From groundbreaking special effects and action set pieces, to creating a whole philosophical movement (are we actually living in the Matrix?) to relaunching Keanu Reeves' career, this movie easily cemented itself into the conversation for being considered as one of the best films of all time. Or at least one of the most defining."
No Name,4.5,"perfect mix of science, action and just overall badass-ery"
No Name,4,"Una gran pel√≠cula de acci√≥n con escenas justificablemente rid√≠culas y con una historia muy interesante. Creo que lo √∫nico que no me gusto fue  la excusa de que neo es el elegido y que por eso revivi√≥, fue algo que hasta me hizo reir, fuera de eso la pel√≠cula es bastante buena"
No Name,4,"I love this film. The score is perfect. The only part I hate is how there is no explanation as to how Cypher got into the Matrix to meet with Agent Smith without anyone knowing. Other than that huge oversight, it's a great film."
No Name,5,"This was my favorite movie for a long, long time.  I was 30 when it came out and we had never seen anything like it before.  The cool rock music paired with slow-motion takes - so fresh!  And, of course the concept of reality - was mind-bending.  Sigh."
No Name,3.5,"Not what I was expecting at all. Got intrigued during the first maybe 30 minutes of the movie but felt kinda generic around the middle of the movie. It was only until around the end where you get those iconic matrix action scenes.

Overall, it's pretty good."
jojodamonk,5,"Pew pew üî´ü´∂üî• fun movie, Ws in the chat üí¨"
No Name,3.5,"great idea, still actual 24 years later. Worth viewing only this first episode."
No Name,5,The Best movie franchise ever.
No Name,4.5,Brilliant movie brilliant performances and brilliant action scenes
No Name,5,"As far as premises go, The Matrix has the best premise for a movie that I've ever seen."
No Name,5,Groundbreaking special effects at the time and the story itself took me entirely by surprise since had not read about it. Simply phenomenal!
No Name,5,One of the greatest movies of all time
No Name,4.5,"There's not a lot to be said here that people don't know :) 

You HAVE to watch this movie! It has one weird plot hole I hate (that's why it loses half a star), but otherwise, it is incredible! You can miss the sequels they are not great, but this is."
No Name,4,"Among the greatest and most inventive films ever produced. People will always wonder if we live in a matrix since it was made so brilliantly.
One of the best of 1999!"
No Name,4,A classic! As relevant as ever in 2023 with the emergence of artificial intelligence. Whether the machines take over our world remains to be seen!
No Name,3.5,"Unique slow motion bullet effects in air, although in ocean water depths, nobody knows how bullets interact in water if Keanu dived in the ocean like Superman - something the director should think about if reviving another sequel. The bad guy also good and he could be revived as another duplicate of himself in next sequel"
No Name,5,"Argueably the best film ever created. The Matrix is known for its ground breaking visual effects. It was intense and exciting and fun. The audience wanted more. Supremely well written and well acted.
It was a treat to see in the theater. Not once, but multiple times."
No Name,5,When a movie kinda changed your whole outlook on life
No Name,5,Definitely in my top 5 movies. I loved it so much that I drove two hours to Indianapolis to watch it in IMAX for the 20th anniversary.
No Name,4,"I excpected it to be better but it was still fantastic.
Tthe action and the style are both 10/10 and the characters were fantastic.
The use of sets instead of green screens was a choice that helped a lot the amazing style of the movie."
No Name,5,greatest sci fi of all time imho
No Name,4.5,One of the most innovative movies ever!
No Name,4.5,Great movie with a lot to say about society. The Hong Kong martial arts-style fighting sequences were especially of note.
No Name,5,That's my favourite movie!
No Name,3.5,"""The Matrix"" wasn't initially a film that piqued my interest, but once I gave it a chance, I was completely captivated. This iconic movie holds a special place in my heart, as it reminds me of my father's love for films like ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""The Hunger Games."" This connection enhanced my appreciation for the movie.

The action sequences and creativity displayed in ""The Matrix"" are truly exceptional and have left a lasting impact on the world of cinema. Keanu Reeves delivers a stellar performance, solidifying his status as a phenomenal actor.

The first film in the franchise stands out as the best, setting a high standard for any sequels or follow-ups. While the subsequent films may not have matched the brilliance of the original, the first installment remains a standout in its own right.

Overall, ""The Matrix"" is a movie that I highly recommend watching. Its blend of action, creativity, and stellar performances make it a cinematic gem that has stood the test of time."
No Name,0.5,Confusional and with lots of unnecessary action scenes.
No Name,4.5,One of the most creative and best movies ever made. It was made so well people will forever wonder if we are in a matrix.
No Name,5,Still one of the best action films ever made.
No Name,2.5,They should never have made the fourth movie - it ruined what the matrix was and had no real story line.
No Name,5,"This film was revolutionary in terms of filming technology, CGI and exploration of the theme of artificial intelligence! Perfect."
No Name,5,This movie is simply groundbreaking.
No Name,5,"Perhaps one of the most important and impactful movies of its time. Its plot unlocked minds. Its production changed the way we do movies forever. As a stand alone, it may have went down as a film without flaw, but the sequels did some damage to its perfection. Special attention to the transitions in this movie; they're stellar. Sadly, by the first sequel, the story became far too diluted, and the more recent reboot officially put the franchise is its tomb. Still, the original Matrix is s masterpiece, hands down‚Ä¶ but are these really my hands?"
No Name,5,This movie is just such an incredible film that brings joy every time I see it the movie just brings me back to when movies were actually good
No Name,5,This movie is a masterpiece!
No Name,5,this is a by far a classic
No Name,5,Excellent science fiction film perfectly tackles so many ideas.
No Name,4.5,A mind-bending sci-fi classic with groundbreaking visuals. Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne lead a gripping story of reality and illusion.
No Name,5,About as perfect of a movie as you can get. The concept. The visuals. The dialogue and yes even the acting. Poor Keanu fits perfectly in this role and actually makes this movie better than what it should‚Äôve been. Back with the brothers made good movies (before they became the sisters). We will never see another movie that changed the landscape of cinema or had a bigger cultural impact. It‚Äôs worth watching a few times.
No Name,5,"It was the most action packed homage to the ""Allegory of the Cave"" by Plato that I have ever seen"
No Name,5,"Really cool concept and idea. One of the most iconic and awesome sci-fi movies of all time. The story is one of the most interesting in cinema, and Keanu Reeves is awesome. It's a must see!"
No Name,5,"One of the most influential sci-films of all time, the rabbit hole story line never ceases to amaze. The tale of destiny is familiar but plausible when merged with mesmeric martial arts and incisive philosophical themes."
No Name,5,>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>scape the matrix
No Name,5,The Matrix is arguably one of the best sci-fi action films ever made.
No Name,4.5,muito bom! efeitos especiais surpreendentes para a √©poca!
No Name,3.5,"""Matrix"" (1999) plasma la relaci√≥n entre realidad e ilusi√≥n, plasmando la idea de la alegor√≠a de la caverna de Plat√≥n a la pantalla grande. Esta pel√≠cula nos presenta la reflexi√≥n filos√≥fica acerca de la percepci√≥n y cuestiona el l√≠mite entre el libre albedr√≠o y la determinaci√≥n que muestra el protagonista (Neo) durante su viaje. La naturaleza innovadora de la pel√≠cula contrasta con posibles complejidades narrativas.Obteniendo cuatro estrellas, es una historia que navega las profundidades de la identidad, la elecci√≥n y el enigma de la existencia, invitando a cuestionar la trama de la misma. Su impacto duradero resuena como una b√∫squeda de la verdad en un mundo que se caracteriza por tener cientos de puntos de vista..."
No Name,5,One of the best science fiction Movies! Keanu Reeves did a very well Job!
No Name,4.5,Amazing visuals and story
No Name,5,I saw this when I was like 9 and did not really like it but I just watched it and it is amazing it is in my top 10 movies ever and it is a must see for anyone who likes sci-if or action
No Name,1.5,"The Matrix has a provoking concept that is well used in the first part of the film. However, the standard action at the end feels stale and disrespectful after such a moving beginning."
No Name,4.5,An excellent sc fi action film
No Name,3.5,Neo vs Morphius Katare scene is excellent
No Name,5,"Incredible, mind bending, scintillating movie that will leave you thinking twice about your own existence. 2 incredible villains, awesome fight scenes, great special effects, amazing plot line. What more could you ask for? I definitely recommend it."
No Name,5,Amazing movie definitely number one sci-fi classic  of  all time.  great story ground breaking action and one of the best movie concepts in the world.
No Name,5,The original Matrix movie is the absolute best movie I've seen. And very ineresting as well.
No Name,4.5,"""The Matrix"" is a revolutionary cyberpunk classic that fuses mind-bending philosophy with groundbreaking visuals. Keanu Reeves's Neo leads a captivating narrative that challenges reality and delivers adrenaline-pumping action. The film's iconic 'bullet time' effects and martial arts choreography remain awe-inspiring. With enduring influence, ""The Matrix"" explores existential questions while setting new standards for science fiction cinema. An essential watch that continues to captivate and provoke discussion."
No Name,5,The greatest 02 hours: and 16 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Name,4.5,"Did you know there's a significant increase of the soundtrack usage of White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane after Matrix came out? So come, take the red pill Mr. Anderson & ignore that kid with the spoon"
No Name,5,"A near perfect movie. One of my (and probably every sci-fi/martial arts/action fan) most watched and beloved movies. 
Every now and then, comes a movie that defines, improves, inspires and therefore changes the whole industry it belongs to. Nothing was ever the same for a generation of filmmakers, writers or movie lovers after they first set eyes on The Matrix.
It's crazy how to this day, you can tell if a movie was made pre or post matrix. Even crazier, is how the philosophies and ideas present in The Matrix got so many things right about society, technology and modern day life in general. A must see for any movie lover."
No Name,5,"The matrix was an absolutely phenomenal movie. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Truly had you at the edge of your seat the whole time and was extremely interesting, turned my mind into different levels of thought I'd never achieved. This is truly a work of art everyone must see before they die."
No Name,5,"The Matrix revolutionizes sci-fi action with its groundbreaking visuals, mind-bending concept, and Keanu Reeves' iconic portrayal of Neo, becoming a cult classic and a sci-fi masterpiece."
No Name,5,"A movie which managed to stay in our hearts, but mostly in our pondering minds years after we initially saw it."
No Name,4.5,"The best sci-fi movie of the late 90s. Very existential. The fight choreographies, set design and themes explored make this an action packed film that will keep you thinking about it way after you've left the theatre. Yes, I did see it in a theatre."
No Name,3.5,"Very fresh ideas and well executed. However, regarding to the editing, the scenes are sometimes cut too early and the music fade too fast."
No Name,5,Imagine how different the movie would be if Neo had achromatopsia...
No Name,5,Fresh visuals and ideas that changed movies forever. Shocked it didn't get a higher rating among audiences.
No Name,4.5,"'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.

It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.

Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.

Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.

Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.

Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.

Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park."
No Name,5,This movie was a legend of cinema history
No Name,5,"die Kameraf√ºhrung mit den ganzen Tricks die man von der Zeit davor noch nicht kannte waren klasse ,Die Story war super ,sie hat wirklich Leute nach dem Kino dazu gebracht um nachzudenken ob wir wirklich in einer Matrix leben ,Einfach Klasse der Film ,SPOILER: alles war gut nur am Ende war es ein wenig hier im M√§rchen das er durch einen Kuss wieder zum leben erweckt dennoch 1A derFilm"
No Name,5,"excellent, stunning, amazing - MY ALL TIME FAVORITE !!!"
No Name,4,"Sempre tive curiosidade em ver esse filme e quando assisti fiquei um pouco surpreso de no ser bem o que eu esperava, o filme em geral  muito bom e um destaque pras cenas de ao que eu adorei, a histria do filme  bem confusa e talvez por isso fui perdendo interesse durante o filme, mas o final acaba salvando, gostei do filme

Nota 79100"
No Name,4.5,"Thinking back to the time this movie came out, I imagine how innovative this sci-fi story had to be also within its action. The philosophical side about what is reality and the behavior of society before it hand in hand with a future where there are more questions than answers. Eager to continue seeing the development of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, in the same way, Agent Smith, a villain with a lot of potential."
No Name,5,"Impeccably intelligent as it is entertaining, The Matrix embodies the Wachowskis' thoughtfulness and visual flair in filmmaking, many of these standards still unmatched today."
No Name,2.5,"This will upset the fanboys but this is the most overrated movie of 1999.
The use of CGI is excellent, but that doesn't make up for a bloated, convoluted screenplay."
No Name,5,"Ground breaking and facinating. Characters are facinating, world setting is outstanding and story is fantastic. Special effects are seamless and the atmosphere is amazing. An iconic movie that I expect to be a classic."
No Name,5,One of the most innovative films in the sci fi genre. It has a very original concept and a very distinct color palette. Definitely a classic.
No Name,4.5,really great movie keanu is so good
No Name,5,One of the best science fiction movies of the decade. Original storyline with top notch on your feet action that has aged well over the years. Remarkable
No Name,5,"Groundbreaking at the time and still holds up to this day.
I saw it at the cinema 3 times back in the day and it blew my mind every time.
I NEVER get bored of this film - just staggering."
No Name,5,"Will always be the best film I have ever watched! Nothing will come close, apart from the 2nd one...."
No Name,5,"This movie is simply incredible, noting that it was before the 2000s. It has fantastic visual effects, not to mention the auditory ones, which are wonderful. It has very good dialogues, plot, suspense and science fiction. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT 1 TIME IN THEIR LIFE!"
No Name,5,This movie was a revolution (pun intended)! It changed the way action movies are filmed. A must see.
No Name,5,"One of the most influential science fiction films of all time, and a marvellous (though nebulous) critique of capitalism and societal control of individual expression and personal identity."
No Name,5,"A movie that changed cinema forever, pioneering film, casting, acting, effects, story, pretty much everything was spot on."
No Name,5,One of my all time favorite flims ground breaking cinematography a massive cultural touch stone that shaped every piece action and scientific media to come after it i cant recommend this flim enough to anyone who likes action and or sci fi this is all without mentioning its amazing depiction of the brain in a jar theory
No Name,5,"Great franchise, love this movie the best!"
No Name,5,Incr√≠vel e futurista.
No Name,5,"Um dos filmes mais criativos e tamb√©m um dos melhores que j√° vi. O filme tem um car√°ter filos√≥fico gigantesco, ele te faz refletir o tempo todo. Keanu Reeves √© um grande ator e aqui est√° melhor do que nunca fazendo Neo, o escolhido. O filme se passa num futuro onde o mundo √© dominado pelas m√°quinas mas ningu√©m sabe disso, pois elas criaram um mundo virtual, onde as pessoas vivem normalmente e n√£o suspeitam de nada, a Matrix. Neo ..."
No Name,5,"Excellent movie, with thousands of analogies and very deep philosophically, not seeing it as the action movie that it is, has much more to it"
No Name,4.5,A little hokey from time to time but otherwise wonderful.
No Name,5,An all-time classic.  So many elements of the original Matrix have been endlessly ripped off and referenced that it's easy to forget how groundbreaking it was at the time.
No Name,5,A classic. Not even a debate!
No Name,5,"La base de los efectos y el mejor avance tecnol√≥gico de la √©poca a mi parecer. Excelente, con excelente fotograf√≠a, efectos y una trama en extrema interesante"
No Name,5,"Um filme sensacional para todas as idades, explicando detalhadamente cada detalhe, cenas muito sensacionais e bem escritas, o amor de Trinity por Neo √© muito detalhado nesse trazendo um romance muito memor√°vel..."
No Name,3,"I wanted to watch this because I wanted to understand the references (red pill versus blue pill). I came away being slightly disappointed. The world idea is incredibly interesting, but I just couldn't get over how much time was dedicated to expositioning and telling our main character Neo that he is the chosen one. I am not a fan of ""The Chosen One"" arcs in movies and books because they are incredibly unrealistic and put an incredible amount of pressure on the protagonist. And then there was the cliche of love bringing you back from the dead which I disliked. Also, I understand this is supposed to be a action movie, but there were too many guns. Finally, for how much time the movie dedicated explaining why the Matrix is bad, I still don't understand why it is bad. People are living perfectly fine lives in The Matrix."
No Name,5,"I love this film, it is a classic."
No Name,5,Um dos melhores filmes que j√° assisti at√© hoje.
No Name,5,"A ground breaking movie (which owes a nod to Dark City imho) with astonishing direction, special effects, score, script and acting. The cast are uniformally excellent but special mention must go to Fishbourne, Moss and Reeves who are magnificent. There's literally nothing I'd change about this film, it's practically perfect in both concept and execution."
No Name,5,"Obviamente una joyita del cine, el que la vea y no la entienda, se le recomienda verla 3 veces y seguir con las dem√°s ‚ú®üôå"
No Name,5,"Una obra maestra, que por desgracia los hermanos Wachowski quisieron darle continuaci√≥n."
No Name,5,"Innovative for the time, a totally different concept than usual, a journey that keeps you hooked throughout the entire film, with both futuristic and contemporary notes for the date of its release and publication. It is worth seeing more than once."
No Name,5,Red√©couvert plusieurs ann√©es apr√®s mon premier visionnage et cette fois en UHD Dolby Vision et on y replonge avec enthousiasme. Certains passages continuent de faire √©cho avec notre soci√©t√© actuelle (et finalement avec l'IA on se rapproche doucement de la vision propos√© par ce film culte). Matrix reste un classique pour les amateurs de Sci-Fi.
No Name,5,"More than 20 years after premiere and still so significant. Like any spectacular sci-fi, it talks about the human spirit."
No Name,5,An iconic movie and super creative too.
No Name,5,Exelente para assistir...
No Name,0.5,"25 years later, I still don't get it."
No Name,5,A cinematic masterpiece
No Name,4.5,Ground breaking.  It's a movie that you can't wait to show the next generation.
No Name,5,"It's a great sci-fi movie, integrates philosofy and technology in a wonderful way"
No Name,5,"One of the greatest movies ever, and its metaphor is still so relevant!"
No Name,5,A masterpiece. Brilliant.
No Name,5,One of the best films ever. I can watch it again and again and discover new things and ask new questions.
No Name,5,"Perfect

10 out of 10."
No Name,5,esta pelicula marco una era !!
No Name,5,This movie is such a classic I love it so much
No Name,5,"Filme sensacional, com excelente roteiro, grandes atua√ß√µes, excelente colora√ß√£o, uma verdadeira obra prima."
No Name,5,The greatest 02 hours: and 16 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Name,5,Um cl√°ssico atemporal
No Name,3.5,"La pel√≠cula tiene un argumento debatible en cuanto al porqu√© las m√°quinas requieren usar al ser humano, sin embargo es perdonable pues el tipo de pel√≠cula es de acci√≥n y cumple si objetivo.
Muy buenos efectos especiales para su √©poca, entretenida y deja el deseo de saber algo m√°s sobre este mundo post apocal√≠ptico."
No Name,5,Totalmente inesperado. Fui surpreendido pelo forma que brinca com a realidade.
No Name,4.5,"The movie takes, not only Neo, but us as well, into the rabbit's hole. It manage to entertain, blow our minds, make us reflect, as individuals and as a society. Is an experience, and the type of movie we need back into today's cinema."
No Name,5,Need more movies like this one
No Name,5,Enjoyed thios movie from the beginning till the end. Good reflexion about life and society.
No Name,5,"Mi favorita de toda la franquicia, creadora de un universo √∫nico y eterno"
No Name,5,"Keanu Reeves, in his role as the enigmatic Neo, delivers an unforgettable performance that solidifies his status as one of Hollywood's most versatile actors. Reeves brings an incredible depth to Neo, effortlessly transitioning from a bewildered office worker to a fearless warrior, all while maintaining a relatable vulnerability. His portrayal of Neo's journey from skepticism to self-discovery is nothing short of breathtaking. Reeves' presence on-screen is magnetic, capturing the audience's attention from the very first frame and keeping them engaged throughout the film.

However, it is not only Reeves' acting prowess that makes ""The Matrix"" a groundbreaking experience. The film's storyline is a true marvel of innovation and creativity. The concept of a simulated reality controlled by machines, while humans remain oblivious, was an entirely fresh idea at the time. ""The Matrix"" seamlessly blends philosophy, action, and intrigue, weaving together a complex narrative that challenges the boundaries of our perception. The film presents philosophical questions about the nature of reality and free will, leaving audiences contemplating their own existence long after the credits roll.

The Wachowski siblings deserve immense praise for their visionary approach to storytelling. Their bold and imaginative direction brings the film's groundbreaking ideas to life, creating a visually striking world that remains visually stunning even years after its release. The use of slow-motion action sequences and groundbreaking special effects revolutionized the way action movies were made, influencing countless films that followed in its wake.

""The Matrix"" is a triumph of both cinematic artistry and intellectual stimulation. It combines Keanu Reeves' outstanding performance with an innovative and thought-provoking story, resulting in an unforgettable viewing experience. Its impact on popular culture and cinema cannot be overstated, and it remains a testament to the power of daring storytelling and exceptional acting. If you haven't seen ""The Matrix,"" prepare to be transported to a world where reality is not what it seems, and be prepared to question everything you know."
No Name,2.5,I'm going to be honest‚Ä¶The Matrix doesn't do it for me. It's a little odd at times almost like the story isn't thought through enough and kind of fast pace for me. It had the same problem the original Star Wars had but at least they made up for it masterfully. I just can't say the same for this one.
No Name,5,"The Matrix is arguably one of the best sci-fi movies ever, it stays interesting for its entire duration and the plot is amazing.
Truly a must-watch."
No Name,4.5,"A classic. Still confused as to how it got the R rating, though."
No Name,4.5,"SPOILERS This film follows Neo, a software developer by day, underground computer hacker by night. A man named Morpheus shows Neo the reality of his world, that him and everyone else are living out their lives in a fake simulation developed by the robots that now inhabit earth. It is prophesized that Neo is the chosen one, and will be the hope the human race needs to free themselves from the clutches of machines. 

I had high expectations before watching this movie - everyone knows The Matrix, and that it's influence and references transcend cinema. I can happily say It was better than I expected! What a world to get immersed in for two hours. I loved the dystopian future setting, and found it very reminiscent of Blade Runner with the low key lighting, constant rain, and accompanying foreboding presence. It stood on its own two feet however with the present day earth production design and the plot of machines now controlling earth. I found it breathtaking watching the scenes and flashbacks that took place on earth, the black clouds with no sun, billions of humans encapsulated in endless spires, robots scouring the land. Morpheus' ship looked incredibly 90s sci-fi, but it was great, and watching it travers the sewers was sweet. All in all the production design, costumes, sets and cgi in this movie are incredible. The look and feel is 10/10.

Now onto the story. I loved the plot, humans trapped by robots in a simulation to keep them content while the robots suck their energy. A group of rebel fighters free the chosen one from his mundane fake life and train him, showing him the mind bending reality. As a viewer you feel right there with neo, because well, a lot of us live the lives Neo did. All of a sudden hes being told it is all fake and we watch him struggle to process it - as a viewer I was truly side-by-side with Neo and was trying to wrap my head around it too. The logic behind the matrix and the rules we learn through Morpheus and the crew are all believable given the context, not to mention so incredibly cool. Neo being the ""chosen one"" can be cliche, but in this movie I accepted it and didn't mind. Up until the final 30 minutes I was convinced that they had the wrong guy. The payoff at the end when Neo finally kills and agent is one of those rare moments where emotion, action and understanding come together in a perfect climax. Let me also mention how well done the action is. great shootouts with acrobatic stunts, high stakes and uniqueness - so crazy this was back in 99. 

This movie has undertones of some deep and thought-provoking themes. Free will vs fate, existentialism, being controlled by a tyranical force, oppression, etc. 

I was a fan of the love that blossoms between Neo and Trinity, but I have to say it did come a bit abruptly at the end. We get hints the entire movie that trinity feels something for him, but Neo gives us next to nothing. A few more moments between them would have really cemented their feelings. Another big thing I feel like is never explained is why the robots created the Matrix in the first place. If they created it to keep humans sedated and satisfied so that they inevitably turn to energy - why not just trap them in the pods minus the Matrix? Why go through the trouble of giving a race you went to war with a whole fake universe? Just grow and harvest us like you've been doing and keep us trapped or sedated. Idk that question was plaguing me the whole movie. Another thing is the use of guns for all the action. If the Matrix is a computer simulation, and these Agents and Neo can see it for what it is and exploit it, I would have liked some crazy action beyond guns. There was so much more potential for mind bending fights - I mean these people can literally make this simulation their playground. Its also worth a note that Keanu is the best worst actor ever. He was better here than in John Wick, but I didn't find much impressive in terms of his acting. 

Overall, The Matrix is an expansive sci-fi movie with incredible action sequences, beautiful sets, world design and a mind bending story that stays grounded. I loved this film from start to finish."
No Name,5,Go watch this. Why haven't u seen it
No Name,4,It's A Good Movie But It Can Get Really Confusing At Some Points
No Name,4.5,One of my favorites. It's a fun movie.
No Name,5,It's very impressing. A classic movie that must need to watch.
No Name,4.5,This movie is truly one of the greats it has stood the test of time in more ways than one. It added so many new features and story building to cinema as a whole. The iconic neo played by Keanue Reeves is one of the best rolls I've seen. Overall great movie with quotable limes and memriable scenes.
No Name,5,"The Matrix is a virtually dazzling cyber adventure movie. I love since 2006 when I watched it.

No Name,4.5,"Good movie, recommend"
No Name,4.5,Can be a best movie of the way of the world works and how blow your mind for just the first second
No Name,4.5,The near perfect beginning of an amazing future Earth.  This is an imaginative and groundbreaking film meant to outlast us all.
No Name,5,"People think of The Matrix as the first modern sci-fi movie. If you like science fiction movies, you
should put this one at the top of your list. A movie has a lot of action and a complex matrix
universe that many people don&#39;t fully understand. The film that Lana and Andy Wachowski
produced entered IMDb&#39;s top 20 with an 8.7 rating. Keanu Reeves&#39; character Neo is the subject of
this movie.
People depend on ChatGPT a lot these days. OpenAI made ChatGPT, a chatbot with artificial
intelligence. This movie shows what might happen if artificial intelligence takes over and runs the
world instead of people.
In the year 2199, robots run this planet. You might want to know how a robot came to be in charge
of this planet. To find out, you only need to go back a few decades, when people invented super-
artificial intelligence. But what&#39;s interesting about this new AI is that it can feel like a person, which
means that even robots have feelings. Robots are used in every part of everyday life. People
came to depend on robots in every way. But people used the robot as if it were a toy. But when a
robot doesn&#39;t do enough for its owner, the owner just throws it away without feeling bad about it.
So, they began to feel like they were being pushed around. They didn&#39;t know what the robots were
up to. Robots built their own country, and because they don&#39;t sleep and don&#39;t get stressed out like
humans, their economy is growing very quickly every day. The robots&#39; economies are better than
humans, and this worries them a lot. They were planning something very, very strange!
As I already said, robots don&#39;t sleep or get stressed out, but to stay active, they need to charge
themselves. Sunlight is the only thing that gives them energy, and people were planning
something that had to do with sunlight. People&#39;s most strange idea was when they finally figured
out how to make &quot;Dark Strom,&quot; which makes dark clouds in the sky and blocks the sun. Because
of this, robots couldn&#39;t get enough sunlight to power up. The lack of sunlight was also bad for
people, so this experiment didn&#39;t work out well for them either. Greenland became a desert
because the trees were dying. Humans were at war with robots, so robots started to think about
how to solve this problem, which they did.
People couldn&#39;t win the war because robots came up with the idea that &quot;when a human brain
activates for a function, it makes bio-electricity.&quot; Robots were abducting people to make
bioelectricity. People no longer have to have sex to have children. In movies, we can see many
bodies that have been kept alive in cisterns. But no matter how many times the robot updates it,
the matrix always has a glitch or bug. Neo is also called &quot;The One&quot; in the movie. Glitch can&#39;t affect
Neo in any way, which is why he&#39;s a threat to the matrix. The movie shows how Neo started the
war against machines to save humanity. Not a single spoiler! Enjoy the film!"
No Name,5,"The Matrix is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and influential movies of all time, and there are many reasons why it is regarded as a great film. From its innovative visual effects to its thought-provoking philosophical themes, The Matrix has become a classic that continues to captivate audiences more than two decades after its release.

One of the key strengths of The Matrix is its groundbreaking use of special effects. The film's ""bullet time"" effect, which slows down the action to a fraction of its normal speed, has become an iconic visual motif that has been emulated countless times in movies and other forms of media. This effect, along with the film's other impressive visual effects, helped to create a truly immersive and unforgettable cinematic experience.

But The Matrix is more than just a technical achievement. At its core, the movie is a philosophical exploration of reality and what it means to be human. The film's central premise, that humanity is trapped in a simulated reality created by machines, raises profound questions about the nature of reality and the limits of human knowledge. The Matrix challenges viewers to question their own perceptions of the world around them and to consider the possibility that there may be more to reality than meets the eye.

The film also features memorable characters and performances that have become iconic in their own right. Keanu Reeves delivers a compelling performance as Neo, the film's protagonist, while Laurence Fishburne's portrayal of Morpheus is both charismatic and wise. The villainous Agent Smith, played by Hugo Weaving, is a menacing and unforgettable antagonist who embodies the oppressive nature of the Matrix itself.

Ultimately, The Matrix is a great movie because it manages to be both intellectually stimulating and visually stunning. It combines cutting-edge special effects with a thought-provoking exploration of reality and humanity, creating a cinematic experience that is both entertaining and meaningful. It's a film that has stood the test of time and continues to inspire new generations of moviegoers."
No Name,4,"An absolute classic entry in the science fiction genre. I think that it survives time pretty well, although there are aspects that have lost momentum over the years. Overall, it is a very enjoyable watch and definitely should be enjoyed as a true popcorn movie."
No Name,5,"Once viewers are able to overcome the fact that these special effects did not stand the test of time, they're still left with a film that is action-packed and encased in a philosophically rich story that revolutionized American cinema. Full of a perfect roster of actors (Reeves, Fishburne, Moss, and more), The Matrix tells the story of the future (or the present?) in which all of humanity has been overtaken by machines in the real world and are plugged into The Matrix wherein they live their lives knowing nothing of true reality. The simulation called life that we all experience could all be within a computer simulation dictated by mechanical overlords who are, in reality, harvesting us for our collective heat and energy. There exist small factions of individuals who have broken free from The Matrix and have seen the desolate reality in which the world actually exists and they work to help free humanity by working within (and sometimes outside of) the system to which we've all been enslaved. When one of these resistance factions, led by Morpheous (Laurence Fishburne), gets word of a computer hacker (Keanu Reeves) living within the confines of the program who fits a prophecy regarding the absolution of mankind, they work quickly to try and free him from The Matrix so that he might lead humanity to freedom. It's the sort of plot that might seem contrived now that there have been so many imitators, but for the turn of the century it was as absorbing as it was fascinating. There is plenty to love here, despite the one-time revolutionary special effects seeming quite dated. If you find yourself a purveyor of turn-of-the-century action movies you owe it to the original standout that made sci-fi action stylish without sacrificing compelling storytelling."
No Name,5,"The Matrix blew my mind when it first came out in the theaters, would have given the rating 10+ if I could!"
No Name,4,Red pill or blue pill?
No Name,5,"On of a kind. Words cannot describe how good that film is. It's magnificent, fabulous, just perfect!"
No Name,5,One of the best sci-fi movies ever!
No Name,4,"Now, with John Wick Chapter 4 releasing, I thought it would be a great time to revisit another one of Keanu Reeve's most well-known roles. Neo in The Matrix. This movie is still so good after all this time. The action is so fast paced and along with some great editing make for some insanely creative action set pieces. The visual effects are amazing, at least for their time. The story is also pretty gripping and the villains are so much fun to watch, but it's not perfect, that's for sure. This movie really overstays it's welcome, so that when a cool scene comes at the end, I have completely fallen out of the story and just end up bored. The drama is also just not that interesting. I don't care for any of the other characters except for Neo, trinity and Morpheus and even the drama between Neo and Trinity is so uninteresting. A lot of good, a share of bad stuff and some truly amazing movie moments."
No Name,5,"Matrix es una pel√≠cula que llevo el cine de acci√≥n y ciencia ficci√≥n a un nuevo nivel con su visi√≥n Cyberpunk, buenas escenas de acci√≥n, efectos especiales y una profunda filosof√≠a sobre la relaci√≥n entre el sistema y la sociedad. El duo Wachowski supo crear una excelente pel√≠cula que fue un gran salto para el elenco compuesto por Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss y Hugo Weaving. La banda sonora de Don Davis tampoco se queda a√∫n lado o la coreograf√≠a del artista marcial Yuen Woo Ping. Esta pel√≠cula fue un nuevo avance para el cine y por eso es sin duda una de las mejores pel√≠culas de la historia del cine. Mi calificaci√≥n para esta pel√≠cula es un 10/10."
No Name,5,"I so love that movie, it's great!"
No Name,4,"The plot is very good and gets you invested in the main characters while building out the world of the movie. The plot had many twists and turns, but they never felt cheap. Action sequences are solid as well. Agent Smith was a great villain."
No Name,5,"Everyone knows this movie. It was a phenomena at it's time. I wish, I could watch it again without know anything about the plot."
No Name,5,Great movie worth a rewatch.
No Name,5,"The science fiction hall of fame would have to include this film.  And entire new genre within sci fi, i.e., we're living in a false reality controlled by artificial intelligence.  So well done that not many even vaguely approach this artistry.

In 2010 I saw this but had no understanding of what it was really about. So gave it 3 stars. Fast forward 13 yrs later and my perspective has clearly changed."
No Name,5,"For Roughly the next ten years after this came out pretty much every action scene in every movie tried to imitate this in some shape or form animated, small screen, big screen, and even commercials. It's very clear why, many have imitated it and none really have ever come close to making the elements here work so well in this All Time Classic. The acting in this is phenomenal. Yes it has that classic 00's emotionless style of acting for a lot of character and arguably this is the film that popularized that style, but it works here mainly because of how surreal the plot is and it fits the characters. Neo is awesome to watch become a total badass, Smith is one of the best villains I've seen, and Morpheus is a great supporting character. Trinity is very good but her emotionless style sometimes misses like in the end when she confesses her love and despite small signs throughout it would've been better to actually see it more. Though she is a badass also. the cinematography and special effects all hold up incredibly well and are some of the best from this era and look incredible still and fit the ascetics of the world. The pacing and editing are excellent as well which is no small task handling the expose and never making it feel overloaded. The music is really good also. Everyone should give this a try. Is it overrated? To an extent maybe but on its own merits its a excellent Sci-Fi/Action film."
No Name,5,Perfect. My favourite movie ever.
No Name,4,"Unfortunately, the effects have not aged perfectly, and the plot is also very much written according to the pattern, but you should still see it at least once."
No Name,5,Plato would be proud.
No Name,5,"First film I'd ever seen on DVD, a film before it's time, if seen upon release you'd have been in awe of it's special effects and thought prevoming.themse and narrative. Speaking from all viewers of our erra who saw this back in the day, there was none better. Still my favorite among the series, though I enjoy them all (full awareness of faults). A++++ --5 stars all the way for the origins of the bullet time shot."
No Name,4,Carrie-Anne Moss is so good in this movie it can't be under-appreciated.  The sequels are kinda weird/goofy but this one is the real deal.
No Name,4.5,"Unique and thought provoking, one of the most talked about movies even today which shows it's impact"
No Name,5,One and only. Wachowski messed up by doing everything after that.
No Name,5,This is for sure keanu reeves most famos roles and it still holds up well but it feels like a pg-13 movie even if it is R (the sequals are R for a reason but not this one) and it uses great effects
No Name,5,"This is the movie that changed everything in modern filmmaking. Aesthetics, action sequences, VFXs, plot. A must see."
No Name,2.5,I will give credit that this movie really did impact the world of cinema. But that doesn't change the fact that i still can't get into this movie.
Andre G,5,I love this whole series besides the newest one. I honestly always thought everything in the world was fake. So when this came out it was exactly what I've been thinking my whole life up to that point. Humans against the machines. I was surprised how spot on the movie was to my thoughts.
No Name,3.5,"I mean‚Ä¶ it was a good movie, just not for me. The story was meh, idea was great, execution was meh, acting was good, cringe level was extraordinary, action was epic, and the villain was pretty good. I didn‚Äôt like some factors of the story itself but I see why it got good reviews if that makes any sense. I would suggest watching it because action sequences were amazing."
No Name,5,"One of the most famous and memorable movies in cinematic history. The Matrix has evolved into a Cultural Masterpiece of pop culture that i'm sure everybody has at least seen parts of it. the most memorable moment, The Bullet Time Sequence, is among the most famous movie sequences ever put on the silver screen. It has been referenced countless times in other movies and media and has since become a cultural Phenomenon of epic proportions. 11/10 movie. Absolute Must See."
Brian J,5,"A masterpiece, both as a philosophy thriller and a terrific action film."
No Name,3.5,Crazy new idea and really cool effects
No Name,5,The best sound mixing ever done in a movie! With the best visual effects ever done in a movie!
No Name,5,"Full of twists and below-the-surface meanings that all intricately wind together, as well as superb action sequences, ""The Matrix"" was a film far beyond its time."
No Name,4.5,"A classic turn-of-the-millennia 80s-costume cinematic action throwback with impeccable Yuen Woo-ping kung-fu mashed up with a John Woo-style cement-busting shooter in a sci-fi backdrop. This film has everything from suspense to social commentary to tapping our natural fears that AI will throw its Asian slipper at us. On top of a script that starts from a relatable routine-driven protagonist and Keanu's now world-loved wooden acting (+adding another ""Whoa"" to the supercut), they actually invented the bullet-time filming technique during production. It's a movie that, if you ignore its sequels and pretend it's a stand-alone, it benches the test of eternity. It's a repeat-viewer, which is pretty much most filmmaker's goals if they're not Hallmark-hires. So, take your red pills and swallow this motion picture masterpiece."
No Name,5,This is a superb movie.

AND THE FACT THAT PINHEAD AGED UP 40 YEARS AND IS NOW OLDER THAN THE AGELESS GOD LYLE WAS DOWN RIGHT SACRILEGIOUS!!!"
No Name,5,"Amazing Movie, still is and Allways good to watch."

No Name,4,Um filme vision√°rio que envelheceu muito bem
No Name,5,"Groundbreaking, original and a thought-provoking huge scale Science Fiction film with plenty of action and a great screenplay as a base. This is by far the best of the trilogy and really establishes it's characters and their backgrounds as well as the storyline for things to come, yet there is also constant action and thrilling choreography on display the whole running time. The Matrix is easily one of the best science fiction films of the past two decades and remains so!"
No Name,5,Thanks to the Wachowskis' creative vision. The Matrix is one of the greatest films that show us how far technology has come and what we can achieve.
No Name,5,20 plus years later and it's still good.
No Name,5,"Great special Effects.
Great Action Scenes.
Great Characters."
No Name,4.5,"filme muito foda, o roteiro √© foda, o elenco √© muito bom, as cenas de a√ß√£o s√£o excelentes, o come√ßo do filme √© excelente, com a trinity dando o chute na cara do policial com a camera em diversos angulos, o filme tem muitas cenas boas como a cena do inicio, a cena da pilula vermelha ou azul que neo tem que escolher um das duas pilulas, gostei da cena da luta entre o neo vs morfeo em luta de de kung-fu, achei muito bom a cena do tiroteio contras alguns policiais e militares, e depois disso, veio a cena classica do filme, o neo desviando das balas, de um dos agentes dos smith, ficou muito boa cena do helicoptero, achei legal tamb√©m
a luta entre o agente smith vs o neo, tem outra cena foda quando neo para as balas com a m√£o, provando ser o escolhido, esse filme eu recomendo muito, vale muito a pena assistir cada minuto, 
cada segundo, um dos melhores filmes da d√©cada."
No Name,5,Masterpiece. What a treat of a film.
No Name,5,What a rollercoaster of a spectacle. A eye opener to what could be the future or the now.
No Name,5,"Masterpiece involving philosophy, outstanding special effects - it's a groundbreaking film that sets the standards for science fictions"
No Name,4,"This movie is thrilling and confusing, some scenes have you thinking what just happened while others really make you fall deep in thought."
No Name,4,"When I first saw this, I did not know what the big deal was. On second viewing, trying to see it through someone's eyes who might've seen in it 1999, you have to appreciate it for its ingenuity, original style, etc. Check it out if you have not and watch it in that way and be appreciative!"
No Name,3.5,"I gave the movie four stars for of the flashy special effects. Otherwise it was a passable science fiction movie. The entire premise of the film reads like a modern, Hollywood science fiction update of ancient Buddhist or Hindu philosophy. Of course we all live in a matrix--we live in two of them: a complex of lies created by people in power to keep us from realizing our full potential, as well as a fiction created for us as souls on a physical planet. Anyone who's read the book, ""Autobiography of a Yogi"" will fathom that much. The world of the red pill certainly doesn't look appealing; I can't imagine most people taking it. The blue pill will always be the selection of the majority because the concept of ""freedom"" has always been grossly exaggerated. No human being is ever utterly free--regardless of the circumstances. After reading the synopsis of the garbled screenplay of the second film, I certainly wouldn't spend the money to rent it."
No Name,5,My personal favourite movie of all time immaculate modern day art nothing will ever top this
No Name,5,The Best thing ever.
No Name,5,"This movie changed my life in 1999 when i watched it in theatres when it opened. I will never forget how my childhood self felt walking out of that theatre, nothing ever looked the same again."
No Name,4.5,"I absolutely love this movie, top 10 of all time for me. The groundbreaking visuals, the characters and world building all tied together with the subtle but noticible music playing underneath. The plot is great and interesting from everything form the ai and matrix down to the training simulations. This movie is, quite simply put, a masterpiece of film. The fight scenes are all really cool and extremely well choreographed and all the props and sets look amazing, from the ship to the subway. It has a genuinely awesome villain whom gets good development over the course of the film and all the actors has really good chemistry together. Combined, all of this results in a absolutely epic movie."
No Name,5,Original and amazing. The origin or red pill. Loved it.
No Name,5,"A groundbreaking movie at the time. The effects used are fairly common today but at the time the movie was made, these effects were largely unheard of.  Keanu's stoic acting style was a perfect fit for this role. The philosophical questions the movie raises are amazing and so relevant as we continue to move toward more VR / ER in daily life."
No Name,5,"A very good movie. It was definitely the best of them all.
Um filme muito bom. Com certeza foi o melhor de todos."
No Name,5,These are films that open our minds to a new way of seeing the world.
No Name,5,"This film causes someone to really think about life, and if we dare, to question what we have perceived. A thought provoking film!"
No Name,4.5,The matrix has a very interesting story and characters with great cgi for the time and epic action scenes.My favorite part of the movie was agent Smith who is undoubtedly one of my favorite movie villain of all time.
No Name,5,The definitive genre bending sci-fi action movie with a compelling story and set of characters.  Absolutely my favorite 'chosen one' story and definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.
No Name,5,"The Matrix is a legendary film that everyone must see at least once in their lifetime. The only issue that I have is that it is not original as everyone claims. It's nearly a direct copy and paste of the book ""Neuromancer"" to the point that it's borderline ripoff. Even so, you must see this movie."
No Name,4,"The Matrix is the 1999 classic directed by the Wachowski siblings. It tells the story of Neo played by Keanu Reeves who is asked by a mysterious man called Morpheus played by Lawrence Fishburne to go on an adventure that reveals that Neo's reality is not reality but a cyber world created by AI robots who enslaved humanity. This classic film introduced many concepts that have become part of pop culture such as taking the red pill and it has many philosophical influences from Alice in Wonderland all the way to the Bible. Its a science fiction thriller filled with high stunt action sequences including the iconic slowmo. The acting is not always as great though the philosophical Morpheus played by fisher is a compelling character and Hugo Weaving as the antagonists Agent Smith is a fierce villain. Matrix is a cultural phenomenon and although the effects are starting to age, the film still holds up many years later."
No Name,4.5,"So much fun, thrilling movie with a brilliantly executed concept."
No Name,4.5,"The action is visceral, well choreographed, and badass. The story is tight and never misses a beat. A great villain. A great concept."
No Name,5,This was a great movie. üëç
No Name,5,Honestly I've never tripped so much about a film. Til this day I've never completely understood the Matrix.
No Name,5,"The Matrix is absolute game changer for the genre and action film-making in general whose influence resonates throughout the industry to this day. One of the best movies in a historic year for movies, the Matrix ties a culmination of influences in concept and stylization and delivers a powerful vision that rattles all senses."
No Name,5,"To be honest, this movie helped to shape perspectives into the new world of technology! The first Matrix movie is great for talking about perspectives on reality and what it means for something to be ""real."" Plus don't forget how this movie sparked the love of bullet time? Oh, and don't forget the look of the characters. 
It was a great movie."
No Name,5,"This is a sci-fi movie that gives you fun. it's so whacky, amusing, and exciting. Granted, you have to pay really close attention for the plot but, it is really good."
No Name,5,"It doesn't get better in Sci-Fi. This is Sci-Fi that olds together on every level. It also like all good Sci-Fi explores what it is to be human. In this case, focusing on the consciousness and the meaning and essence of reality. This is one everybody must see."
No Name,4.5,"""I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.""

I've never been great at philosophy, but my head is exploding at the many different philosophical questions the film explores while still keeping even footing on all of them and keeping them from a messy disaster, largely because as the quote above states outright, it's like an intro course, a 101. The movie only shows the start, but you have the choice to dig further.

And the movie completely gives as much as you're willing to put into it. There's ideas of body and gender dysphoria, made clearest at its inclinations of body horror and the control of what you are perceived as by others, made both physical and mental. What do you define as real, the realistic scientific hypothesis or something more spiritual than that? The Matrix entails the systems of control and its chains, describing itself as a political government controlling force (Rage Against the Machine in the credits makes this completely unsubtle), but it's also mental self-imposed limitations, with clear Zen inspiration, as well as a social control of who you are. The physical limitations to break the boundaries (learning martial arts) is still not as important as the mental limitations, that ultimately removing the obstacles (revolution) is not necessarily physically violent but a mental choice of enlightenment.

And again, somehow this does not end up a mess. Even its biggest thread, the one it hammers home the most, fate and free will, still stands tall throughout. Neo does not have to be The One, it's up to himself whether he believes he is or not. That the motivation you have does not have to align with destiny as it's prescribed, and the path you choose to walk down is still completely up to you. The call is not binding.

It's crazy, also, how much this movie works with the theory of gender identity, if you're willing to read it that far. The body horror isn't just for show. When the truth of you being a slave to others' concept of identity is learnt, you can at once find your body a prison, chains putting you down, finding your body horrifying and terrifying, made physical through the lens of sci-fi as metal lumps on your skin, a perceivably permanent mark, and you have to come to terms with your physical self.
Ultimately, even physically going against that boundary is different from the mental dysphoria, that it alone is its own self-imposed limitation. You can learn everything about how your body works (the programs to learn fighting and anything you need to know), but it ultimately does not remove how you define yourself mentally and how you are capable of changing. 

This movie fucking owns is what I'm trying to say.

You can choose not to engage with any of its readings and be totally fine. Visually it is a stunning film strung well by its Hong Kong influences, with great wirework. I think the best fight scene that shows how well put together the choreo as well as edited is Smith vs. Neo, how it understands fundamentals like showing a punch twice for effect, while grounding the fights in its airy spirituality.
Wachowskis really love catching the eye with pan shots, both vertical and horizontal. Thinking of the one take of them behind the walls as they vertically climb, claustrophobic but still visually interesting.
This whole film does a great job of making the frame claustrophobic. Good example is in the office where Neo sees the agents and crouches, keeping the whole cubicle in frame.

It can't be said how much visually this inspired so many things later that I came into contact with before this movie. A list would be longer than my lifespan, especially its influence on how guns are used in fiction period, but I think the craziest one I noticed this run around was how Half-Life 2 uses a sequence near the end of the film of Neo running away from the agents up a staircase through an apartment, almost completely visually re-created in HL2 when running from the Combine in nearly the same scenario. Inspiration begets inspiration, considering how greatly well read the film already is, taking stuff from Baudrillard and Alice in Wonderland in equal measure.

I firmly approve of Don Davis' work on the score. The horns here are great, and the Matrix theme now with its blaring at the start fading into the code is recognizable everywhere. Also when the violins get furious.... it bangs. Soundtrack, on the other hand, good-ish? I'm completely down for the credits Rage Against the Machine song, having bars like ""Departments of police, the judges, the feds / Networks at work, keepin' people calm / You know they went after King / When he spoke out on Vietnam""... but it also goes right into a meh Marilyn Manson song... also Marilyn Manson. 
It's not nearly always like that, it has some good big beat and trip hop music throughout, like the seamless transition in the rave from Massive Attack to The Prodigy, and the Rob Dougan song with the red dress scene is good.

The characters themselves are pretty good although this movie does take the approach of more motivations as symbols than fully fleshed out characters, such as Cypher being the blatant rejection of truth (ignorance is bliss), and while Trinity does have her own agency to a point something feels off about the romance, and whether or not it earns the possible true love's kiss it spins.

I'm not sure why people dislike Keanu's performance so much here. To me the common man not becoming super emotional on the outside as much as through his motivations in his actions works well for what eventually becomes a spiritual figure throughout the trilogy, or so I've been told. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving outperform everybody else though. I will die before forgetting Weaving's ""Smith"".

There's so many layers to the film, even if small, to unravel here, but overall easily worth my time to come back. Gender dysphoria, government control, Zen/Buddhist/Taoist influences, Alice, communism... the movie was made for me. And it fucks."
No Name,3,"Well, the plot itself is not really that great. What make this become a well-known movie is because of the astonishing CG at the time when this movie came out. So I do not think I can judge this movie in an objective way."
No Name,4.5,An amazing film the concept is great and lots of effects still hold up to this day
No Name,5,"AMAZING 

Great dystopian future, amazing music, break-throw visual effects. cool ending"
No Name,5,"All style and substance for one of cinema's groundbreaking sci-fi classics!

Directors Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski changed science-fiction and action thrillers forever with their iconic neo-noir sci-fi thriller The Matrix (1999). The Wachowski Sisters' script is full of pastiche and homages to Dark City, Tron, and Blade Runner among Westerns and martial arts films. Their directing style is frenetic action shootouts with bullets blazing and fantastic visual effects to the moody atmosphere of neo-noir aesthetics. The Matrix has it all with slow motion bullet time combat, bullet dodges, fearsome machine sentinels, and ruthless computer program vanguard Agents. The Wachowski's high concept sci-fi ideas can get confusing, though everything is explained from our reality being a computer simulation called The Matrix to the real world falling into darkness after a machine uprising. It's chilling and fascinating in every scene as you attempt to figure out all of these mind numbing concepts.

I appreciate and understand The Wachowski Sisters' complex sci-fi story more now that I'm older as Neo's choices were an allegory for their own transgender transformations, while also speaking to humanity's endless desire for technological progress into artificial intelligence. Having machines with advanced AI wipe out humanity, only to harvest us for energy after we destroy the Sun is a mind boggling plot, but a compelling dramatic narrative. I adore the romance drama between Neo and Trinity as well among the other themes like going against fate by choosing your own path to walk. The Wachowski Sisters never quite wrote any film as succinct and absorbing as The Matrix, honestly. The Matrix really is a one of a kind miracle of filmmaking.

Canadian actor Keanu Reeves is iconic as Neo in The Matrix with his stoic confusion and endearing normality. Keanu can be the everyman as well as a tender romantic hero once he is focused and confident as The One. American acting legend Laurence Fishburne is enthralling as Morpheus with his endless wisdom and shocking reveals. Canadian actress Carrie-Anne Moss is sultry and sincere as Trinity with her fearless fight sequences and sweet romantic moments with Neo. Australian acting hero Hugo Weaving is terrifying, hilarious, and intriguing as the rogue Agent Smith with his pure hatred of dissidents and loathing of humanity. His enunciation makes his every line memorable and seething with an inner rage. American character actor Joe Pantoliano is fantastic as the dejected and selfish Cypher.

Gloria Foster's Oracle is charming and insightful with a unique appeal. Marcus Chong is fun as the nervous and excitable Tank. Paul Goddard and Robert Taylor nail the cold robotic movements and tone of Agents Brown and Jones, respectively. You can feel the difference in how Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is supposed to be unraveling into a mechanical vendetta and raving AI personality. Julian Arahanga's Apoc is cool, but it is Belinda McClory's Switch who utters the chilling famous last words, ""Not like this."" Anthony Ray Parker's boisterous Dozer and Matt Doran's zealous Mouse are interesting. Marc Aden Gray's Choi sounds just like John Malkovich. Every Matrix actor and actress fulfilled their character acting role to perfection.

Editor Zach Staenberg cuts so sharply and quickly from wide shots to close-ups that you'll never get bored for The Matrix' 136 minutes. Cinematographer Bill Pope brings The Matrix to life with gorgeous and creative shots that utilize John Gaeta's innovative visual effects to their full potential. From the startling Agent Smith morphing from other people into Hugo Weaving to the breathtaking close-up of Neo and Trinity kissing with literal sparks flying in the background. The Matrix has a neo-noir style and Bill Pope really outdid himself with these fierce and unforgettable shots. Owen Paterson's production design looks gritty from ruined buildings to the chilling robotic world and mechanisms everywhere. All the practical effects are so gross and scary.

Composer Don Davis has this inspiring melody for his score to The Matrix that I love. The ending with Rage Against the Machine is exhilarating to the main theme of The Matrix being eerie and exciting. All the rave Rob Zombie music to the symphonic unsettling orchestration is all brilliant. The sound department went crazy with the emphasized hits and ambiance to the machines churning and revving to life. 

Costume designers Kym Barrett and Lyn Askew must have found all the black leather and latex in the 1990's as everyone looks slick and unique in The Matrix. From Agent Smith's tailored suits to Neo's trench coat or Trinity's sexy black leotard. Deborah Taylor's creative make-up makes Keanu Reeves even more handsome, Laurence Fishburne even cooler, and Carrie-Anne Moss ethereal as Trinity. I just love her so much.

In conclusion, The Matrix is worth seeing again and again as it is smart and thrilling sci-fi."
No Name,3.5,The Matrix is an okay movie. The best part of the movie is the cast but in general it feels outdated to this day.
No Name,3,"With as big as of a movie fan I am, this is actually the first time I‚Äôve seen The Matrix, and after finally seeing it I feel underwhelmed. Despite the revolutionary special effects, high octane action sequences, a promising story and a great ensemble cast, the film falters in its overall execution. The story is beyond overly confusing with large amounts of exposition to catch up the viewers on what‚Äôs happening. The film asks intelligent existential questions and develops an intriguing universe to accompany it, but the interest level begins to fall when it is over-beard with confusing explanations as to what‚Äôs going on with characters I don‚Äôt find too particularly engaging. Although the film is a historic standpoint in special effects and storytelling, in my opinion the film feels dull and exhaustingly boring."
No Name,5,"This is my third revisit to this iconic movie which has significant value in terms of its philosophy at the background, its sci-fi components with the action it blends all these with. One can understand it more if one tries to connect it to the simulation theory, or Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation book (which is also shown in this first movie at one of the beginning scenes). There is much to learn and much to think about, and it really gives you the thrill you search for."
No Name,4,A story with effects sooo good for the time its now considered a classic.
No Name,5,"BEST, MATRIX, MOVIE, EVER!"
No Name,5,"One of my all time favorite movies.  Great story, groundbreaking special effects.  One of those movies you can watch multiple times and catch new info every time."
No Name,5,"This movie literally defined the new age of cinema. With an original storyline that is well written and up to point and special effects that were truly mind-blowing at the time, The Matrix is definitely well worth the watch."
No Name,5,"Original. Exciting. Unique. This movie is something special, visual effects hold up quite well, awesome and iconic sequences/Characters packed with fun action and interesting concepts."
No Name,1,Paul Rudd was not in this movie.
No Name,4.5,"Do dzisiaj robi wra≈ºenie w scenach akcji oraz walki, choƒá CGI trochƒô siƒô postarza≈Ço. Podejmowane tematy filozoficzne do dzisiaj sƒÖ aktualne i Nadar ryjƒÖ baniƒô"
No Name,4.5,"An undisputed masterpiece that shows us the future of humans and technology. Really Keanu Reeves, Carrie Anne-Moss and Laurence Fishburne make a great team for the film, and of course Hugo Weaving makes a remarkable performance. The visual effects are far superior and the editing is totally amazing. An example of what a Science Fiction movie is. Without a doubt it's the MASTERPIECE of the Wachowski Sisters."
No Name,3.5,"Matrix, Asya d√∂v√º≈ü sanatlarƒ±ndan ilham alan nefes kesici ""kur≈üun zamanƒ±"" aksiyon sahnelerine √∂nc√ºl√ºk eden, son derece heyecan verici ve kafa karƒ±≈ütƒ±rƒ±cƒ± bir f√ºt√ºrist drama olarak hala ayakta duruyor.

No Name,3.5,"It's anti-authoritarian spirit intertwined with a fresh revamp of the Hero's journey in a cyber-centric dystopia is still overwhelmingly entertaining even after 2 decades since release day. A lot of slick silliness? Sure, however the intellectualism and new take on a classical character arc make the Wachowskis' 'Matrix' a high point in cinematic history."
No Name,5,"This movie literally made me question life, and that's not done easily. This movie is a masterpiece, and it simply cannot be said any other way. Keanu's expressions and Carrie-Anne's charm create an unlikely, but astonishing, duo. The two traverse thoughts that most people wouldn't dare think about, and display it on a wide screen. This movie is one of the greatest and will continue to be, all throughout history."
No Name,4,a very interesting movie with great effects
No Name,5,... You can't really do much better than this one.
No Name,5,Godlike!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Name,4.5,"The Matrix was a crazy, thrilling concept for a movie that was executed very well. The action sequences are awesome, and the story is intriguing the whole way through. 9.1/10"
No Name,5,"""The Matrix is a masterpiece"" is definitely one of the most redundant phrases in movies history. The action sequences are dazzling, the soundtrack is enervating and the main trio is majestic. Neo looks like a character who was written for Keanu Reeves, and I can say the same for Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is another show, and his voice work is possibly the best thing of the film alongside the action sequences and their revolutionary visual and special effects. Joe Pantoliano is also funny and I loved the twist about who is the Oracle. I thought she would look like Tilda Swinton's character in Doctor Strange or something more spiritual, but no, she looks like a grandma and lives in an apartment like my grandma's! What a universe. This film successfully convinces the spectator to take the red pill."
No Name,5,"don't know if it holds up today, but it was a pretty foundational modern action film for me with a philosophical bent."
No Name,4,"Very unique, bizarre but awesome movie"
No Name,5,Best. You can choose the red one or the blue one? Welcome to Matrix.
No Name,4,"There really isn't much to criticize here as the special effects and creativity outweighed any shortcoming, but I will say that I had a much different experience rewatching this with my wife than I did watching it for the first time in high school. I remember not fully engaging with the plot the first time, but going into a rewatch already aware of the premise I found the exposition in this one to be unengaging and excessive in a purely subjective way. My wife liked this one better than either of the sequels because she loved the story they were telling and isn't a big action sequence fan. I mostly felt that every fight scene in this one was pulled straight from Dragonball Z. This is clearly the most thought-out movie in the original trilogy, and there's no denying its greatness, but I found myself actually enjoying the other two movies more than this one as I felt the action scenes were more suspenseful and I liked the broadened scope!"
No Name,5,So much is based on this. not seeing it is not understanding half of cinema today
No Name,5,Masterpiece! 100% worth watching.
No Name,2.5,"The Matrix has an interesting plot, but overall, it is not the best movie. The dialogue is confusing. The romance is not romantic enough. I guess the special effects were slightly cool during that time. I do like the fashion, but wearing sunglasses all the time does not seem practical, especially if you're inside a building. Honestly, this is giving me philosophy on crack with a spice of action."
No Name,3,"We all got into this film when it was at the cinema due to debuting first-seen special effects; or to a lesser extent if you were an Australian as it was one of the few big Hollywood films made in Sydney where we all can still to this day recognise major landmarks we walk past daily.

The concept and story line is decent although the movie hasn't aged well and is pretty hard to watch now 20 years later."
No Name,1.5,A waste of my time.  Perhaps I expected too much
No Name,4.5,"Truly mammoth film that set a standard of beauty for films of its genre. Entertain, innovative and exciting, this film manages to give everything without actually having a real ending but with a truly beautiful and original plot."
No Name,3.5,A thought-provoking science fiction film about the nature of reality and identity.
No Name,5,"Groundbreaking, innovative and intriguing, the Matrix is the perfect blend of high-octane action and thought-provoking story that combine to make it a cinematic masterpiece."
No Name,5,"Never foresee the power of originality. The Wachowskis created an almost perfect film in 1999. Cinematographer Bill Pope takes advantage of 1999 technical magic to create eerie visuals of the real world. Action sequences are particularly dynamic, fluid, and fun. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are brilliant in their iconic roles. I loved the focus on the danger of artificial intelligence and the price you have to pay to save another human. It is thought-provoking to plug into the Wachowski's Matrix. Hang on tight for a real mind-blower!"
No Name,4,"An eerily applicable concept which has resonated with a lot of what is currently present in our society. The first quarter of the movie is a bit boring and tiresome, however the messages hidden within what the movie represents makes it almost a cautionary tale for how we currently live which shows how ahead of it's time it really was. The action sequences are badass for lack of a better term with the slow motion bullet time scenes which are now infamous with this movie living up to and arguably exceeding the hype. Overall great action, unique storyline and impressive special effects for the time it was released. Definitely recommend!"
No Name,4.5,"Admittedly a little slow to start, but I don't care. This film was revolutionary."
No Name,5,"Es una buena continuaci√≥n de la saga, le falt√≥ un poco en la fotograf√≠a."
No Name,4.5,Epic! Masterpiece! This is art
No Name,3.5,"I think I watched this years ago. It's alright. Not great, but a pretty good movie."
No Name,5,MATRIX RULES and this is best from them all
No Name,5,"So very original in the story, and especially the filmmaking.  A groundbreaking, revolutionary, sci-fi film.  Messes with your mind in a fun story."
No Name,4,"The Matrix(1999), is 1 of the MOST mind-blowing films known to man-kind. 
It is a film made in the late 90s and it still holds its value today, making it a timeless film. 

The film incorporates genius sci-fi and CGI scenes that look unreal for its time. The Matrix(1999) is 1 of those unexplainable films that had to have opened many gates and opportunities for future films as well. The character cast is great, everyone loves Keanu Reeves and he plays a badass protagonist named Neo. A lot takes place in the film and it questions what is real? What is considered reality? How do we know that we're not living a simulation? Of course, it is all just a movie idea but whoever thought of this had to be Genius!"
No Name,4,"A must see movie! Good special effects that have mostly not aged at all, combined with deep and interesting philosophical discussions. Excelent!"
No Name,5,The ultimate Masterpiece
No Name,5,The premisse is so intriguing. It really makes you question a lot of things. The camera work is excellent and the acting as well. Great movie! Total must see.
No Name,5,"W przystƒôpny spos√≥b sk≈Çania do my≈õlenia nad rzeczywisto≈õciƒÖ, ≈õwiadomo≈õciƒÖ, a czasem i pchnie w stronƒô ob≈Çƒôdu. ≈öwietnie efekty specjalnie uzupe≈ÇniajƒÖ scenografiƒô"
No Name,5,"a film that changed a whole generation of cinema, being a milestone for all subsequent film productions"
No Name,4.5,"The Matrix is an excellent film, not only for its breathtaking action and cinematography, but for its ingenuity, creativity, and its integration of various philosophical concepts. Though not without its flaws, The Matrix was brave for its time; it's rare for a film to maintain broad appeal while including balancing entertaining science fiction and elements of spirituality and philosophy. The Matrix is a cult classic and changed the game for sci-fi and action films for years to come."
No Name,5,Masterpiece and timeless
No Name,5,Wow The Matrix is absolutely unbelievable the best sci-fi action film with really outstanding vfx and sound effects and really terrific cast and writing and phenomenal directors.
No Name,5,revolutionary. perhaps the greatest scifi film of all time.
No Name,5,"One of the most groundbreaking and influential films of the modern moviemaking age. Endlessly quotable lines, endlessly spoofable action scenes, endlessly entertaining film. Always fun and often thought-provoking to plug into the Wachowski's Matrix."
No Name,5,Great movie with super cool effects
No Name,5,"Out of all the matrix movies this one's holds a special place in my heart. Incredible cinematography, CGI on point, and storyline is one of the best!"
No Name,5,This movie was truly a game changer and still holds up relatively well.
No Name,3.5,Respect it for its groundbreaking special effects and story but to me it's still not that clear on what is going on.
No Name,5,My favourite movie of all time. Mind blowing when it first came out and still just as amazing today.
No Name,5,"Classic, best movie ever,"
No Name,4,This movie is crazy. I think about it a lot. Would recommend
No Name,3,"Unfortunately The Matrix definitely lost its essence in this movie. Resurrections is easily mistaken for a marvel superhero movie. 2 hours and 28 minutes of unnecessary scenes and boring jokes, which even for me, a big fan of the franchise, got tired of watching the movie halfway through. 
Yes, it has good points like good special effects, good music and good acting, but that stand out only for the budget of the movie, after all this was the minimum to be given to the fan. Definitely a 5 out of 10"
No Name,5,"It was perfect and never needed any sequel even though the demand for it was through the roof.

If you love this movie don't see Matrix: Resurrections it's a travesty on the entire franchise."
No Name,3.5,good and decent movie. not as great as the people hypes it up to be. good philosofies and ideas with decent action. best in the movie is morpheus played by lawrence fishbourne and the oracle (now missing her name at the tip of my tongue/brain) they steal the show. watch it so you understand the trilogy.
No Name,5,Blows every genre right out of the water. Enough said!
No Name,5,"Easily one of the best science fiction movies. Wonderful story line, incredible action scenes great casting and amazing visual effects."
No Name,5,Likely the best film in American History. Belongs in everyone's Archive and worthy of study in all disciplines.
No Name,5,"With a fantastic concept and brilliant execution, it really is great. Plus the action and the ground-breaking visual effects make it one of the best of it's time."
No Name,4.5,"Best film in the franchise, it certainly revolutionized the graphics industry and the way of doing choreographies"
No Name,5,The only Matrix film worth watching.
No Name,4.5,"Everything about this movie, from the storytelling to the cinematography is absolutely impeccable from start to finish. The Matrix is a classic movie for a good reason."
No Name,0.5,So.......Trinity is the one and not Neo!!
No Name,3,"Review of RESURRECTIONS.  As a fan and not a fanatic, Resurrections relies too much on an assumption that the audience cares about the affection of Neo and Trinity for one another. Fanatics probably do; fans don't.  There is little sense of triumph in the story's climax: Neo's successful rescue of and reunion with Trinity, especially at cost of their friends' great pain and suffering.  And for what? Neil Patrick Harris' character the Analyst is correct, most people int the fantasy world of the matrix prefer the fantasy.  His character, by the way, is the most fun and the most interesting.  Sad but true, IMHO, the script and execution are too derivative of the earlier editions of the Matrix, and fail you bring enough that builds upon them, for Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, or anyone else to rescue the final third of the movie from proving the project a disappointment.  Attempts to bring sympathetic or humorous robot mascots to the narrative are just embarrassing, not innovative.  The high five had me cringing. The special effects are cutting-edge, but exactly what we saw in earlier editions, and therefore were predictable more than breathtaking.  The fight scenes were duplicative, too long, and largely pointless.  It seemed the producers and director intended simply to remind the audience of what they enjoyed when the Matrix was new and fresh. Nostalgia cannot carry a movie that is two and a half hours in length. Eventually, the viewer realizes that the excitement one has anticipating and awaiting never arrives. Neo's abilities within the matrix are really rather trite, at times unintentionally laughable, compared to the ballet he pulled off in the earlier films.  Fanatics will love this film and see it more than once. That'll help the movie make money. Fans of the original Matrix edition will be reminded of how unique it was and still remains, and will be rather bored with the apparent lack of similar inspiration that seems to have this attempted remake."
No Name,1,If you are a true fan of the original you will hate this.
No Name,5,The modern myth in its continuation.
No Name,5,One of the best movies of all time.
No Name,5,Absolutely AWESOME!! One of the best Action movies of all-time!
No Name,3,"I get that it was a ""revolutionary"" movie, but take away the effects and you're left with a simple story. It's fun tho, not the best. After having watched it again, then Reloaded, I think it should have been a stand alone film."
No Name,4.5,"One of the first successful forays into the cyberpunk genre on screen, the Matrix took the world by storm two decades past. It's filled with timely metaphors and thought-provoking quandaries that lead me to ask: are you red-pilled?"
No Name,5,"This is a classic, it's a must see, please, go watch it if you still didn't.
A mark of an era!"
No Name,5,Credited by The Wachowskis imaginative screenplay. The Matrix is not only an entertaining action blockbuster that revolutionized special effects and action filmmaking it is also filled with ideas that will leave the audience discussing for decades.
No Name,4,Great movie with an interesting premise.
No Name,5,It had a very precise message about how life can be interpreted.
No Name,4.5,A classic. Truly ahead of its time.
No Name,4,"It's old, but really good."
No Name,4.5,It's so good. It is in my top 5 movies of all time. I've watched it so much and I still love it.
rudygom,4,It was good. Great special effects!
No Name,4.5,The revolution has begun and filmmaking will never be the same again. The action and visuals are intense and even the long bouts of exposition are never a bore. A truly great film and unique experience for film lovers to enjoy even decades after its inception. 9/10
Nathanael,5,"Of course The Matrix is absolutely amazing, but the 4DX thing was pretty cool too!"
No Name,5,"Matrix is one of the most influential sci action movies of all time. The bullet dodging effects, slow mo scenes and gun fights are still utilized in today's action movies but this film introduced them to mainstream cinema. It was also a film which was inspired by many other films like terminator and Japanese anime but created a mind bending concept that is very gripping and can stand alone on its own merits. This film also has strong a villain in Agent Smith. The character of Neo is also quite interesting. This film launched Keanu Reeves into stardom. The character of Morpheus played by Lawrence Fishburne is great. The only negative is that the movie does has some horrifying images but again this movie requires them to tell the story. So if you are a film fan you should definitely check out this film."
No Name,5,Just saw this movie on the big screen for the first time.  I've seen it before many years ago but this movie is made for the biggest screen possible.  A movie that introduced so many elements of current movie production and a great story.  Can't wait for the new followup!
No Name,5,Hands down one of if not the best sci-fi movies ever made I can totally see why they‚Äôre making a fourth.
No Name,5,"Temet Nosce

A quick break from Spider-Man because The Matrix is in my local theater. 

It's weird how even though I knew the plot, this movie just became significantly better and refreshing after rewatch. The concept is endlessly fascinating and entertaining. Throughout the runtime, I still had to remind myself what's real and what's not, because it's not an easy thing to accept. 

The characters were so badass in those shiny suits and glasses. The calming, mysterious way they talked and the cool dialogues just drawn me into the movie even more. Then, the action scenes were just as entertaining with amazing kung-fu techniques.

A very minor problem was the twist and romance at the end, which felt a little cheesy.

Overall, loved everything about The Matrix. 9.5/10"
No Name,5,"An instant classic from start to finish, that immediately grabs your attention from the start and doesn‚Äôt let you go until the very end."
No Name,5,my fav trans movie haha but seriously a good cool movie
No Name,5,"The Matrix boasts incredibly stylish action sequences that no action movie since can even hope to compete with and a story that brilliantly subverts a number of Hero's Journey tropes to create an experience that is unique, fresh, and unable to be replicated (even by its own sequels). 
After rewatching this movie, I couldn't help but lament over the fact that a movie like this wouldn't be produced today. The Matrix is so ambitious and unique while remained razor focused, while also defiantly striding away from narrative convention, that no major studio would take a chance on something like this anymore. 
Regardless if you want something subversive and unique, or just enjoy watching Keanu Reeves is heavily stylized fight scenes, The Matrix is a truly special movie. Despite having only been a toddler when it came out, in retrospect I see why this was the focal point of pop culture for so many years."
No Name,5,"Noticed on the rewatch the love story happens overnight, basically. Screw it, it's still a masterpiece. Let's not talk about the sequels, shall we?"
No Name,4,"Watched for the first time in years the other day, really interesting in the context now of interpreting the film in the context of the trans experience. It was brighter than I remember, visually (are all movies just incredibly dark now) and some of the effects don't hold up as well as one would hope, but there's enough ""other stuff"" going on to make this still a great film."
No Name,4.5,"A lot of movies from this era that have heavy CGI don't stand the test of time. This isn't the case here. The Matrix is still a remarkable standalone film. It has interesting characters, a really cool premise, and some of the best action and special effects you'll ever see."
No Name,4.5,"[‚≠êÔ∏è87%]

Combining exciting action, decent special effects (especially for its time) and a mind blowing plot which makes you question your reality, you get The Matrix (1999). While it's first half may be quite slow and dialogue-heavy as it explains the rules of the Matrix, once it gets into the flow of things, this film has plenty of fun and creativity to draw you in.

The Matrix (1999) certainly blew many people's minds upon its release, especially with its impactful use of computer technology, which was becoming a huge part of everyday life at the time, and given that involvement, this films plot still holds up to date.

While it's characters may not have the biggest personality, The Matrix (1999) offers a concept which is jaw-dropping and huge in terms of the world it establishes, and not to mention its revolutionary special effects and fight choreography makes it one of the best sci-fi adventures."
No Name,4,"With an original and fresh sci-fi story, questioning if our reality really is real or a program. The Matrix delivers on the action, characters, and Keanu Reeves that sometimes movies can be more than just ones and zeros."
Rick,5,A new idea that saves cinema
No Name,5,"An entertaining sci-fi adventure, combined with the Wachowski's script and direction, the performances of the cast, Davis's score, Pope's cinematography, Staenberg's editing, Paterson's production design, the set decoration by Brennan, Ferrier and McElroy, Barrett's costume design, action sequences, sound design and visual effects, The Matrix combines an interesting story and visual effects to deliver a new film saga!!!"
No Name,3,"Not bad, idea is better than execution. First part of the movie is the better part. The matrix isn't real because after Ghostbusters 2016 we would have all left it if it were."
No Name,5,I got shivers the first time I saw this movie in the theatre. Even years later this movie holds up. Amazing.
No Name,5,One of the best sci-Fi movies of all time.
No Name,4,"While the CGI is admittedly goofy at parts and the dialogue can become a bit generic, the creative plot and iconic scenes of ""The Matrix"" are enough to make this a timeless film that many people are sure to remember many years upon viewing it. Thanks to the incredible acting and the well polished action sequences, ""The Matrix"" still remains a fun viewing and one that I often find myself coming back to. Despite the obvious flaws in the CGI, it was still groundbreaking for its time, and for that I have to give the film credit. In general, the film is done very well and it is definitely one to come back to rewatch now and again."
No Name,3.5,Holds up pretty well after a rewatch. Interested to see how the 2022 movie will go
No Name,4.5,A great sci-fi action movie with spectacular effects
No Name,3.5,"Sin duda esta pel√≠cula representa los inicios de los 2000, con planos y secuencias de acci√≥n super dosmileros, la pel√≠cula se siente entra√±able en pocos minutos. Con un gran planteamiento en la historia, la pel√≠cula se vuelve muy original en su propio mundo con sus personajes. Algo que me gust√≥ mucho de la pel√≠cula fueron sus incre√≠bles efectos tanto visuales como especiales, que hasta hoy mas de uno sigue vigente. Me parece que aunque la actuaci√≥n de Keanu Reeves no es la mejor, en conforme avanza la pel√≠cula es cierto que va mejorando junto a los dem√°s actores. Algo que no me gust√≥ de la pel√≠cula es que muchas veces la historia avanza muy r√°pido, dejando huecos de guion en la trama y muchas veces confundiendo al espectador. Dando pie a muchas conveniencias de guion con los personajes para que la historia fluya. Pero de ah√≠ en fuera la pel√≠cula es muy buena, sin duda una pel√≠cula que remonta a los inicios de los 2000, y que en pocos minutos te das cuenta de su gran historia y su originalidad."
No Name,4.5,Molto molto molto bello
No Name,4,"People go to see The Matrix for it's amazing action and enticing premise, not for the emotional complexities of the characters. If you keep in mind that that's what you're seeing, you'll have a good time with this movie."
No Name,3,"it was also fine but for some reason, i prefer this more than inception"
No Name,5,"""You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."" Apart from this scene being a gift to pop culture as something that has been memed countless times, the choice given by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to the protagonist Neo (Keanu Reeves) ‚Äì who up until this point has been a hacker ‚Äì changes the course of his life as he wakes up to the realisation that the world he has been living in is a computer simulation controlled by robot AI overlords. Neo learns that he has been sought out as being ‚Äòthe one' who will mount the resistance against the AI and save humanity from the peril and illusion of The Matrix.  
Although the Matrix was released in 1999, it is still regarded as one of the best films to this day which has inspired many homages throughout the years. Impressively choreographed martial arts sequences throughout the film displaying kung fu, that the actors had spent four months learning, is expertly shown through the cinematography by focusing on the actors during the fight sequences making the audience believe that such fights could take place in the real world. In the age of CGI body doubles The pioneering use of ‚Äòbullet-time' using revolutionary camerawork by the Wachowskis also makes the action in this film something to be admired even today. Not only does the film offer a feast for the eyes but it also gives the audience some food for thought as The Wachowskis allow the viewer to interpret the film as an allegory for the Christian faith, painting Neo as the modern day saviour sent to bring people salvation. They also pay homage to well-known philosophers such as Jean Baudrillard, Plato, Descartes and Socrates by exploring the question whether or not we can be certain that the world we live in is truly real or rather an illusion..."
No Name,5,"It's a movie that has aged very well, the special effects are out of date nowadays, but still the movie is still amazing!"
No Name,5,"Thrilling, exciting, and with an amazing mythology, the Wachowski's Matrix is for sure one of my favorite films ever"
No Name,5,Groundbreaking movie. There is a before and after The Matrix in the world of filmmaking.
No Name,4,Good movie. It is all surprising on how things are confusing which is good. But there are some silly moments that I can't understand why they put it in the movie.
No Name,5,The movie was a total game changer.
No Name,4,"Whoa, dude, it's The Matrix. This is like THE movie, right? Maybe 20 years ago, sure! Its prophecies of technological dystopia are spot on, almost like a very early Black Mirror, but they aren't as mind-blowing today simply because they aren't really that far away. Does this make the movie better or worse? I dunno; up to you, I guess.

I'm sure I'm not the first one to say this, but I love Keanu Reeves. He plays this movie pretty straight, despite the somewhat cheesy script, but it works. Carrie-Anne Moss also stands out in the cast, even if her character is a little one-dimensional (but to be fair, pretty much every character in this movie is one-dimensional). The special effects and technology feel a little dated, even the scenes which take place 200 years in the future, but I'm sure it felt very futuristic in 1999.

What I love about this movie is how it plays with tropes without forcing them into the plot. It cleverly introduces a kung-fu battle between student and teacher, an all-knowing prophet with mysterious revelations, and a semi-reluctant chosen one using its established pretense in a way that makes complete sense. It knows that it's paying some homages, but it never feels forced or satirical.

Now unfortunately, I found the final act to be absolutely riddled with plot holes. Why didn't they just spawn directly in the hostage room instead of walking through a security gate to get there? What was the point of the bomb in the building? How were they able to use a stolen helicopter's gatling gun to fill a room with bullets while never hitting the hostage once? And why didn't they just show up with a helicopter in the first place?? It makes less sense the more you think about it.

Flaws and all, The Matrix is a classic with an influence that's hard to overstate. It asks a lot of deep philosophical questions which are still relevant today. It's a film that's smarter than it appears, and also dumber, but in a mostly good way."
No Name,4.5,Morpheous and Agent Smith have now become cinematic folklore
No Name,4,"While there are some facets of this movie that were imperfect even at the time (such as slow fight execution, some nonsensical pretentious dialogue and the occasional dull camera angles), The Matrix really was a game-changer, and for very good reason.  It not only created a massively engaging world of its own, using Western Storytelling Tropes to re-explore Eastern Story Concepts, but it even enhanced various genres in themselves; Hollywood Action here discovered how useful things like martial arts can be with a high-concept adventure, and the Kung Fu genre itself was reinvented with this somewhat, as that genre itself was struggling to break away from the two clich√©d setups: Murdered Master & Fight Contest (seriously, that was one of the main reasons why Project A & Police Story were so revolutionary; they conceived entirely different paradigms for the genre without compromising its believability).  And to this day, you'll still see sci-fi Kung Fu movies, and they're generally awesome, as well as (thankfully) quite a ways different from The Matrix as well.  Much of the movie still holds up, and the story hits those Timeless Story ideas that will likely always be interesting to explore, and the ending is very, very cathartically satisfying.  The acting is generally good with Hugo Weaving being particularly excellent as the immensely despicable Agent Smith (his role also being easily the best written), and watching him meet his impactful and pain-filled end is woefully gratifying.  The only real problem is that the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, dumped on almost everything good about this movie, not only retconning half of the cool ideas, but undoing numerous satisfying story beats in this movie, but those are faults of the sequel, not this movie.  Instead, if you just watch this movie by itself, it's a great time - it was awesome 22 years ago, and is still kinda awesome now."
No Name,4,"A really great sci-fi action movie. With a suspenseful and mysterious beginning, characters that aren't just 2-dimensional, and awesome action, this is a must-watch for most science fiction fans. My only minor problems are: 1. The animation hasn't aged that well, and 2. Everybody talks at a volume so quiet, it's almost a whisper. Other than that, it's not the best movie ever, but a very good one none the less."
No Name,5,"Filme magn√≠fico em todos os aspectos, pena que suas continua√ß√µes n√£o mant√©m seu status."
No Name,5,In my opinion the movie was amazing! Not only did it have exiting action but also amazing actors! If I could I would watch the movie over and over again until I get bored and guess what I would be watching it forever! I was ready to watch the second movie straight after because I needed more! Go watch it even if you have already . You will thank me .
No Name,5,"This movie is a pillar of science-fiction movies that cannot be missed by both the lover of the genre and those who are not. An iconic creation combined with the action and the special effects, deliver something unique that anyone should watch at least once."
No Name,5,Of course I would be lying if I said the first film in The Matrix Franchise was not good.
No Name,5,My taste of escape & in My opinion ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Awesome film !! üëè üëè üíØ
No Name,5,I love these Movies I can't wait for Matrix üíôVaccination‚ù§Ô∏è the 4th movie coming out!
No Name,5,Definitely worth it movie series
No Name,4,"Full of style and great special effects, though thw story can be touched upon, The Matrix is certainly a movie to see to believe."
No Name,5,Absolute must see. A masterpiece.
No Name,2,"Action scene was hilarious, but story is disorganized ."
No Name,5,"why is that this masterpiece doesn't have more 88 approval is beyond my understanding, I mean moonlight and lala land have more than this awesome crazy ass masterpiece"
No Name,4.5,The movie still holds up to this day and the ideas are still worth talking about
No Name,4.5,"To be clear- this is a a review of this film ONLY, not the Matrix Series.  The Matrix is one of the most iconic, stunning, and transformative films of the 21st Century (1999 really).   It is perhaps one of the most important films ever.   It transformed  filmmaking with its visual impact as well as its substantive content.   Its genuinely original look at the world and the place of human beings in the ""Matrix"" is complex and compelling but addictively engaging.   Keanu Reeves, Carrie Moss, and Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving give the performances of their careers in this film, which has been copied for two decades but never equalled or exceeded.   It spawned an entire generation of films, including John Wick.  It's visuals, cinematography, and special effects are ahead of its time.  It's fight and action choreography demonstrated that they can have an equal place in blockbuster fillmmaking.  Many of the concepts and language infiltrated the social language in ways only topped by The Star Wars franchise.  This one is to be seen again (and again) and still holds up.   This, unlike the sequels, is a must see."
No Name,5,"This film should be called ""Keanu Reeves Asking Questions for 2 hours straight."" It is just phenomenal how many questions he asks.

But this isn't important and I think it is primordial for me to do a proper review of this film. It was my first time watching this classic movie and the conclusion I can get from this experience is that this movie came out absolutely in the right time but also in the wrong time. It went out at the right time because it is a revolutionary movie. I never saw a movie before 1999 that had so much style. The slow motions, the fight scenes and also just the main idea of the film were so ahead of their time and I think that is why the movie went out at the perfect moment. On the other hand, I think that the movie could have been a lot better if it was made today and if the points brang previously didn't count because the only negative point of this movie is the crapy CGI which I don't blame because it was made in 1999. But, if it was made today with our technology, it would have been a bomb. That is why I want to see the fourth chapter in theatre, but, before, I need to watch the 2 and 3 which seem bad to me but I want to know what happens. 
PS: I like the voice of Agent Smith SO much."
No Name,4.5,"What a masterpiece! The Matrix truly is one of the best sci-fi action movies for so many reasons. Firstly, the worldbuilding is so interesting, so creative and it raises these philosophical questions about what's real, what your mind sees, believing in yourself and the question of fate and the first two acts do a great job with this aspect, saving the action for the third act. Speaking of action, the acting in the movie is outstanding: beautifully filmed and with incredible visual effects, choreography and techniques, taking from a wide variety of inspirations and sources and it creates some of the best action scenes and 3rd acts in cinema. The production design is incredibly with incredible cinematography and I love this green color grading for the movie. The acting is generally fantastic with Hugo Weaving pulling off an intimidating Agent Smith, Laurence Fishburne an incredibly charismatic mentor and Keanu Reeve's Neo with a great character arc about believing in his abilities and just wanting to do the right thing and I love his developed relationship with Trinity. Cypher as well is also pretty well developed and I like how his beliefs parallel Agent Smith's belief about the matrix. The Matrix is not perfect though. I think the second acts is a bit too exposition heavy and Agent Smith is sadly mostly forgotten in the 2nd act so the stakes are kind of low and I wish some of the side characters like Switch were more developed, Trinity doesn't do much in the 2nd act and some of the dialogue is a bit corny but it's an incredibly imaginative, well-written and exciting sci-fi action movie (A)"
No Name,5,"I just rewatched all three of these movies yesterday so now is the perfect time for me to review them. There is no doubt in my mind that The Matrix is one of the greatest films ever made. The cinematography and fight coreography in this film alone inspired and defined the way that action & adventure movies were created for well over a decade. This can't be a proper critic review of The Matrix if I don't bring up the notorious bullet-time sequence. While I can obviously admit that a lot of the CGI in this time looks really dated now but there are still plenty of times throughout the film, the bullet-time sequence included that are still visually stunning in their own way to this day over 20 years later. There is also a unique sense of mystery that surrounds this movie, what separates this film from it's two sequels the most is that in this movie you feel like you're a part of Neo's journey. It feels like we're slowly learning and adapting to the hidden secrets within The Matrix alongside him as the events of the film play out. There is also a deep sense of philosophy to this movie, it may not have been the first movie ever made to present and explore the idea that our whole world is a simulation, but this film is without question the one that did it the best. I also love the idea that real world pain applies to The Matrix, once you're in it's not a care-free world where you can do whatever you want with no consequences. If you die in The Matrix, you die in the real world. It gives an extra sense of intensity and stakes to the film that probably wouldn't have been there if this reality hadn't been put in place. One of my biggest complaints overall about this first film though is Cypher's betrayal. I feel like it comes way too early in the movie, a lot of the characters he kills off barely got enough real screen time for the audience to really know their characters and care about them in some way before they just find themselves electrocuted to death or unplugged from The Matrix. I feel like this whole movie would've been better if Cypher's betrayal had either been pushed back to the actual climax of the film before Neo's fight with Agent Smith or removed from the film entirely and instead been a major plot point of the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded so that we could have had the amount of time with these other side characters like Tank & Dozer to actually feel something when they both die along with 75% of the crew of The Nebuchadnezzar. Other than that and the fact that the beginning of the movie leading up to Neo becoming a part of The Matrix feels rushed, it kind of removes some of the mystery from the film overall. Besides those tiny complaints I think this movie is phenomenal in every sense of the word and it will always be a solid 10 out of 10 in my book."
No Name,5,An awesome movie that started the Matrix Trilogy!!!!!
No Name,5,"Classic must watch sci-fi movie, enough said."
No Name,5,"If, for some strange reason, you have never seen this film ...... then don't wait. SEE IT !"
No Name,2.5,"Massively overrated because of its influence on film and everyone having the hots for Keanu Reeves despite the fact that he cannot act for his life. 2.5/5 is arguably being generous. The plot was full of holes, the characters were largely unoriginal and underdeveloped, lots of the dialogue was cringeworthy and would never be said in real life, some of the acting was awful, especially from Keanu Reeves, the film was too long, the gun fights were ridiculous, the costumes/props could have been better, the visual effects are now dated, and there was a horrible green tinge for half the film. The intro sequence was nonsense, it doesn't make sense how there was a ship outside of the matrix, the tech inside the ship was laughable, the EMP should've destroyed things in the ship, the robots would have found the ship far earlier, there was no source of food, the character turning against his friends twist failed, the man who should have died after being electrocuted getting back up twist was also predictable, and then the last 1/3 or so devolved into non-stop action. However, the film was original, Fishburne put on a good performance, the hand-to-hand combat was entertaining thanks to good choreography, the cinematography was well done and revolutionary, and the soundtrack was appropriate. A 5/5 is a perfect or near perfect film. This is far from perfect."
No Name,4,"Quite a different and unique story, ‚ÄòThe matrix' debuts as a astonishing sci-fi plot with nice action sequences and remarkable visual effects."
