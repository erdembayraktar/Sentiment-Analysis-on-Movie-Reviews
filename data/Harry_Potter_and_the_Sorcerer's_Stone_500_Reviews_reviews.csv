No Name,5,An extremly good movie.
No Name,4,"This film is brilliant. The child acting is decent, the music is perfect, the sets are beautiful, the cgi has... aged. And the supporting cast! Maggy Smith, Richard Harris, the guy from Die Hard!"
No Name,4.5,Perfect start to one of the best franchises ever conceived.
No Name,3.5,"Pretty entertaining, and quite an enchanting introduction to the world of Harry Potter."
No Name,3,"Esse é bem infantil, a Hermione é uma chata (só nesse) e é meu genérico as vezes, mas tem coisas boas, como a trilha sonora e a boa história"
No Name,2.5,"É um filme decente, nada mais"
No Name,4,So much story
No Name,4,"Iconic,but can surely get boring in way too many scenes..."
No Name,3.5,O filme é divertido e nos introduz neste mundo mágico de maneira interessante
No Name,2,"i like the harry potter franchise, this one is just a bit boring though"
No Name,4,"The first installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (titled Sorcerer's Stone in the U.S.), masterfully introduces audiences to a magical world that continues to enchant fans globally. The film's production quality is exceptional, with meticulous set designs and special effects that vividly bring J.K. Rowling's universe to life. Chris Columbus's direction ensures a faithful adaptation, capturing the essence of the source material.

While certain elements from the book are omitted, such as the character Peeves the Poltergeist and the detailed backstory of the Dursleys, the film successfully conveys the core narrative and magical ambiance. The cast delivers commendable performances, with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson embodying their roles seamlessly. Special mention goes to the actors portraying the Dursley family: Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, and Harry Melling as Dudley. Their portrayal adds depth to the film's opening act, effectively setting the stage for Harry's journey.

Overall, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone sets a solid foundation for the series, captivating both longtime fans and new viewers. Its enduring appeal ensures that it remains a beloved classic, introducing new generations to the wonders of the wizarding world."
No Name,5,"This is such a brilliant entry into the series because it gives a great into to the characters, hogwarts, the general idea of the series, and their journey. The childlike wonder of the main characters is felt directly by the audience. That explains why it feels very childlike before the other movies get dark. The pacing was perfect and no moment felt wasted. The visuals were perfect. Amazing film that stands the test of time"
No Name,5,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"": A Magical Cinematic Journey
""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a film that has captured the hearts and imaginations of audiences around the world. Based on the beloved novel by J.K. Rowling, it introduced us to a world of wizards, witches, and magical creatures that has since become a cultural phenomenon.
The story follows Harry Potter, an ordinary boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard and has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry, who has lived a rather miserable life with his cruel aunt and uncle, is thrust into a world of wonder and mystery. At Hogwarts, he makes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and together they begin to uncover the secrets of the school, including the mystery surrounding the Sorcerer's Stone.
One of the most remarkable aspects of the film is its world-building. The Hogwarts School is a character in itself, with its moving staircases, hidden passages, and enchanted classrooms. The Great Hall, with its floating candles and four long tables representing the four Hogwarts houses, is a sight to behold. The Forbidden Forest, with its menacing creatures like centaurs and unicorns, adds an element of danger and excitement. The attention to detail in creating this magical world is truly astonishing. It makes the viewers feel as if they too could step through the screen and attend Hogwarts.
The characters are also a major highlight. Daniel Radcliffe brings Harry Potter to life with his wide-eyed innocence and determination. Rupert Grint as Ron is the perfect sidekick, providing comic relief and loyalty. Emma Watson's Hermione is intelligent, brave, and a bit bossy, making for a great foil to the other two. The supporting cast is equally impressive. From the wise and kind Albus Dumbledore played by Richard Harris to the strict Severus Snape portrayed by Alan Rickman, each character is well-cast and adds depth to the story. The chemistry between the three main characters is palpable and their friendship is one of the most endearing aspects of the film.
The special effects, considering the time when the film was made, are quite impressive. The Quidditch matches are a particular standout. The flying broomsticks, the speeding bludgers, and the elusive Golden Snitch all look realistic and add a sense of excitement and adventure. The magical creatures, such as Fluffy the three-headed dog and Norbert the dragon, are also well-animated and add to the overall charm of the film.
The film also has a great sense of adventure and mystery. As Harry and his friends try to figure out who is trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone and what their motives are, the audience is taken along for the ride. The puzzles and challenges they face, from the Devil's Snare to the chess game, keep the tension high and the viewers engaged.
However, like any adaptation, it does have some limitations. Some of the more complex plot points and character backstories from the book are simplified, which may disappoint die-hard fans. Also, the pacing in some parts could be a bit slower, especially in the beginning as it takes time to introduce the world and the characters.
Nevertheless, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a classic that has stood the test of time. It opened the door to a franchise that would go on to span multiple films and inspire a generation. It introduced us to a world of magic that we all wished we could be a part of. The themes of friendship, courage, and the battle between good and evil are universal and resonate with audiences of all ages. It is a film that can be watched and rewatched, each time revealing something new and magical. Whether you are a wizarding world enthusiast or just someone looking for an entertaining and heartwarming adventure, this film is a must-see.

No Name,5,It was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films.
No Name,4,"Great movie but not the best in the series

Have also watched it too much recently."
No Name,5,"“Let The Magic Begin.”

When I first found out they were making a Harry Potter film I thought it wasn’t going to live up to the books. But let me tell you they really unleashed the magic with this film. 5/5 stars."
No Name,4.5,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001), directed by Chris
Columbus, is a magical adventure that takes viewers to a world full
of magic and mystery. Based on the famous book by J.K. Rowling,
this movie introduces us to Harry Potter, a young boy who finds
out on his 11th birthday that he is a wizard. The film is full of
creativity, showing us a world where anything can happen, and it’s
the perfect start to the Harry Potter series.
The movie follows Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe), who
has been living with his mean aunt and uncle. On his birthday, he
learns that he is a wizard and gets invited to Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts, Harry makes two new
friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma
Watson). Together, they discover the secret of the Sorcerer’s Stone,
a magical object that can make someone live forever. They must
protect the Stone from an evil wizard named Voldemort, who is
trying to get it for himself. As Harry and his friends face challenges,
they learn about friendship, bravery, and who they really are.
This movie is the first in the Harry Potter series, and it sets up a big
adventure for Harry. Although this film finishes its story about the
Sorcerer’s Stone, it leaves the door open for more exciting
moments in the next movie. I would definitely watch the next film,
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, because the story and the
characters get even more interesting.
One of the best things about the film is its creativity. The way they
show the magical world of Hogwarts is amazing, from the flying
broomsticks to the magical creatures. The movie uses great special
effects to bring the magic to life, making it feel like you are right
there in the world of wizards. The movie’s sets, like the Hogwarts
castle and the moving staircases, are also beautiful and show how
much effort went into creating this world.
The movie’s characters are another strength. Daniel Radcliffe,
Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson do a great job playing Harry, Ron,

and Hermione. They are very believable as friends, and their
performances make you feel connected to them. The movie also
has some wonderful supporting actors, like Richard Harris, who
plays Dumbledore, and Alan Rickman, who plays Snape. They both
add a lot to the movie with their strong performances.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone has a lot of themes that make it
interesting. It talks about friendship, courage, and finding out who you
are. Harry learns about his past, and he also has to figure out how to use
his new magical powers. The theme of good versus evil is also important in
the movie, with Harry fighting against the dark forces of Voldemort. These
themes are something everyone can understand and relate to, whether
you are a child or an adult.
However, the movie does have a few weak points. At the beginning,
when Harry is learning about the wizarding world, things move a
bit slowly. The early scenes, like when Harry is with his aunt and
uncle or traveling to Hogwarts, could be more exciting. Also, while
Voldemort is the main villain, he doesn’t show up much in this
movie, so he might feel less scary compared to what you might
expect. Finally, some parts of the story, like who is behind certain
secrets, can be a little predictable if you are older, but younger
viewers might still enjoy the surprises.
In conclusion, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is a magical, fun
movie that introduces us to a wonderful world of wizards. It has
great special effects, a strong cast, and interesting themes about
friendship and courage. Although it starts a bit slow and doesn’t
show the full power of the villain, it is still an exciting movie that
sets the stage for bigger adventures. I recommend this movie to
anyone who loves magic, adventure, or just a good story. I would
definitely watch the next film in the series. I give this movie 4.5 out of
5 stars"
No Name,5,"I love Harry Potter it’s a great movie, I like it a lot. It inspired me during the pandemic. It’s a touching and emotional movie."
No Name,3.5,The beginning of Harry Potter is beautiful and entertaining. It is a quality movie with sweet and fantastic creatures. The characters are very sweet. It is a watchable movie.
No Name,4,"Si hubiera reseñado Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal cuando salió, habría dicho que fue un comienzo perfecto para la serie. La película se mantuvo similar al libro, y si no hubiera sido así, es posible que los fans no la hubieran disfrutado tanto. La actuación de Daniel Radcliffe como Harry, Rupert Grint como Ron y Emma Watson como Hermione fue perfecta. Si no hubieran interpretado tan bien sus partes, la película no habría tenido tanta magia. Los efectos especiales fueron buenos para la época, y si los efectos CGI no hubieran sido tan impresionantes, la magia no habría parecido tan real. Lo único que habría cambiado es el ritmo. Si la película hubiera sido un poco más larga, tal vez habría dado más tiempo para desarrollar a los personajes y la historia. En general, si la película no se hubiera hecho con tanto cuidado, tal vez no habría llegado a ser tan querida."
Becky,5,Never saw it when it first came out! Loved it!
No Name,4.5,watched all of them from a span of like kindergarten to 4th grade and have rewatched them ever since
No Name,4.5,Everytime I watch this movie I feel like entering into a magical world full of adventure.
No Name,0.5,Its so boring and slow
No Name,5,I think this is great and very accurate to the books.
No Name,5,It is a really good movie and you must must must must must must must must must must must must must must must must must see it!!!!!!
No Name,3,A very magical film. Both the books and the films with hold a place in my childhood forever.
No Name,5,"A tribute to the magic of childhood, told on film.
""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is a film that has the ability to awaken the child in all of us. It reminds us that there is always room for a little magic in our lives, no matter how old we get. The film is a tribute to the wonder of childhood, and it will continue to excite new generations for years to come.

John, Norway."
No Name,4.5,"Such a fun movie filled with wonder, great characters, and serves as a strong adaptation of the books."
No Name,4,"""I'm a what?""
""A RIZZARD"""
No Name,4,"""You're a rizzard Harry!"""
No Name,4,Solid start to the series and fun to see the Harry Potter universe come to life
No Name,4,"This was a solid introduction to the franchise.  It's by far the least plot-driven of the eight movies and the child actors have a lot of room to grow, as do their characters.  Having seen all the movies multiple times now, this one is the most innocent and naive entry in a series that will go exceedingly dark and adult, so it may be a bit saccharin and jejune for return adult visitors.  Still, the magic is there."
No Name,5,"Fantastic start of one of the most iconic movie franchises of all time. We all fell in love with the books, wich are ofcourse a little bit better, but for books to movie adaptations the Harry Potter franchise did a great job. My favorite franchise of all time."
Google,5,Loved the experience of feeling like I was in the movie!
No Name,5,I am a sucker for Harry Potter movies. I absolutely love the whole series.
No Name,4,"Although not as good as the source material, Harry Potter is a very good adaptation and that’s about it."
Jacqueline,5,"still as magical as the first time I saw it, love this movie!"
No Name,3,"Although far too many of the novel's ground-breaking elements are thrown out in this very PG-rated fantasy film, fans of the novel will almost certainly find Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to be a satisfactory adaptation"
No Name,3,Really just a classic it does have its flaws but a iconicmovie non the less...
No Name,4,I really liked the end where Harry fought against Quirinus Quirrell.
Judie,5,Always incredible….especially in the theaters.
No Name,5,"Ge wel dig, net zoals alle andere Harry Potter films."
No Name,4.5,One of the best introductions to a film series ever
No Name,4.5,The first entry is a smashing start to one of the best series in the world
No Name,5,"A magical translation of the book with spellbinding practical and digital effects, extraordinary set pieces, well-worked actors, and a director that hit every possible mark he could. I raise a cup to the team that worked on this outstanding film, bringing Joanne's original vision to life in the best way they could!"
No Name,4,"Some of the acting and visual effects are pretty dated, but this magical family adventure film has enough humor, action, mystery, and lovable characters to entertain anybody who comes across it — either if they’re a fan of the books or not."
No Name,4,have never read the book but the movie was A+
No Name,4,Good overall. The only thing that is offputting is the sheer amount of love for Harry. He’s not a higher life form.
No Name,4,"Today, I delved into the magical world of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time. This film was a massive success in theaters, eventually achieving cult classic status worldwide.

As I immersed myself in the movie, I realized that my knowledge of the story was quite limited, mostly derived from snippets of information I had picked up along the way. The special effects, particularly the CGI, may seem outdated by today's standards, but considering the era in which it was made, the filmmakers did a commendable job without going overboard.

The performances of Radcliffe and Watson were simply outstanding, bringing their characters to life with depth and authenticity. Ron's character provided a delightful touch of comedic relief, adding to the overall charm of the film.

While the anticipation surrounding the movie may not have matched the actual viewing experience, I found myself expecting a more intense and prolonged battle for the sorcerer's stone. However, I acknowledge that as the first film in the series, it likely aimed to establish the foundation of the story.

In the end, I believe that while the film may not have had a laser-focused narrative, it still managed to captivate me and left me eager to explore the next installment."
No Name,0.5,Why people watchin this after all? Absolutely lame story and action!
No Name,4,"🍅 8.8/10


So nostalgic and just filled with magic. Harry Potter and the sorcerer Stone will go down for me as a must watch film and a start of a must watch series that is injected with magic. for me will ever be one of the best franchises ever and most magical, with a perfect cast and perfect movies even perfect scores.that I cannot describe the love I have for all these films and yes, I even like fantastic beast actually to be honest, I kinda like this movie more than the book there is a little bit of things holding it back to be the best but what a great start. Grade A-"
No Name,3.5,The writing and pacing is sluggish but engaging enough while the visuals are outstanding.  It’s tough to make so much exposition interesting to sit through yet it’s done pretty well here.
No Name,2,"fine movie series but, the author is VERY VERY homophobic so I can't like it that much."
No Name,5,The boy who lived. Making a movie out of novel is not an easy task but Mr. Chris Columbus did created a school on the big screen which was every 90s kid's dream
No Name,5,"This first installment in the Harry Potter series is amazing and well done 
I remember watching this film on vhs and loved it 
There are some really good effects the action sequences are also enjoyable 

The cast was wonderful and did a great job 
I really enjoyed all the characters this film is a must see for any Harry Potter fan and any one who loves cinema 

With a great cast action sequences and effects this film will keep you entertained"
No Name,4.5,"A bit boring at a few parts, and the books are better, but overall, an amazing movie"
No Name,5,"Nearly identical to the books, loved it very much. It's been years, but it's still great. The only thing missing is Peeves..."
No Name,5,This is a great way to kick start this series! All the actors in the movie described in the book is exactly how I envisioned!
No Name,3,"Not a bad interpretation of the book, usual edits of the true story for screen adaption. 
Child actors will always pose a problem or potential risk regards convincing an audience. Rupert, Emma and Daniel are still young in this film and their acting has lots to be desired."
No Name,5,"One of the best movies of all time. Thanks for this masterpiece, J.K.Rowling."
No Name,4,"A good introduction to the world, especially for younger viewers. For half the film the exposition alone, but well done, draws you in. Still good to watch."
No Name,4,"Introduced Wizarding World well..!!

The Good:
1) Direction
2) Screenplay 
3) Story and Character Introductions 
4) Humour 
5) Performances 
6) Music 

The Bad:
1) Vfx are goofy
2) Antagonist Development"
No Name,5,"Uma incrível adaptação para o tempo, a imersão que tive é uma ótima pedida para curiosos e fãs da escrita de J.K Rowling . Mostrando como fazer um bom filme para todas as idades com um roteiro amarrado e que respeita a criação da autora."
No Name,4.5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is a 2001 British-American fantasy film film-maker by Chris Columbus and based on a script by Steve Clovis. Plot. It tells how Harry finds out that he is a wizard, meets close friends and many enemies at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and with the help of his friends stops an attempt to return the evil wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents. The lead roles. Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter. Rupert Grint is Ron Weasley a very cute and ridiculous boy. Emma Watson is Hermione Granger. When I first watched this movie, I didn't really like Hermione. The lead characters played well. It was interesting to feel the emotions of the character. The supporting characters also played their roles perfectly. The special effects of the film were complemented by computer graphics. The moving staircase of Hogwarts was partially built in the studio and then digitally redesigned. I liked the movie. I advise you to watch it because it is very interesting, exciting and have a good laugh."
No Name,2.5,"It was an ok start but was it good? No Was it bad? No It was just okay, the world building was good and so was the character development but the story was lackluster. But I can't really fault it because it has to introduce the new characters."
Shanna,5,fun to see it in the theater!
Andy,5,"Better on the big screen, loved being able to see this in theaters for the first time, as I was too young and not yet a fan of the series when it was originally released."
No Name,3.5,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a good introduction film to the franchise. However, for being a film based on magic, I feel that there was very minimal magic that was actually used in the film. This doesn't mean that there wasn't any magic used whatsoever, just not a lot. With that being said, this film is a for sure must watch."
No Name,4,The perfect introduction to the wizard of world.
No Name,1,More Harry Potter rubbish. Really poor. Watched on ITV.
No Name,4.5,"Well then, we have Harry Potter, one of Britain's favorite books and films. One of them which got popularity throughout the years and many kids and my friends have seen them when they're in school and only wished they would visit the Warner Bros world to see Hogwarts School to see some amazing stuff. Just like I reviewed the Fantastic Beast trilogy, I thought had my dream come true by doing one of those Harry Potter films since I've thinking about doing them for a while. The professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall played by Richard Harris and Maggie Smith, along with groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid played by Robbie Coltrane, had come to deliver an orphaned infant wizard named Harry Potter played by Daniel Ratcliffe, to his Muggle aunt and uncle. Years later, just before his eleventh birthday, owls begin delivering letters addressed to him. When the abusive Dursleys adamantly refuse to allow Harry to open any and flee to an island hut, Hagrid arrives to personally deliver Harry's letter of acceptance to Hogwarts. At King's Cross station, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express train, and meets fellow students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger played by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, during the journey. Arriving at Hogwarts, Harry also meets Draco Malfoy, whom the two immediately form a rivalry. The students assemble in the Great Hall where the Sorting Hat sorts the first-years into four respective houses such as Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Harry is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione, while Draco is placed into Slytherin. And now the school sessions begins trouble is brewing. I remember getting into Harry Potter as a kid since that I'm not the only one who is. Of course many people recognise the actors who played the teachers, of course everybody remembers Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore who is the greatest headmaster and and powerful wizards of all time. ""Silence!"" Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is such a lovable character. He just has all the charm like any character has ever got. We have everyone's favorite actor, Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape who is the head of Slytherin and everyone's greatest teacher of Hogwarts. And then we have Dame Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall who is the Headmistress, the head of Gryffindor and transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts. You can only see bits of John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick including David Bradley as Argus Filch and John Hurt only has one scene in it. Yep, that's all the actors that every single person in the world remembers including the main actors who are kids at the time. They'll be seeing more whilst I mention in the later reviews of Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is just your brilliantly good film to start off the franchise that everyone remembers and bring the nostalgic feel to it even if if feels like you're at school as well. I really do love the music by John Williams known for his work on Jaws, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman, Indiana Jones, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park and many more you can ever think of. I did like the visual effects even though they do seem a bit outdated but when you look at it you'll know what I mean but what can I say, this is made in the early 2000's. What a way to start off a movie franchise that everybody loves including myself. I love this film and I can't wait to do some more reviews in these. With that being said, I love Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and many more reviews are coming up soon so be ready."
No Name,3.5,Um filme bem legal e divertido mais eu acho ele bem mais para criança
No Name,5,"After watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I only have amazing things to say about it! This is the first time I had ever read or watched anything to do with Harry Potter and it was phenomenal. Even though it was two hours and thirty minutes long, and having a very small attention span, it grabbed my attention and it never let go. This movie never let me get bored with all of the plot twists and plot thickening moments. In this movie it starts out with Harry (Protagonist) living in a closet under the stairs, with his Aunt and Uncle. His life was not fulfilled, he was treated terribly and was an afterthought. Harry was a special boy, he learns that he was born a wizard. He unfortunately does not have his mom and dad to be around because they died tragically. Soon after Hagrid (Wizard) showed up and hand delivered an invitation to Hogwarts after many failed attempts. Harry quickly accepted and was on his way. After a bit of trial and error he got onto the train and met Ron Weasley (Best Friend). Ron is also a new wizard and first time student to Hogwarts, however a lot of his brothers go to Hogwarts so he is familiar with most terms. Soon after Harry and Ron were introduced to Hermoine Granger (Soon To Be Best Friend). Hermoine also was new to Hogwarts. She has a lot of sass and it seems as though her family life is alright and that they are very supportive of her. They get to Hogwarts, and are sorted into houses. Hermoine, Harry, and Ron all get into the same house. After lots of battles and conquering, and a pretty wicked Quidditch game, they go on their trek to protect the Sorcerer's Stone from He Who Shall Not Be Named (Voldemort). Overall this movie had flawless production every character had amazing chemistry together and the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend that everyone at least once in their lifetime give this movie a good watch."
No Name,4.5,"Muito bom! Recomendo demais assistir esse filme.
O primeiro filme dessa saga maravilhosa entregou muita qualidade."
No Name,4,"If the first Harry Potter's book is not as amazing as the newest ones, this first movie is at least giving justice to the book and providing great atmosphere to the story. 
The actors are still young and one can see that, but it is also part of the charm as they appear quite genuine. The older actors are great in their roles and they are able to also provide those hints that make the more attentive audience wondering if they got the movie right. 
The movie is quite accurate, although I had imagined some things differently, when it comes to propose the magical Harry Potter's world.
The movie is entertaining and not boring - I wish that also the other movies would keep up the same tempo and vibrant storytelling as this one."
No Name,5,"Thanks to Chris Columbus' direction of the film it's a true masterpiece with heart, charm, magic and of course a great script."
No Name,4.5,You can love the art and hate the artist
No Name,4,"'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is my favourite HP film. Being so young, Daniel Radcliffe is very appealing in his role. We are all rooting for him to be freed from his unbearable 'family'.  

Some very charming moments to see. I specially liked the scene at the zoo when Harry released the python, who hissed ""Thanksss"". This first film is suitable for young children as well as older people."
No Name,5,Oh My God. if u have never watched this WHAT ARE U DOING I SWEAR TO GOT THIS FILM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE trust me this film is so good j.k rowling you outdid your self.
No Name,5,I enjoy almost everything about Harry Potter.
No Name,5,awesome! pretty refreshing experience.
No Name,5,Because I'm the biggest Fan of the Series EVER!!!!!
No Name,5,"Harry Potter would undoubtedly have been a classic solely in its book form, but, thanks to the cast and crew of the film adaptations, the series has become a phenomenon. From detail-attentive storytelling to character castings that feel like the creators performed real magic to pull them from the pages, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone smartly uses its beefy runtime to tell an unmissable coming-of-age fantasy. 

Distinct aesthetics create a strong, old-timey feel with John Williams' musical score complimenting with a special magic of its own. If there's any soundtrack that can transport millennials back to their younger, likely happier days, it's the haunting and epic magic Williams crafts for the film.

The Philosopher's Stone is pure imagination brought to life, and I have to give credit to absolute standout performances by Robbie Coltrane, Emma Watson, and Alan Rickman. Adaptations rarely hit as hard as the Harry Potter ones do, but even fewer scar pop culture in a way that, even two decades later, newbies and fans alike can be ensouled by the magic here."
No Name,5,Every harry potter movie is great
No Name,4,LOVE EVERY HARRY POTTER MOVIE
No Name,5,Chris Columbus started off the Harry Potter series in an incredible adaptation of J.K. Rowling's book. The actors and special effects are amazing.
No Name,3,"The sorcerers stone overall wasn't the best movie in the Series. I think it was actually the worst, The plot wasn't as fun as the other movies, And it kept me occupied but certainly was not the best production in the Harry Potter series."
No Name,4,"I was never a huge Harry Potter fan, but then again I never gave these movies a chance. After giving the first one a watch, I am very pleased with what I've seen. Although this film started off slow, once it picked up I was interested the whole time. The action in this film was actually surprising for a movie about magic, the effects for an older movie were also surprising. This movie left a lust for wanting more, something I never would have thought could come from watching these films. The acting of these young actors was also good for people so young. This film was a great first start for the franchise."
No Name,3.5,"While The Sorcerer's Stone condenses too much book material into too little time, the fact that this first movie adaptation of the Harry Potter books is extremely faithful is clearly on display."
No Name,4,"The one that started it all. Let the magical world of Harry Potter begin. The saga of an orphaned boy who finds out that he is a wizard will enchant, excite and dazzle you with pure cinematic bewitchment.
""I can't be a-a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just Harry, just Harry."""
No Name,5,"Thanks to Chris Columbus' direction of the film it's a true masterpiece with heart, charm, magic and of course a great script."
No Name,2.5,For me it was very boring at the start  the fight was MID so was the movie itself
No Name,5,already re-watched it countless time now and still loved it sooooo
No Name,4,This film is so magical and it is a perfect introduction to this world. Great watching this again.
No Name,4,Long but fun.               ..
No Name,4,It's a rainy day and that a good day to watch some Harry Potter. This movie was pretty good awesome beginner way to tell a story about what Hogwarts is. I love the quidditch I wanna be a seeker now that looks so fun. Chocolate frogs when they came on the screen it suddenly made me crave chocolate lol. I suggest watching this movie :)
No Name,4.5,"Ah, Sorcerer's Stone, the film that started it all. Mr Dursley is a great character. My only problem is that we did not learn a lot about Draco. Love to see a spin off TV show about him."
No Name,3,"Child acting is sub par, pacing is terrible, lots of scenes are illogical and contradictory. Still good world building and pretty immersive however, decent effects for 2001"
No Name,3,The story is mediocre but the world of JK Rowling is truly magical.
No Name,5,One of the best movies of all time.
No Name,0.5,It's Could Be Better but.... I never want to watch it because it's bad
No Name,3,"To me, the weakest in the franchise, but it's still very iconic and well directed. You can overlook the dialogue considering the characters age, although at points they feel a lot older than they should."
No Name,0.5,I can't stand British people.
No Name,0.5,Boring and too childish.
No Name,5,One of the greatest film series ever made! Full of wonder and delight at every turn. Christopher Columbus does a great job with this first film!
No Name,3,I'm not the harry potter kinda fan
No Name,5,"I adore it, the best movie series"
No Name,4,Really good adaptation.
No Name,3.5,"While closely following the novel but lacking some cherished details, the film opens without the backstory dear to book readers; nonetheless, it delivers a heartwarming adventure that leaves viewers yearning to escape their Muggle lives."
No Name,5,"Amo de paixão, um filme saudavel, divertido e interessante... para todas as idades"
No Name,0.5,This is a trashy movie
No Name,3.5,"The first film in the franchise, it is definitely not a completely polished or coherent movie. You can tell important plot points are cut from the book, and (this is personal preference) the film feels much too kiddish. Other than that, it's a great fantasy adventure, successfully introducing me to the whimsical and inviting wizarding world. The look and feel of the castle and anything wizard-related is amazing, the production designer and his team understood the assignment. John Williams' score compliments this magical story perfectly, and encapsulates the atmosphere in a bottle. The red herrings and climactic plot twist show a level of intellect to the writing of this story, so I can't wait to see how the next adventures play out."
No Name,5,"Prepare to be enchanted. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is not just a movie; it's a portal to a world of wonder, adventure, and friendship that continues to captivate hearts worldwide. In a world where movies come and go, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" remains a beacon of pure cinematic magic. It invites us to embrace the childlike wonder within us, to believe in the extraordinary, and to cherish the enduring magic of friendship. So, whether you're rekindling your connection with an old friend or introducing the next generation to this masterpiece, be prepared to be swept away on a broomstick of nostalgia and wonder. Accio popcorn and enjoy the enchantment!"
No Name,4.5,"HARRY POTTER : E A PEDRA FILOSOFAL É UM FILME QUASE PERFEITO , COM OTIMAS ATUAÇOES E OTIMOS ATORES , OTIMO ROTEIRO , OTIMO ENREDO , O FILME TEM COMEDIA E TEM UMA DOSAGEM DE SUSPENSE NA FLORESTA PROIBIDA , VER A RELAÇAO ENTRE HARRY , RONI E HERMIONE SE FORTALECENDO CADA VEZ MAIS É MUITO LEGAL , E TAMBEM VER O DESENVOLVIMENTO DA TRAMA É MUITO LEGAL , EM RESUMO ESSE FILME É MUITO BOM......"
No Name,3.5,"It's been a few year since I originally watched the the philosophers stone but it still a charming and magical film.

 It's the perfect origin story and sets up the  world of Hogwarts perfectly . The star studded cast makes this film easy watching even if the children's acting is a little wooden and awkward. The CGI is less than stellar but the story is compelling enough to enjoy the experience and root for our young hero's"
No Name,3.5,"The CGI struggles at times and the characters aren't all that well developed, considering who they are as people, but Harry Potter's first big-screen blockbuster adventure is a magical and downright exciting film for the whole family."
No Name,4.5,this movie does a fantastic job adapting the book and then some. however the harry potter universe was done better in almost every other movie that came out.
Kathleen G,5,"I saw Sorcerer’s Stone with my 2 sons the day it came out in 2001. Today, I saw it again on the big screen with one of my sons (the other son was out of town). It was so fun and nostalgic. The film is, as always, delightful and magical!"
No Name,4.5,Great adaptation of the first Harry Potter book. Good fun for all ages.
No Name,5,"Es mi saga favorita, es que es todo perfecto, los actores, el decorado, la música. Es imposible ponerle ninguna pega"
No Name,5,A classic.  Close adaptation to the first book of the series-- a must see.
No Name,5,The story telling is on another level!
No Name,4,"Great introduction to the Harry Potter world, as naïve Harry discovers some of his past, leaving many mysteries still to be solved."
No Name,4,Rewatching the Harry Potters in order. The first in the magical world of Harry Potter as they first go to Hogwarts and get placed into their houses.
No Name,5,"Philosopher's stone is the perfect movie, is not boring, don't give us the sense that we miss something. The outfits are great, but the SPECIAL EFFECTS are the magic of the movie, specially when someone is flying. Harry potter was made to watch in Theaters, the magic of the scenes increases on a big screen. A lot of beautiful landscapes and photography, a perfect soundtrack. The most well-produced fantasy movie of all. The script is perfect! A movie full of magic! Eternal."
No Name,4,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone introduces audiences to the magical world of J.K. Rowling's imagination, expertly weaving together enchanting visuals, endearing characters, and a captivating narrative, setting the stage for an iconic fantasy series that continues to captivate generations."
No Name,3.5,"Great way to show us into this new world through the eyes of a first year as we are as well. Great story and fun action!

Overall
8.8/10"
No Name,3,"Worst Harry potter film, big differences between the film and the book"
No Name,5,The fiction story was amazing in a wonderful world with detailed characters and many surprises. must see!!
No Name,5,best movie franchise ever
No Name,5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  FuLLMovie 🎬 HD (QUALITY) please watch full movie https://nazmovies.xyz/movie/tt0241527
thank you verry much"
No Name,5,"For the first entire for the series, this film does a remarkable job. The film felt a magical roller-coaster ride when watching. Chris Columbus does an outstanding job bringing the Harry Potter books to life."
No Name,3.5,The acting was a little cringe. And the cgi is really outdated. But the sets are beautiful. And the music is perfect. The story is engaging and starts the series of with a bang.
No Name,5,An instant classic full of magic!
No Name,5,"The film The Harry Potter series 1 is based on a book by J.K.Rowlling.
The film is based on London.
The film was filmed on location in London.
The film is about Harry's origins for example, who killed Harry's parents,why is Harry famous in the magic world. 
He became famous because he fought off ""Voldemort"", the man who killed his parents. He's regarded as one of the most powerful guy in the masic world.  The scar on his face comes from fighting back. So, he is said ""Star"". There are many more sequel to this story and every time we see it, every story is a captivating film. There is a large cast of film, all of whom are very interesting."
No Name,5,"The film does an excellent job of bringing the beloved characters from the book to life on the big screen, with standout performances from the talented cast."
No Name,4,Does a good job of establishing the world of Harry Potter but at times the writing is dry and the child performances are off.
No Name,2.5,"Arguably the worst of all the Harry Potter movies.
It does play it safe when with it's source material it should of expanded our imagination a bit more, especially with a two and a half hour runtime."
No Name,2.5,"I liked this movie, but it had some serious flaws. It is by far the worst of the Harry Potter movies in my opinon. The movie focuses too much on worldbuilding for the next movies. The main plot of the movie does not even get introduced until well into the movie, and even then the main plot gets a back seat to the world building. It's interesting to see the characters behave in the situations they are put in, but not as interesting as if these situations actually had some relevance to the plot. I feel like if this movie was released in modern times, it would not have had any sequels, much like many other movies that focused too much on setting up a sequel and forgot to be a good movie itself. All that having been said (or typed?), I would still say this was an okay movie - it was very charming and it's an even better watch when you know what the future holds."
No Name,3.5,There was a lot of set up but it was enjoyable for the most part. Solid casting and great score. CGI was a little rough. I will say this is like a perfect movie for children.
No Name,5,"This movie is perfect! I honestly don't know how anyone could say otherwise. Every time I watch this movie, I cry. It is so good. No other movie has been able to live up to its magical feel for me personally. The casting is absolutely perfect, and it's clear that every actor dug deep into their role. I love this movie so much; it has my whole heart. ❤️ J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, and her incredible imagination is expressed throughout this movie. I 10/10 recommend!"
No Name,3.5,"A good movie to starts the Wizarding World, and a good adaptation of J.K. Rowling's book. It has a great cast, good direction and some of his time's best visual effects. It surely does a good work to adapt a 300-pages book into a 2 and a half hour movie that avoids the less interesting parts."
No Name,5,I am Ron，Must buy 1 to 8
No Name,4,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was an amazing movie. I loved the special affects, and the kid actors and actresses were very cute. I watched this movie today, so it is very fresh in my mind. Bit the reason I rated it 4 stars instead of five is because I didn't like Snape and Dumbledore in the movie. They almost whispered their lines, they were so quiet and much much more boring in the movie than in the book. In the book Professor Snape and Dumbledore were very important characters in the book, but in the movie Professor Snape and Dumbledore were unnecessary characters. Also a thing about the first 3 Harry Potter movies that I have watched is that Peeves the Poltigist is not in the movies. He is a character in the Harry Potter books that plays tricks on everyone. The filmmakers probably didn't have enough time for the troubled troublemaker. I give this movie an 85%. What a good movie."
No Name,5,"Olhando para o lado crítico, o filme apresenta cenas marcantes e cria um laço afetivo de cada personagem, além disso ele consegue mostrar muito bem como funciona as coisas, tudo isso de uma maneira divertida, o filme lembra bastante ser infantil mesmo com cenas de muita ação atraindo todos os públicos... e com isso temos um filme exelente para todas as idades..."
No Name,0.5,Why would headmaster punish children for walking in the dark by making them spend all night in the forest. Ridiculous nonsensical stuff. The CGI and green screen were all so pretty obvious
No Name,5,this is a classic awesome movie!
No Name,4,a good kick off to the harry potter series!!
No Name,5,"Reading the books and watching the movies all over again (one after another) so I can compare how well they match up. Well, HP & the Sorcerer's Stone is just phenomenal.

Yes, they had to cut some characters and scenes from the book to make the movie watchable in one sitting. There were only a few creative changes that led to problems. One that comes to mind is the changing of Quidditch game order (versus the book) and including Dumbledore at the game applauding where Harry's broomstick is cursed. This contradicts the notion that the antagonist couldn't perform such evil magic in the presence of Dumbledore (as is the case in the book). Removing the logic puzzle from the trials to reach the stone also somewhat contradicts Dumbledore's awarding of points to Hermione in the movie.

Overall, these slight changes do not really detract from the nostalgia, experience, and incredible following of source material. I conceive that the movie lives up to the book and will remain a nostalgic re-watch for years and years."
No Name,5,"So this is a little weird.
I was in another movie site and the name of this movie Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's stone is actually called Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone. 
I was really weirded out and I had to look sure enough on Rotten 🍅's this sight called the movie The Sorcerer's Stone.

Is this a Mandela Effect?
Are we really in The Matrix?

Love you All 

If you want to check this out go to Wikipedia 

Or Movie Database the movies and the cast are exactly as the sorcerers stone?

Does CERN want us to know we are in different dimensions simultaneously?

Peace be with you!"
No Name,5,"After reading the book, I definitely had to watch the movie and I loved it."
No Name,5,"Excelente película, un inicio brillante de lo que seria una saga de películas histórica. Es una excelente película y en mi opinión, a pesar de sus pequeñas fallas, es perfecta, ya que con esta empezó todo y sentó las bases del mundo mágico de Harry Potter, logrando que una gran cantidad de gente sea fan de esta franquicia. Se puede decir que esta cinta y la siguiente son las más infantiles, sin embargo nunca me lo pareció ya que yo pienso que el film tiene momentos muy oscuros y perturbadores con los que un niño de esa época podría tener pesadillas. El cast, principalmente el del trío protagonista compuesto por Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint y Emma Watson, es excelente. Por otro lado, cuenta con una gran cantidad de actores de renombre que brindan una brillante actuación también como lo son Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Tom Felton, etc. Una de las cosas mas destacables de la cinta y de la saga es su banda sonora, en este caso compuesta por el maestro John Williams, quien nos trajo uno de sus mejores trabajos y también uno de los más recordados de su carrera con una sintonía perfecta con toques divertidos, alegres, misteriosos y mágicos, dándole un toque hermoso y especial a la franquicia. Los efectos especiales, a pesar de que ya quedaron viejos, creo que no se ven tan mal, tiene algunas cosas que se ven notoriamente falsas o hechas por computadora pero no es un escandalo visualmente. En conclusión, una excelente película, un clásico del cine ya que es el inicio de una de las sagas mas populares del siglo XXI, dándonos una presentación del mundo mágico y la primera aparición del trio protagonista que nos iba a maravillar durante todas las películas. Muy recomendada."
No Name,5,"Personally, I love this movie which is directed by J.K. Rowling. This movie is very interesting with good visual edits and I must say this is a good movie to watch."
No Name,5,"harry potter is my life, words can't describe the perfection of the books and the movies and how i adore this franchise ,harry potter and the sorcerer's stone is just magical, wholesome, scary, cosy, mysterious, interesting, BEAUTIFUL movie that is a must watch for EVERYONE. a definitive, flawless 5 stars"
No Name,3.5,"Para um início de franquia, Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal é sem dúvidas um marco na história tanto do cinema, quanto da literatura. Seu roteiro pode ser simplório e conveniente, mas é inegável o quão boa é a sensação de conhecer esse mundo e suas magias, reunindo elementos que podem agradar pessoas de todas as idades. É uma bela opção de entrada para os aficionados em filmes do gênero, além de contar um elenco super carismático."
No Name,2.5,It was fine just REALLY BORING
No Name,3.5,"A great children film with a lot of charm, plot could be better"
No Name,4,A pretty great adaptation of the book which with a 4k transfer looks better than ever.
No Name,5,"Que inicio de história maravilhoso, este filme é realmente uma inovação para o cinema na época, por conta de se tratar de magia e não ser apenas mais um filme genérico de magia, como muitos que eu encontro por ai. 
O filme contém um roteiro super interessante, sendo uma história rica, que voce a cada hora quer entender mais e mais, sem contar que possui personagens muito carismaticos"
No Name,5,The greatest 02 hours: and 32 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Name,4,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers/Philosophers Stone"" is the perfect example of how to begin a long film franchise."
No Name,4.5,The movie is true to the book and didn't leave anything out of the book!
No Name,4.5,Awesome! A modern classic movie that is memorable and loyal to the book
No Name,5,"Final Thoughts:

Harry Potter would undoubtedly have been a classic in its book form, but, thanks to the cast and crew of the film adaptations, the series became a phenomenon. From detail-attentive storytelling to character castings that feel like the creators performed real magic to pull them from the pages, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone smartly uses its beefy runtime to tell an unmissable coming-of-age fantasy. A strong, old-timey feel creates distinct aesthetics, and John Williams' musical score is a special magic of its own.

No Name,5,Great beginning to a great movie!
No Name,4.5,"Beautiful special effects and music, and great performances from the cast makes Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone a must-watch for the entire family and is a great start to a fantastic series."
No Name,4.5,"harry potter and THE SORCERER'S STONE directed by Chris Colombus and based on fantasy and mystic movie and adapted by J.K Rowling and Steve Kloves , the main characters are harry potter for Daniel Radcliff ,Ron weasley for Rupert Grint and Hermione Granger for Emma Watson . The films is about harry leave in her uncle in america and her aunt but harry  is a orphelined son with a star of sorcerer parent and harry not say is a sorcerer but a misterious death and on the eleven birthday he go to the ogwarts in poudlard .the script is very emotional and it a concentration of harry and her how to act in the film . My opinion on the film harry potter and the sorcerer's stone is a mystic and emotional film for a large comunity its a good film to watch on familly .Generally I find this film is long bus fascinating I recommend this film for watch in familly ."
No Name,5,"This movie is phenomenal. If you haven't watched it, watch it. If you have watched it, watch it again."
No Name,4,"I think the movie is a great opener for the franchise of Harry Potter and is a very enjoyable family entertainer, and Chris Columbus does a heck of a job in direction, as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine in this film in their respective roles and it's cute seeing them 3 as 11 year olds trying to find out something. But this movie is definitely not the best in the franchise but still packs a heck of a punch."
No Name,4,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a film that will transport viewers to a world of wonder and enchantment. From the moment the opening credits begin to roll, audiences are swept away by the stunning visuals, soaring score, and captivating performances.
 
One of the strengths of the film is its ability to capture the spirit of Rowling's beloved book series. From the charmingly British setting to the quirky characters, the movie perfectly captures the essence of the story. Fans of the books will delight in seeing their favorite scenes and characters brought to life on the big screen, while newcomers to the series will be captivated by the film's unique blend of magic and adventure.
 
At the heart of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is its trio of young heroes. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson shine as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively, bringing a perfect blend of humor, heart, and heroism to their roles. Radcliffe, in particular, is a revelation as Harry, imbuing the character with a vulnerability and determination that make him an instantly likable protagonist. Grint and Watson, meanwhile, provide strong support as Harry's loyal friends, bringing their own unique charms to the roles.
 
The supporting cast is equally impressive. Richard Harris is perfect as the wise and kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore, while Maggie Smith brings a stern authority to her role as Professor McGonagall. Alan Rickman is also outstanding as the snide and sinister Professor Snape, a character who becomes increasingly important as the series progresses. Together, the cast creates a rich and diverse tapestry of characters that are both memorable and engaging.
 
Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes. The Hogwarts School is brought to life with breathtaking detail, from the moving staircases to the enchanted portraits lining the walls. The special effects are also impressive, particularly in the scenes involving Quidditch, a magical sport played on flying broomsticks. John Williams' iconic score is the perfect accompaniment to the action, conveying a sense of wonder and excitement that perfectly captures the spirit of the story.
 
Despite its many strengths, however, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is not without its flaws. The pacing can be a bit uneven at times, with some scenes feeling rushed while others drag on. The film also has to condense a lot of material from the book, resulting in some important plot points feeling somewhat underdeveloped. At times, it can feel like the film is trying to cram too much into its two-hour runtime.
 
That being said, these criticisms are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a film that will capture the hearts and imaginations of viewers young and old. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and a reminder of the magic that can be found in even the most ordinary of places. With its charming characters, breathtaking visuals, and timeless story, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a true classic of modern cinema and a must-see for anyone who loves movies or magic."

No Name,4.5,"my opinion  The first time I watched this movie, I was very excited about it because it was a fantasy movie and created it interesting and realistic in the characters.  It's all all of them and when watching continuously, it's very fun. If the movie comes out at each time, I think I am one of them that will definitely follow the story of this story and is a movie that can be seen.  All ages and is a movie that anyone who sees it for the first time must be excited and follow the movie from the search for information to a movie made from a personal novel. I didn't read a novel before watching the movie.  But saw people who read the movie say that the content in the novel is more diverse and more detailed in the movie and in the movie has changed a lot of chapters  But if watching a movie and going to read a novel, it might change the perspective of watching movies in another way.

 The plot of the movie is based on the story of a character named Harry Potter who lost his parents as a child without knowing the real reason and was raised by his biological aunt.  which the feasting is not good at all  His aunt raised him like he was a servant.  and when he reached the criteria that he had to study  The magic school had sent him a letter to attend as a preparation.  His parents actually said that his parents had died by being killed and had taken Harry to go shopping for school.  And studied at the magic school for the first time, got to know the friendship that he had accidentally encountered and learned through both the good and the bad side together as this friendship is like the only family that Harry  There is in life, no matter how the story is, his friends will help and take care of each other. It is considered a movie that represents very good friendship.  And saw the development of Harry trained to use in the fight against the people who killed his parents.  The story of Harry potter is a very interesting movie, if anyone has not seen this movie, it is a missed opportunity.

 In summary, from looking at and searching for information and seeing different opinions that  This movie is considered a very popular movie, most of them have to watch and are movies that can be accessed by all ages, with interesting content, worth watching and may  Getting the content from watching this movie. Overall, this movie is a magic movie, making people interested and is a realistic movie and may be different from other movies and the scripts have changed to the novel.  To have an understanding, but it may not be as detailed as the novel, for those who have read the novel may not like it that much, but it is still a favorite movie and a favorite movie for many people as well.  How many times do you think of a movie that you have to come back and watch?"
No Name,3.5,I like this movie because it is the first movie from a book I have ever watched. The other movies are better that is not to say that the first one is bad.
No Name,3.5,"The first film in the franchise oozes with charm and great characters, as we build on the stepping stones the franchise will become. Christopher Columbus is a great director, the use of practical and digital effects are well blended and the world build makes it all come alive. Not to mention great performances from veteran actors and a young cast."
No Name,5,One of the best of the Harry Potter series!

No Name,0.5,Great if you are 12 or under..I can't explain why any adult would find this entertaining
No Name,5,ภาคนี้คือภาคที่สนุกและเริ่มต้นได้ดีเอาไป5กะโหลก
No Name,3,"É um filme muito longo e arrastado para um enredo tão simples quanto esse! Mas, é um filme divertido, tem ótimos figurinos, boa trilha sonora e divertido!"
No Name,3.5,"First part of the Harry Potter series of movies. Setting of scene, followed by a quest. Long, at two and a half hours. Made for kids, so adults can't really judge this content for its entertainment value."
No Name,5,"This movie was just amazing, I must have watched it atleast 50 times in the last 5 years. It Never gets Old"
No Name,3.5,its really good but like the worst one of all harry potter movies in my opinion
No Name,5,It's like they took out of my mind! A Perfect five stars!
No Name,2,"first in the series, and quite boring and tedious and long, due to the fact of introducing so many characters, lets hope the rest of the series will bring up the pace a little bit"
No Name,3.5,"The first Harry Potter film does a great job of staying true to the book, and while it isn't the best in the series, it sets the stage very well."
No Name,3.5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a masterclass is world building. This movie's world breathes and slowly discovering every inch of it is a joy, from Diagon Alley to Hogwarts Castle.

I would not say the story is overly brilliant, but that is just a catalyst for the world in this first film. Despite its minor drawbacks, it does enough to intrigue the viewer and kept me engaged. 

The performances are a little off, which is expected as this film is primarily carried by three twelve-year-olds. But they get better as the film progresses and the adults in the film are able to bring the average up with their amazing performances.

Overall, this movie suffers from being dated with poor effects, CGI, and some rough child acting. Never-the-less, it manages to create an experience like no other and I expect the films to do nothing but improve from the initial entry.

Score: 75%
Verdict: Good"
No Name,5,One of the best movies of the franchise that introduces the fantasy world and its characters in a very fun and exciting way.
No Name,4,"Overacted and confusing

This movie outright bored me. It's a story about a child in sorcery school, but it was filled with the same amount of shenanigans as any other Saved by the Bell episode. The magic he used came with alright and passable special effects, and some of the ideas that the script played around with were interesting such as Quidditch but even then, the execution of the scenes was patchy and confusing. I think it was made for those who had read the books, which are lengthy children's books I wouldn't waste my time with, personally. The actors are alright, but as children they have the capacity to overact way too much. Overall, I didn't really enjoy the series as a whole, at all."
No Name,4,"As magical as the characters within, but with a few too many conveniences."
No Name,5,"Where the magic all began: The young cast of Harry Potter's first adaption for screen delights with direction and a score that set the stage for cinematic history. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone faithfully captures every detail that J.K. Rowling created in her introductory novel while forming the foundation of an entire fictional universe, still famous over two decades later. In 2022, I still feel the same sense of magic and wonder that I felt watching Harry Potter in theatres as a curious 6 old boy."
No Name,4,"Solid Movie. The acting is good. Even though the child actors are just ok really it's the veteran supporting cast that doe a great job balancing things out. Robbie Coltrane is the best actor in the film with a great deal of charm more than anyone. The cinematography is very well done with very elaborate sets and well shot scenes. the only thing is the CGI at times doesn't look as good as the rest of the practical sets most of the time. The music is very well done also. The only real major knocks to this film are the editing & pacing which while still are solid, have a bit too many ideas. The film feels like the first half is about Harry & his friends adjusting to school while the second half is about the mystery of the stone. This is fine but the problem is it starts to drag and feels bloated. It feels like its being too faithful to the novel while sacrificing focus. Some scenes like the flying game, going into the restricted section could have been cut and nothing would be lost. Although there well done scenes. Also the first half with them adjusting to school feels like the scenes don't put together don't have a logical flow although there still well done. Also its worth noting most of this film has a very childish feel to it while the final act does go on the dark side and get more intense which I enjoyed. In conclusion despite some unremarkable child acting, bloated run time and unfocused narrative at times this is a solid film that holds up well. Definitely worth a watch for any fan of the franchise and worth viewing to get to the others."
No Name,5,Such a great rendition of the books. Amazing cast and such a delight to watch. Good effects for its time. Amazing that Christopher Columbus was able to direct that many kids this well
No Name,2.5,the worst out of all harry potter movies. Go watch the prisoner of azkabhan it's my favourite
No Name,4,"This movie has some of the best child acting and child performances that I've ever seen! I've been a fan of this movie ever since 3rd grade and it's one of the best first installments that have ever been made (even though some of the special effects don't hold up anymore and it's looked faker over the years, however it still has awesome costumes and make up). The acting from the adults were impressive as well and I really got invested in the Harry Potter universe with this first film! Imo, it's even better than the Fellowship of the Ring! Plus, the music composed by John Williams is magical by itself! While many aren't fans of J. K. Rowling anymore, she will always deserve credit for this genius and magnificent creation!"
No Name,5,Only good Harry Potter movie.
No Name,5,"This Is Awesome, First Movie Is Called: ""Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone"" It Pretty Awesome Movie!"
No Name,4,"Ok - I am having to review a movie with the wrong title because the US Publisher, Scholastic, has a low opinion of American children. The movie is correctly titled Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

I will start with where the movie lets itself down - and that is in the train ride to Hogwarts. The timing is all over the place. The train seems like it has gone for an absolute age before Ron decides that everywhere else is full. Then Hermione declares that the train is nearly there, while it is still broad daylight and it arrives in the pitch dark. 

Near the end of the film in the chess scene, why did Ron need to be riding the chess piece? That made no sense.

Now - the good bits. The overall storyline is great - yes it is simplistic, but it is based on a children's book, so that is to be expected. The dialogue has some great moments, particularly where Ron and Hermione and concerned. The cinematography is excellent too, with great use of colour. The score by John Williams is excellent - one of his best (aren't they all, though?) and evokes the magic that matches the film.

All in all, great for 2 and half hours of light, escapist entertainment."
No Name,3.5,It is that time of year again.
No Name,3,Great movie to watch with friends
No Name,4.5,A joy to watch even all these years later. The respect for the source material shines through and results in an evergreen movie that will be enjoyed for generations to come.
Tj,4.5,Such a classic film.
No Name,3.5,"A good and faithful adaptation. I like that given the age of the characters it's very much a children's movie and Chris Columbus does a good job with the lead actors. Where the movie shines is in the execution of the wizarding world. The magic world is very quirky and combined with John Williams score it has a unique atmosphere that is always a joy to return to. Still, while the movie is decently well written I must admit that I find it a tad boring, thankfully the Harry Potter movies only get better from here."
No Name,3.5,the cgi is 7.2 out of 10  the actoer for harry is  awesome
No Name,5,The first of the movie series. Excellent adaptation of the books. Great movie that will keep you entertained!
No Name,4.5,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. The franchise has been a large part of my life for most of my life. With the first book coming out when I was three years old and the first movie when I was seven, there is a special place in my heart for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

I know that it is not the most remarkable piece of art when looking at it from a filmmaking perspective. However, let us remember that this movie was made for children. When it comes to world-building and enveloping the audience, I would argue that this movie goes toe to toe with Lord of the Rings and some of the other greats.

What Chris Columbus and company did is nothing short of game-changing. They took excellent source material, stayed true to the book and built upon it. The visuals, specifically involving Hogwarts, are gorgeous. The score by John Williams is one of the most recognizable of all time. The characters are instantly likeable (or despicable). There is honestly so much to praise and love about this movie.

While not every scene is necessary to the plot, those ""pointless"" scenes further add to the feeling of magic. From sitting in Flitwick's classroom to ruminating on a windowsill with an owl, I could watch footage of Hogwarts on repeat. This is a movie that I could turn on at any time and jump right into the story. Simply put, I instantly have a warm feeling which stays with me the whole way through.

While the acting and dialogue have some rough moments, particularly with the younger actors, the casting is excellent. From Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane to Richard Harris and Maggie Smith, there is not a single dud when it comes to the adult cast. The students are also perfectly cast, with the main trio's chemistry on full display.

At the end of the day I'll say it again, I know that this is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. The movie is highly rewatchable, endlessly quotable and enchantingly enjoyable. When defining ""comfort film"", this movie is at the top of the list. Simply put, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone set the stage for one of the most popular movie franchises of all time and one of the most impactful parts of my childhood.

Best Character: Rubeus Hagrid
Best Moment: Arriving to Hogwarts on the boats.
Best Quote: ""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."" - Albus Dumbledore

Additional Note: Having the house cup ripped from Slytherin is why I have issues with premature celebration. That being said, the whole sequence is still chill-inducing."
No Name,3.5,A fun introduction to the wizarding world. Its a fun adventure and seeing all of it for the first time is great. You get to explore so many cool concepts. Its has a deep story with alot to it and its mysterious.
No Name,3.5,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a family friendly, faitthful adaptation of J.K. Rowling's classic novel, and its characters are iconic and its story is well-known, even though the effects and action are the worst of the franchise."
No Name,3.5,"A good start to a really good series of film. It does feel much more for children than the later movies which isn't as good but still not bad at all. All of the kids acting were just kinda meh in this film. I do really like Hagrid, Dumbledore, Snape, and a lot of the characters introduced. Of course another astonishing score by John Williams."

Christina,4,It was wonderful to take my daughter to see it in theater like I did many years ago. very nice experience for her. At theater itself I seem the twitters for the sound system were to high. So at some parts it got really loud.
No Name,2,Overrated movie with lots of plot holes.
No Name,5,This film just elicits a cozy nostalgia for me
No Name,5,"WEll it's actually called ""the philosopher's stone"" but I'll overlook it. 
Who could forget the epic fun with the sorting hat! So much diversity of characters. Rich posh clever girl. Rundown left for dead halfblood wizard and clumsy but loveable best friend!"
No Name,2.5,"Harry Potter isn't one of my favorite characters. I tried to get into the series when this film was first released and didn't like it. When my children read the books and watched the films years later, I tried to get into the character/story again on multiple occasions. The simple fact is this movie is just okay; there isn't anything stupendous happening, no awesome visuals, or amazing plots, so unless you love these characters already this film is just passable."
Steven C,4.5,Great to experience this again over 20 years since I saw the premiere. Wish they were playing all of them!
No Name,4.5,"filme muito foda, o roteiro é foda, os personagens são excelentes, as cenas
são muito boas ,as cenas das aulas de magia também são muito boas, gostei de como foi construido o vilão, que era o professor medroso que virou um professor terminado a matar harry potter, que tinha na parte de trás da cabeça o voldemort, e gostei do harry potter ter matado o professor com a pedra filosofal. eu recomendo muito esse filme vale a pena assistir, o primeiro de 11 filmes de uma das melhores franquias do cinema."
No Name,5,"The start of the great Harry Potter movie series, which is also a great movie in itself."
No Name,4,My rating for the film is a 8.0/10
No Name,5,A spectacular start for little Harry Potter and a great introduction to his big villain.
No Name,3.5,this movie was pretty good
No Name,2,"A lot of it doesn't make sense if you didn't read the book. For example, the very first scene when Dumbledore uses the Put-Outer -- I don't think a random person would get what the pun is supposed to be. I kept wondering how you could tweak the movie to make it stand on its own, but it would take a lot."
No Name,5,"The first thing they do when you visit Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, they take you on a special journey unlike any other. HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is an absolute gem and a remarkable treasure."
No Name,5,A magnificent first to the Harry Potter series. The book wasn't separated from the movie and kept unsuspecting viewers on the edge of their seat. Make your way to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters to board the Hogwarts Express!
No Name,2.5,"I guess it conveys it's world fairly well, but I didn't find it to outweigh all the cheesy reaction shots and unfunny humor."
No Name,5,a fantastic beginning
No Name,3.5,Harry Potter takes to long to get to Hogwarts and the effects take to long but otherwise it's a good movie. The world building is amazing. I think the first one isn't the greatist
No Name,4,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the few movies I can describe as genuinely magically, and is a wholesomely exciting way to start off the Harry Potter film franchise."
No Name,4,Great start to the series
No Name,2.5,"Now, I'm not a die-hard Harry Potter fan, but I have read the whole series 3 times, so I feel my opinion of how the book was interpreted in this movie has some merit. And it was okay. A couple scenes were taken out (like the Midnight Duel) or added, and a few characters were tweaked (like Hermione), but it was decently loyal to the original. And yet as much as I love the book, I just thought the movie was mediocre. Not that good, not that bad. I personally wouldn't recommend watching it, but if you do, it's not a bad movie or anything."
Parrfive,5,Still by far my favorite movie of all time.
No Name,5,This has to be the closest version to a book that anyone has ever got to. I highly recommend it.
Joseph M,5,It was great to watch Harry Potter in theaters for the first time
Terrence,5,Awesome. No violence but more entertaining by far
No Name,4.5,A classic story. The Sorcerer's Stone is a perfect adaption from the famous books by JK Rowling that become one of the greatest storytelling movies.
No Name,4.5,I love Harry Potter movies so movies
No Name,5,"Lembro assistir pela primeira vez no cinema e tive que rever novamente, e a mágica é a mesma ótima história na qual tudo acontecia com a curiosidade dos 3 jovens Harry, Hermione e Rony eles se aventuram numa escola cheia de segredos, que no fim todos conseguem resolver os desafios que Hogwarts propõe nas entrelinhas, além de uma criatividade invejável de muito filme de fantasia por aí."
No Name,3.5,good but slow asf at times
No Name,4,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was the introduction to the Wizarding World as we know it and it does that really, really well. While not being the strongest in terms of plot or emotions, the world building might be the best of Harry Potter films and it makes you want to continue on with the franchise."
No Name,5,The best movie in all time
No Name,3.5,"Although this movie fails to live up to the source material, it succeeds in creating a movie full of heart, and passion. This movie may have it's flaws, but there's something about the vibe of this movie that makes it magical (pun intended). The performances from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are great and fit the movie perfectly. Their chemistry really makes them feel like actual people. Not to mention Snape's actor, brilliant! The plot is good, but it's ripped straight from the book, so that's really a given.

There are certain gripes I have with the movie, though. The CGI in certain segments feel really dated, and sequences in the film can be corny. However, this is to be expected from an early 2000s movie based off a YA novel.

It's also very faithful to the original (as implied above), which is a plus, but ends up feeling unpolished, due to the fact that it has to leave out lots of things from the book.

What the movie lacks in technical skill, it makes up for in warmth. Which, really, is all fans were asking for."
No Name,2.5,"The special effects are terrible, the acting for the most part is lacking, and the movie seems to have a lot of plot holes. I didn't watch this as a child, so my critique is as a 30something. A young person may be able to overlook these things and enjoy it. I, however, thought it was overall very goofy and clearly made for kids. Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, and especially Alan Rickman save this movie from being overly silly with their acting and characters."
No Name,5,this movie is not boring it is enjoyable and this movie has amazing acting and the story is very good this movie is the best movie i saw in my life
No Name,4,"When it comes to setting up a deep and rich fantasy world while still packing in enough structure to create a good standalone film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the greats!
Although there are times when the pacing can be a bit too slow and the CGI a bit too dated, those minor complaints are nothing compared to the grand scheme of the film.
Because, whether it's the charming acting of every single cast member (young or old), the beautiful and iconic score, or the extraordinarily imaginative writing, set designs, and costumes that truly make the entire wizarding world feel real and alive, it is one of the best starts to a film franchise in cinema history! 
Up there with the likes and quality of classics like A New Hope and Fellowship of the Ring, in my opinion!"
No Name,4,"It has a great plot-twist when the real villain is revealed, but the script has some holes and some parts of the movie are very boring"
No Name,5,Great Adaptation! Perfectly done.
No Name,5,"Yer a wizard, Harry!"
No Name,4.5,"So I'm late to the show I just recently read the book and then re-watch the movie. There are some things missing in the movie that was in the book, but most book to movies are. But still what a fantastic movie, watching it right after reading the book really brings it alive."
No Name,5,I loved it! Very good movie
No Name,5,"I thought this was a very solid movie. I really don't have any complaints, no gripes or anything at all bad to say about this film. I'm obviously late seeing this movie so I'll keep it brief. I liked this film and if you are late to the party like me I'd say go for it and see this movie. It's a great time."
No Name,3.5,A solid intro to the character and the world of Harry Potter makes this a fun and enjoyable watch.
No Name,4.5,the way director chris columbus told us about this movie is very magical and visually beautiful
No Name,4,"Filled with visual splendor, valiant heroes, spectacular special effects, and irresistable characters.  It's fair to say that it's magical.  The settings manage to be imaginative and yet at the same time believable and lived in that you'll think you could find them yourself, if you could just get to platform 9 3/4.  The adult actors are perfect.  Richard Harris turns in a great performance as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith brings the right tone of dry asperity to Professor McGonagall, and Robbie Coltrane is a half giant with a heart to match as Hagrid.  Alan Rickman provides shivers as Snape and the brief glimpse of Julie Walters will make. you glad you'll be seeing more of her in the future.   The kids are all fine, though mostly just called upon to look astonished or resolute.  

Every family should see this film."
No Name,3.5,Watched it for the first time. was not my favourite but did enjoy it. had enough to make me want to watch the rest.
No Name,4,"[⭐️83%]

Chris Columbus brings J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World to life and in doing so crafted many people's childhood. Nostalgia certainly plays into making this a better film as it covers so much detail to conjure up such a hugely ambitious world, however certain elements haven't aged too well, mainly the CGI which is somewhat understandable given the year it was made. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) does a great job of easing the viewer into this world, setting the foundations for the franchise to build off of, however in doing so it does skip over a few bits which would be tightened up in the later films when it adapts a more serious tone, however there is no denying the amount of fun this film produces as well as the importance for the franchise it built.

The trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are so enjoyable to watch and lead the story, it is so impressive how strong of leads they are given their age, obviously with child actors there are a few nitpick inconsistencies but nothing too bothering.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) birthed a mega-franchise which created many childhoods as well as opening up peoples mind to more creative fantasies thanks to the sheer amount of detail executed in this movie."
No Name,4.5,"Magical. I was like 13 Years Old throwback 'n a 1st Year High School Student dropping by ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" as a WorldWide Blockbuster Film. I was a Freshman in USC-GHS who's just borrowing J.K. Rowling's Novel going out a Classmate 'coz grabbing my own down a Bookshop is heavy within Pockets. I wasn't ending up watching Film on Mall Cinemas 'coz ain't rich so just watched Harry Potter Films with a Pirated DVD which my Mother got Downtown knowing myself asked her doing so.

Okay, why am I blabbing going out Pointless Babbles.

Harry Potter.

I'm like thinking you ain't getting by Planet Earth if y'all ending up clueless going out Harry Potter. Everything is starting off with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" which is Brilliant enough throwing out an Image Twist talking Witches 'n Wizards not to mention Muggles who are Non-Magic Folks.

Everyone was so Gaga with Harry Potter throwback my Teenage Years. I know why. Why? I'm thinking what if while checking out its Novels 'n Movies somehow Folks is grabbing shots with an Escape going out ones Miserable Paths picking drifting in a Magical Fantasy like what Harry Potter is throwing.

Sometimes all Potterheads are told not ending up falling much with a Harry Potter Fever. I'm like Potterheads even know Everything Harry Potter than knowing an Answer going out ""What is Gravity?"" which is funny if y'all may ask me.

I'm not a Potterhead.

I wish myself was way my Teenage Years throwback.

Hey, I'm thinking now isn't much late going out starting getting by feeling Young at Heart.

Adz 💝"
No Name,3,"Sin duda esta película, llegó para revolucionar el cine con una de las sagas más exitosas de todos los tiempos. Aunque no sea una gran película, esta película logra ser entrañable en pocos minutos, con personajes muy originales y muy bien construidos, en pocos minutos te enamoras del mundo de Harry Potter. Me parece que los efectos especiales de esta película envejecieron muy mal. Muchos quedando al día de hoy en pañales, aunque los efectos prácticos de esta película siguen estando igual de frescos e impactantes. Otra cosa que no me encantó de la película fue que en muchos momentos la trama se siente estirada, creo que la película tiene muchas escenas que no aportan mucho a la película y eso la hace tediosa en algunos momentos. Esta película es genial para ver en familia, ya que logra ser una película que te saca un sonrisa, pero lo mas importante es que se siente pura, Una gran película que nunca te cansas de ver."
No Name,4.5,"When I was first introduced to this magical world, I was just like Harry, just amazed by everything. The movie, put it simply is just magical."
No Name,5,"Awesome adaption of the book. Except for the fact that a lot of scenes from the book didn't make it into the film, there's nothing else I don't like about this movie.
The acting is great, and the plot is extremely entertaining.
MUST SEE!"
navbrat73,5,1st time here. Just frustrated about how warm it was in the theatre and the amount of under 3 yr old. They were so noisy.
No Name,5,It's literally just the beginning of an awesome trilogy. 5/5
No Name,5,I've seen this movie so many times and each time my heart is warmed by the magical mystique of discovering this amazing world again
No Name,3.5,started watching all of them in November of 2021 after Brian read all the books from August thru September.
No Name,4.5,87%. Happiest of the Harry Potter movies which makes it so enjoyable. Get all the background into Hogwarts and get to see all of the seasons. Fun watch
No Name,2,"I liked this movie, but it had some serious flaws. It is by far the worst of the Harry Potter movies.
The movie hardcore focuses on worldbuilding for the next movies. The main plot of the movie does not get introduced until well into the movie, and even then the main plot doesn't get much screen time at all. It's interesting to see the characters behave in the situations they are put in, but not as interesting as if these situations actually had some relevance to the plot. I feel like if this movie was released in modern times, it would not have had any sequels, much like many other movies that focused too much on setting up a sequel and forgot to be a good movie itself.
All that having been said (or typed?), I would still say this was an okay movie - it was very charming and it's an even better watch when you know what the future holds."
No Name,4,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s/Philosopher’s Stone was off to a pretty good start, but there were some deleted scenes that should’ve been made into the final cut."
No Name,4.5,"cool! I'm so sorry because in 21 years of my life, I've only seen a movie as cool as this. harry potter, in my first impression, I was amazed and curious about how the next series of this film will be. Watching this film evokes a feeling of dark academia that was buried in the past. even though this film was produced in 2001, but the quality is quite good and even not inferior to films produced now."
No Name,3,"Just a fine movie, nothing special at this point"
No Name,3,Alright….. so this is how it will be.
No Name,4.5,Elite movie. The whole HP series should be watched by everyone
No Name,4.5,"This movie is just great. This wonderful intro to the world of Harry Potter is a classic. I feel like out of the eight films, this one has the greatest soundtrack. I think this movie does a great job at bringing Harry Potter onto the big screen."
No Name,3.5,"Harry Potter and the PHILOSOPHER's Stone (fuck you America!) is a good adaptation of the book. Due to the first Harry Potter book being quite thin, they were able to cover the vast majority of it in this flick. It's flawed, obviously, and at this stage the acting from the children is for the most part mediocre (there are exceptions; Tom Felton is already very good as Draco Malfoy), but still, it's a good movie."
No Name,4,"The first entry in Harry Potter is smart, entertaining, with a diverse cast."
No Name,0.5,"This movie is not good. So in order to cleanse the bad taste that left by this movie I will share a Delicious Katmer Recipe.Un, sıcak su ve tuzu derin bir kapta karıştırın.Kulak memesi yumuşaklığında bir hamur elde edene kadar yoğurun. Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün. Katmerleriniz hazır. Soğumadan servis yapın."
No Name,4.5,88/100 this is a classic
No Name,4.5,"Excellent storytelling, true to the spirit of the book. Harris is Dumbledore."
No Name,4.5,"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is the first film of this universe that the truth started in a very good way, although it is not 100% faithful to the book but is still more faithful than the other films, the evolution of Harry as a character is very Well built but I saw it as a magical version of Cinderella, from the minute we see Harry you automatically fall in love with him and it is what a movie has to do automatically with its main character that audiences connect with the main characters, With another character we became fond of was Hadrid, a character who acted as a father to Harry, went to rescue him when he was attacked by Voldemort and when he needed someone's help, the truth was he was a very good character in the plot, Ron is a character that you connect with him comes from a family with not many luxuries and that makes you love the character since he has goodness in his heart and when he meets Harry we can see the great connection in his love Istad, Hermione is a character that maybe you could see known in real life the girl in a great charisma, intelligent, kind, everything that maybe you could have come across in real life, but what we all wanted from this movie it was to see Hogwarts the great school of magic and wizardry the achievement they made so that people will fall in love with this school is a great achievement everything we wanted to see in this school we saw the classes and everything a student wants to live in It is here, the CGI is very well achieved or well it has not aged in a very good way but it is well achieved, the soundtrack is good and when you listen to it it makes you quickly remember Harry Potter, although in this movie we do not see Voldemort or well ""He who should not be named"" is a character that although we do not see him 100%, the magnitude of this villain and his intentions are still felt, in conclusion Harry Potter is a great franchise that started in a very good way"
No Name,4,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to this day, is still as visually please and appealing as it was when it first released. Everything still is extremely solid, from the acting, to the story, to John Williams amazing score. For the most part, the visual effects are solid as well, apart from one or two scenes where they do look as if they are fresh from a PS3 game. The villian is particularly weak, taking a lot of the suspicion from the source material away, instead focusing on building the wizarding world and wowing the audience."
No Name,5,"Alguém conhece a música, ""legends never die""?
Bem não importa, o título dessa música já diz tudo o que eu quero falar"
No Name,4,It's a children's film unlike the later darker books and movies and I think you should embrace the magic and mystery of the first film even if it is not satisfying more mature viewers
No Name,4.5,"This movie is a great beginning to a franchise. It has all the right feelings and vibes. The young cast were a bit struggeling with the role but what can you expect with three 11 years olds. I think the director did an amazing job adapting this book to the screen. The design that is Hogwarts is beautiful.
 And the supporting cast is simply phenomenal. Alan Rickman as Snape might be the best casting I've ever seen. He plays the part perfect. 
This movie is certainly worth the watch!!"
No Name,4.5,"What a great way to get me into the Harry Potter series! I mostly just watched this movie because it had composer, John Williams (the guy who composes the music for Star Wars), but the movie itself was great too! This movie even got me into reading the book series, which was also fun to read. If you're not one to say that you're a Star Wars fan at all (that's how I personally feel), this is an even better franchise to get into! My overall opinion: 9/10."
No Name,3.5,This film literally has some magic. Great world building and one of the most recognized lead in film franchised in the last decade.
No Name,5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s/ Sorcerer’s Stone is the first and honestly one of the best of the Harry Potter series. As a major fan of the books I think that this film is a phenomenal adaption. Also out of the all of the Harry Potter books this movie probably follows the book the best. This film has such an enjoyable, magical feeling to it that makes it practically irresistible to watch. Granted there are some problems to it like the fact the some of the child actors aren’t perfect, some of the effects look dated, and the movie does have a very child friendly feel to it especially when compared to some of the other darker installments in the series. However despite these things I still love this movie and I wouldn’t change that in any way."
No Name,4.5,The film which started all. A beautiful film for the family <3.
No Name,3.5,"A well-made film that is also quite a bit of fun.  The main critiques against it are more some of the inherent things in the storyline that I'm sure had little to do with the filmmakers and more with J.K. Rowling.  For example, (I'll explain this as vaguely and spoiler-free as I can while still trying to make my point) throughout the film, the kids at Hogwarts are given strict rules to follow, lest they get expelled for breaking them.  Well, several rules get broken and there are no consequences--in some instances it is even met with REWARD.  Fairness is replaced with favoritism."
No Name,4,"An excellent first installment to the Harry Potter saga. It was fun, sweet, and even funny at times. The film did a great job in terms of getting us introduced to this Wizarding World. Although it is not a perfect movie and still has its flaws, it is still an easy recommendation."
No Name,5,"A classic. Although many sequels are better, this film is still amazing and holds water this many years later. If you haven't seen these films yet, this is where to start"
No Name,4,"A- 
It's a huge part of my nostalgia"
No Name,2.5,"It's a classic to many people, and it does have its charm. I enjoyed it when I watched it many years ago, however upon rewatch, it doesn't hold the same nostalgia it used to. It's alright, but I wouldn't watch it without the intention of watching the rest of the series."
No Name,3.5,"WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!

Since the whole Harry Potter movie series got added to HBO Max for a limited time, I'm going to watch all of them, and this is the first one. 

This was an enjoyable introduction into the magical universe. The script used the long run-time well and showed many creative ideas that had me smiling and amazed. The CGI was a bit not smooth at times, but it was still good considering the technology at the time. 

The main trio was also introduced, and their dynamic was also entertaining. I especially liked Emma Watson's character the most. She was clever, talkative, and quirky. And because of her confidence she didn't get too many friends, which was sad, but she's in the trio now. 

Since I enjoyed the magical world a lot, I honestly didn't care much about the main story of this movie. Even though there's a twist that was unexpected, I still didn't feel much about it. This movie's primary objective was clearly to introduce Harry Potter and the world he just stepped into, so the main story wasn't focused on as much. 

Overall, an entertaining and fun movie. Go Gryffindor! 7.5/10"
No Name,4.5,"Wow. Just wow. This movie absolutely blew me away. I didn't have too many expectations for this movie, but when I watched it, I just was captivated at how accurate it was to the book, yet felt like its own thing at the same time. An absolute must see."
No Name,4,"With a considerable length of time, the film manages to develop many characters very well, as well as being fun."
No Name,5,Simply enchantingly wonderful.
No Name,2,This movie is the worst film of the seven Harry Potters. There is not a lot of action in the film except in the last 30 minutes because they find the Sorcerer's Stone.
No Name,3.5,"Delightful tale of magic and childhood. Surprisingly as quality as you remember, and the director created a look and feel that held consistent for a near decade long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was able to, even if it isn't quite as ambitious"
No Name,3.5,"I think its a lovely movie, though its the one most intended for kids from all of the HP movies. Still is quite enjoyable, at least if you are into HP, as it brings so many memories. Emma Watson's perfomance is absolutely bonkers, even more so if you consider that back then she didn't have any experience other than school plays"
No Name,3.5,"Separated by 20 years from first seeing this in the cinema, and by more years from over-familiarity with the book, this is much more fun than I remember it being at the time. It has all the joy, magic and wonder it needs, and the plot no longer feels like it's on rails in a slavish fidelity to the book. It doesn't need to be this long, but it works well ... not least due to the near-faultless casting which, as well as ensuring the film meets its mark sets the whole series up for success."
No Name,4,"I love Harry Potter since I was a little child, and this movie started it all. Not the best in the saga, but an amazing introduction to the wizarding world."
No Name,5,"This movie is super nostalgic. So good, and the visual effects are amazing"
No Name,3.5,"Full of childlike wonder, a solid introduction into the world of Harry Potter."
No Name,5,"I think I may sound like a stooge if I say this, but it is now that I have finally watched this movie. Throughout my life - school days, college, internet; I often used to see people going non-stop about Harry Potter (I think they are called Potterheads). Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that. So finally yesterday I decided to give it a try and oh my god, it's amazing! Why didn't I see it back when I had the chance to?
It is kinda unbelieveable that such a nicely detailed CGI movie was released in 2001. I know the VFX had grown a lot better since Lord of the Rings trilogy was also made at the same time, but still I was not prepared for it. I was expecting it to be just some regular CGI that didn't age too well. Trust me, if you haven't watched the movie till now, it hasn't aged at all. It can very much still be the selling point of the movie.
I had watched some parts of the movie, like the beginning where Harry's cousin was brought back home after he fell in the snake's cage and the Quidditch scene, but I didn't have any powerful memory of any other scene from the movie. In the scene where Voldemort says to the professor, ""Kill him!"" somehow I used to remember that scene to be the teacher first saying ""What should I do?"" to which Voldemort replies that. And I'm glad I didn't have any previous memory of this movie, because that way I was able to experience everything for the first time.
This movie has the 2001 movie's vibe to it, where the story is very straightforward and the childish background music makes it seem very easy to understand. I haven't seen any other movie of the franchise, as I'm going to watch the next part after writing this review. But I hope it stays that way, since it's very easy to understand and thus I can watch the movie on my phone while doing my work on my laptop."
No Name,4,The first movie of one of the most known sagas of all time. Fun and enjoyable respecting is source material.
No Name,5,"I really enjoyed the film, i suggest it."
No Name,5,"Harry Potter and The sorcerer's stone, It is a movie the first film series Adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's popular children's novels about Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. He is summoned from his life as an unwanted child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards. There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths.  This movie I watched it for the first time as a kid. For me, this movie is a very simple film, with a plot that can be found in most of the movies on the market. But with the fact that it was one of the first movies in that era that was a story about the magic world It made me, both childhood and now, that even though I was able to guess the events of the story, the movie was able to find a point where we were very excited, entertained, and passionate about this magical adventure. this magical world It is an amazing movie for me. It helps create my imagination. I love this movie so much In my view, the film is perfectly flawless, telling the story of the growth of the characters. Made me feel growing up with them. I am delighted that people have been able to create such a creative and fun novel."
No Name,5,"Classic, love watching it"
No Name,4.5,"Il primo atto di una delle saghe più famose del cinema è un'inno alla meraviglia; dopo i primi minuti di presentazione dei personaggi e di introduzione alla storia, ci si getta in un mondo meraviglioso, costruito con grande eleganza, in cui per 2 ore si scoprono tutti gli aspetti fantastici del castello e dei suoi dintorni.
Dai quadri in movimento agli animali fantastici, dai fantasmi quidditch; tutto viene scoperto e getta le basi per entrare nel dettaglio dell'incredibile storia dei capitoli successivi.
Peccato forse per qualche personaggio leggermente troppo piatto (anche a causa della giovane età dei personaggi) e di un finale non all'altezza del resto del film."
No Name,5,hint: snape kills dumbledore
No Name,5,"The negative reviews I read about this movie come off like they were desperately seeking a way to be a contrarian in the face of an overwhelmingly satisfying viewing experience. There has scarcely been a better movie whose purpose was worldbuilding - other movies would have hedged their bets about whether there would be a sequel or not, whereas there was almost zero chance this one wouldn't. The did such a tremendous job that the actual plot points for foiling Voldemort were handled at an absolute sprint - they spent perhaps 90 seconds dealing with the Devil's Snare, for example. It wouldn't have been reasonable to ask for a longer movie than this as it was already clocking in at 2.5 hours, and thus the job they did juggling tons of exposition with an exciting plot was beyond reproach. The child actors did a wonderful job and it seems like sheer luck that they grew up to be attractive, talented young adults as the series progressed. Hedwig's Theme from Williams's score is my favorite piece of film music of all time and it wasn't even remotely overbearing at any point. Endlessly rewatchable. Kudos!"
No Name,4,"This film was good, I think they did a great job in introducing the magical world to cinema and I think the cast is perfect. Throughout the film I felt a lot of intrigue to continue knowing what was happening and I believe that the director was right in that, since he keeps the public very close to the screen. It should be noted that the script of this film is great as well as the visual effects, which for the time are quite good."
No Name,5,Ossum film it's just a masterpiece one of the best movies in harry potter series I love it. Witchcraft films are best
No Name,4.5,"This franchise will entertain me for the rest of my life, it doesn't get boring nor childish. I love this film, it's a very captivating story and a gift from the Brits. My favourite part about this film in particular is to see Hermione's brilliance from year one, and how little the actors were - we've grown up together."
No Name,5,"Great,they released the full potential of the story line.Brilliant start for the movies.Also very good to meet the characters and understand how things work at Hogwarts."
No Name,5,The best USA script ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Name,4,Great start to a great franchise.
No Name,5,Absolutely love this movie. Very entertaining.
No Name,4.5,"I am not too huge into Harry Potter, but this is a fun and action-packed film."
No Name,5,OH MY GOSH! I always read the books first because of the great detail but this portrays EVERYTHING important. I love the Harry Potter series and I love that this movie makes the first visits to the magical world so spectactular. This is seriously such a good movie and it deserves more awards. The book was amazing as well and the movie really brought it into reality. I applaud everyone who worked on set.
No Name,3,I'm not a massive fan of these Franchise like most people but I still enjoy the movies. this is one of my least favs because the kids are so young and they're not that good at acting.
No Name,4,"Why didn't harold trainspotter use time travel and kill voldemort?  Or why didn't Quirel 
just shoot harry anus with a AK-47, why didn't everybody use a glock?"
No Name,5,"Muito top! Quem ainda não assistiu não sabe o que tá perdendo haha, amo esse mundo mágico"
No Name,1.5,Meh. It wasn't that good. I even found the first book kind of boring. So the movie can only be worse.
No Name,4,pretty good initiative for fantasy movies
No Name,4,"This movie was amazing. The actors were impressive, considering they were kids themselves. I liked how they didn't use older kids to fill the roles. The plot was lackluster and there was almost no character development, but the portrayal of the Harry Potter world (especially Hogwarts!!) was fantastic."
No Name,4,"Great! lost a star bc it's not ""Philosopher's stone"""
No Name,5,The movie that starts up the franchise!!! The magic begins!!!!!!
No Name,4.5,"I wish Rotten tomatoes was out for 10 instead of 5, because if I were to rank this out of 10 it would be a 8.5 but since it's out of 5 I'm giving it a 4.5. This is very very well done other than some minor details the only thing I had an issue with was the fact the movie is letting the twist at the end be known throughout the film if the viewer is actually paying attention."
No Name,5,The first one is usually is the best! And they did a good job with the cast.
No Name,4,"Ottimo film diretto da Chris Columbus, che riesce a trasmettere un'atmosfera molto puerile e per bambini così come traspariva dalle pagine del romanzo originale.
Anche un film di buon intrattenimento, un gran film come esordio della saga che è riuscito a spronare gli spettatori a recarsi nuovamente al cinema per la visione dei sequel."
No Name,4,"Just as a preface, I read all the books before watching the movies. After reading them back in 2012 (and rereading them multiple time), Harry potter is probably my favorite franchise to date (both the books and the movies). The books are perfection, so it makes it very hard for me not to view these films as a fan of the books, but as a fan of modern cinema.  I have watched the movies in the past, and decided to rewatch the series for old times sake. The sorcerers stone is a solid opener to the series. It does a great job at establishing the world, the characters, etc. It is just a fun, mostly happy childhood movie that creates that emoptional connection between viewer and the universe. If you are watching this series for the first time, you will love this movie. However, as someone who has seen these films before and knows the ins and outs of the universe, this first movie is a bit slow at times; struggling from pacing issues. Some of the effects have aged pretty poorly, and the cinematography is quite bland. With all that said, still a dope opener to the best saga ever!"
No Name,3.5,The starter the original. A fun child film that still holds up
No Name,5,"The target for this movie is pre-teen, and it nails it in every scene, start to finish.  Illogical?  Yes, lots of silly stuff. But all perfectly fullfilling the intent: a confusing and seemingly arbitrary adult world in which the kids emerge as heroes."
No Name,4.5,Great movie and a great start to a great franchise!
No Name,3.5,"An admirable adaptation of a charming first chapter. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won't break any bones, but succeeds by way of its whimsical world-building, multi-demographically layered storytelling, spellbinding cast and insurmountable amount of heart --- making it a delightful diversion for the entire family!
Iroh's grade: B-"
No Name,5,"Just like the first book, the movie has outstanding action and emotion. A great movie for the whole family!"
No Name,4.5,"I loved it as an 11 years old kid when I first saw it on the big screen and it still remains one of the best chapters of the saga. Columbus' direction captures the atmosphere of the book and creates a solid, homogeneous background for the first adventures of the trio. While clearly intended for a young audience, the movie is still worth many nostalgic rewatches thanks to its all-star cast and special effects which are still impressive today. Some sequences, like the chess game and the Mirror of Erised, are even better than in the book."
No Name,5,"one of the best movies of all time in my opinion, also one of the best series of all time in my opinion"
No Name,4.5,The majority of the film stayed true to the book and the cast was well chosen. Hogwarts is amazing.
Piano_Rob,5,This is a classic now! Everything about it is wonderful!
No Name,5,I grew up to this movie and I will always love Harry Potter!!!
No Name,3.5,"The first Harry Potter movie does a great job at setting the universe and characters of its story. Performances are generally solid- Rickman stands out as the best performer in my opinion. The twist with Snape/Quirrell is well executed and although the CGI often looks dated it remains a fun, light adventure"
No Name,4,Going back in time to see little Harry and his friends -- and enemies -- was a real treat almost 20 years later. I was not looking forward to the Harry Potter Reunion Party until I got there and now I don't want to leave.
No Name,4,"Special Effects: 0,5/Sound Effects: 1,0/Acting: 1,0/Story: 1,5"
No Name,5,"Amazing movie!!
Totally worth watching!!"
No Name,5,this movie made me want to cry how good they showed it specifically maybe citing charity i watched this the other day on dvd and had a lot of fun hogwarts and all the harry potter universe big crush on hermoine i remember when this movie came out i was in high school and luckily got into a great school and thought of this with the visuals like the dining hall for example i can't begin to state how much fun i had at school the dvd i had i had gotten from a thrift store there's so much good in this movie franchise may favorite part probably being the campus but also when he returns home is nice too his family though trying to break the habit of just saying somethings good and rather try to explain what makes it good or other better connoisseurial reviewing to get as good as ciskel and ebert
No Name,3,For me the movie was a nice beginning to the franchise but it was slow at parts. The special effects a fine for the time it came out but looked a little weird at parts. The actors all did great.
No Name,4,"I highly recommend it,"
Kieta,5,Great for my 8 year old whom never seen it
No Name,4.5,"The Sorcerer's Stone is a near masterpiece as far as adapting the characters the feel and atmosphere and adapting J.K Rowling's truly magical, tranporting story of a boy wizard discovering he is in fact a wizard. The casting was argubly some of the greatest casting decisions ever made in any franchise movie to date. The chemistry from Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson was of the utmost crucial essence and the single most important aspect of the entire production and they 100% got it perfect. Some of the visuals look dated but only a mild compliant."
Stefanie K,5,SOOO much fun seeing this in the theater!  These are some of my favorite movies.  So well done and the cast is PERFECT!
No Name,5,"There's nothing like the first
There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.

Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!

Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?

First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie"
No Name,5,"Harry Potter is one of my favorite franchises of all time. Huge fan. This one started it all based on the famous book by JK Rowling. The film gorgeously directed by Chris Columbus of Home Alone fame boasts an incredible cast of veteran British thespians including Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, the late Alan Rickman, and John Hurt. But this movie would not work without the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione played respectively by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Here at the beginning of their careers as children they carry this movie from beginning to end and their chemistry makes for one of the most memorable trios in cinema. The script manages to tell the story in a reasonable amount of time given the amount of set up. The special effects are really an incredible achievement and transports us into a fantasy world that feels grounded. The creatures, props, and sets bring Harry's world to life in a way never before seen in movies. Finally, the score by the legend John Williams is perhaps one of the most beautiful and joyful scores ever and has reached iconic status. This film is a masterpiece filled with imagination and wonder that left an entire generation including me in love with Harry Potter"
No Name,5,Very cool and magical
No Name,2.5,"The whole movie feels very disjointed. It subtly hints at the storyline scene after scene, the plot thickening as you go through, but for the most part... it feels like just one scene after another. It's not a bad movie by any means, but probably my least favorite of the franchise. The acting isn't great either. It's fun. This isn't the fault of the book either. The movie just doesn't quite capture the magic and engagement either. After sitting through mediocre acting and just class after class, it kind of pulls you out of the movie. The Lord of the Rings movies took the masterful books and turn it into visual works of art. The movies are classics. The Harry Potter movies are just... fun. They slowly get better and better. Although the Harry Potter movies are quite possibly MORE enjoyable."
jessie,5,good movie. But book is better.
Armando,5,Always a classic. Loved it completely.
No Name,4,The cultural phenomenon starts off with a beautiful introduction to the characters we will stay with for a decade of films.
No Name,5,Film is a great introduction to the universe & is faithful to the source material
No Name,2,"I surprisingly found this movie underwhelming. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not that good with its effects, story, or even basic child acting (which wouldn't typically be a problem if all the main characters weren't kids), but the worst thing it is guilty of being is generally uninteresting, which thankfully is something the series would improve on going forward."
No Name,3.5,"Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone is another well made production, from good set pieces, magical costumes, imaginative score, impressive visuals, and enjoyable young actors/actresses. The only problem that this movie has, is that some characters spill out exposition, and we are supposed to keep in contact with all this info that is scattered around this 2hr. 30 minute movie, and it kind get a bit tiring after a while. So 7/10, it's hard to poke holes at this movie."
No Name,3.5,"This first Harry Potter movie was pretty good. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. The plot of the movie was thrilling, dramatic, and entertaining. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. See this one first before you see the other movies."
No Name,4,Delightful and the only actual children's movie of the bunch.
No Name,3,"A great introduction to the Wizarding World, but I just can't get past it's childish atmosphere and lack of plot."
Andres,5,Absolutely wonderful. Totally different experience in the theaters. Loved seeing certain scenes and remember my time at universal
No Name,3.5,"An honest recreation of a fantastic book. It shows its age and its demographic on its sleeve, but the film is faithful to the source material, and really enjoys inviting viewers into its extremely unique world. This is basically a classic at this point, and is must watch material, especially for younger audiences or those needing a nostalgic trip."
Chris,5,Excellent magical movie! The music is captivating!
No Name,3,"The Harry Potter as a franchise is brilliant, but this movie is probably the worst in my opinion.
The acting is not very good, poor character development, director made good job but I think it could be way better."
No Name,5,"An excellent adaptation of the popular book. Visually, musically, and storywise this is a must see."
No Name,4.5,"I thought this was a great way to start the ""Harry Potter"" series, I really liked this film a lot."
Lee,4.5,Excellent family film.
No Name,5,Absolutely pure magic film.
Stephany R,5,I felt safe returning to the movies and loved seeing this movie again on the big screen.
Susan H,5,So fun to see Harry Potter on the big screen.
kimberly,5,Loved seeing Harry Potter on the big screen!
No Name,4.5,"This movie was great, CGI was fine, there were a lot of characters and that's what I loved about it before it was released it was already a big movie, perfect movie and franchise."
No Name,4.5,It's encompasses everything you would want in a children's fantasy movie!
No Name,4,One of the few movies in the series that takes full advantage of the magical qualities and quidditch scenes that make the spectacle as advertised.
No Name,5,"This really is one of the greatest films ever made. Not only does it start an unforgettable franchise but it also creates an atmosphere no other film has been able to create,the film is perfectly casted with a solid artistic direction, and it reinvented the YA franchise .  A MUST SEE"
No Name,4,"A great start with an amazing cast, great memorable characters, funny moments, a pretty decent plot, a great quidditch scene, a well built up villain, some cheesy effects, the final fight scene is honestly class and the movie's got a beautiful score from the man himself John Williams."
No Name,4,"A great, memorable and classic kickoff to the franchise."
No Name,4.5,"It adapts its iconic source material in an effective way, it condenses its extensive narrative in an entertaining and charming story, with an excellent ensemble cast and impressive visuals for its time."
No Name,4,Great adaptation of the book & a very good beginning to the franchise
No Name,3.5,A great start to a phenomenal franchise. But the younger attitude and milder tone of the first two films might turn some away. But great fxs and fantastic set design bring the magic out in this first installment!
No Name,0.5,Not a magic guy and its not interesting
No Name,4,Damn right exciting. An absolute marvelous adaptation of the harry potter books that would spanned into the next great coming films!
No Name,3.5,"Well made, perfectly cast and sure to be fun for the entire family."
No Name,3.5,"A reasonably strong first entry into JK Rowling's smash-hit series, Sorcerer's Stone manages to capture the essence of the book, and streamline the many details and plot points of its magical world into an entertaining adventure. However, the movie's dedication to maintaining it's faithfullness to the book is at times also it's weakness, where it can feel bogged down. Some sequences do not lend themselves to the screen so well, and might be better left out for a more even-pace. Still, this movie represents a strong first chapter that will please both hardcore book fans and first-time Harry Potter viewers alike."
No Name,3.5,"The Harry Potter novels were a huge component in the scaffolding that formed my creativity. At the time that these films began to be released I was deep into the fandom, unable to be objective. To fully own up to it I was a hater of these films, constantly looking for issues and unwilling to give them an inch of credibility. Recently my niece asked me about them, and when she discovered that I had stopped part way through the film universe asked me to watch them with her. This will be my second viewing of the first four movies though nearly two decades have passed since I last saw the Philosopher's Stone (I refuse to recognize the bastardized title). It will be my first time experiencing the final four pictures.

The opening sequences of the Philosopher's Stone were charming albeit in a disturbing fashion. The abuse young Harry suffers at the hands of the Dursley's feels bizarre when viewed through a PG prism. Though the creative team does a great job bringing Rowling's magical world to life, which kind of sadly quickly takes your mind off the darker elements. Outside of Radcliff the cast does an incredible job embodying these iconic characters

While I don't think I'll ever be able to separate the films from their incredible counterparts, I did myself a disservice all those years ago. I'm excited to make up for lost time."
No Name,4.5,"This was a great way to start the ""Harry Potter"" series, I really liked this film a lot."
No Name,3,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, directed by Chris Columbus, was a wonderful, wizardly time! Knowing Chris Columbus from Home Alone, I was a little skeptical going into this film, but he put his intuitive style all over it, shooting a real dazzling looking film.

The overall concept of the film is outrageously original, filled with tremendous potential and heart, with many memorable scenes! The premise of the film is where the issues come in. The premise is fine, and good kickstart for this favorable series, but it wasn't focused, or fleshed out nearly enough; All the creative team cared about was setting up all this exposition. The exposition is fine to a certain extent, but when seventy percent of the film is exposition, with another fifteen percent being some fan service-filler scenes, it makes it hard to get invested into what's going on, at this point in time. If the creative team cut out most of their filler scenes, they could've tightened up the narrative more, while giving the film an easier run time to digest. The film had a pretty decent pace for more than sixty percent of the film, but the middle act became more of a slowburn pace, creating a few unnecessary plots, that just got left to die.

I give so much credit to these casting directors, for casting this star-studded cast! With this film being filled with a lot of characters, the creative team did a good job of balancing everyone, crafting countless memorable character moments, while giving them some nice layers to start to develop. It's no secret to say that the three main wizards in, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, are the selling point to this film! Almost automatically, they're given phenomenal chemistry, and banter to play around with. They have this pure motivation, that make them really investable, and easy to root for. Although some of the supporting characters can go underdeveloped, they were still a huge asset to the film, and they all came to play ball!

The screenplay by Steve Kloves was pretty well written overall, besides some of the parts and characters that went underdeveloped. He adapted this nice mythical speech style, that worked really well with the setting and plot! The comedy was really well balanced, and interwoven into this, sometimes darker toned film. Steve Kloves worked really well with J.K. Rowling to craft this script, and they made more than a handful of memorable quotes, that will just stick aroun with you forever!

The creative team created tremendous potential with a new world, that opens doors to endless opportunities! The production design looks absolutely beautiful! The creative team utilized so many great set pieces, while having so many great practical costumes and makeup to go along with this amazing world.

It's understandable that the magic isn't all there yet, but I would've liked a little more, with some conflict, to give the film more risks. Columbus had the perfect opportunity to add a lot of stakes, because of the kids inexperience, but the creative team didn't quite jump on it. One of the bigger issues of the film, is the effects. They weren't terrible at the time, but they don't hold up that well, and the creative team carried themselves like they created seamless work.

The score is one of the biggest success this film has. John Williams is a master composer, and he easily crafted one of the most known scores in cinema! The score adds so much depth and intensity to every scene that it's in!

Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will always have a special place in my heart, but it has room for improvement."

•Interesting build-up

•Daniel Radcliffe (and others)

Cons:Cross mark

•Quidditch sequence is awkward

•Feels largely expository as a whole"
No Name,4,The one that started it all has all the qualities that you’d want in the series starter.
No Name,3,"introduction to harry potter, awesome"
No Name,4,"Me encantó la verdad , no s parece en nada al libro sin embargo te sabe llevar a esa magia. Ame el callejón de dragón. Como se conoce con Draco es más dramático . Entrañable"
No Name,3.5,"This first film in the blockbuster franchise was one of my favorite films growing up, but does it hold up in 2020, or is it blind nostalgia? I'd say it mostly holds up but there are things that I didn't notice when I was younger, it has its issues so let's dissect this film a little bit. Chris Columbus makes such a fun and believable world that you desperately want it to be real, magic is seen as an amazing wonder in this movie and you are pleasantly surprised by it as you discover this whole magical world for the first time with Harry Potter. John Williams' score goes without saying, it is very magical, not just because it makes you truly feel the magic people are using, but because it is so fitting and emotional, he is the greatest cinematic composer of all time and this is one of his absolute best scores. The casting and performances were all perfect, the young leads surprised me and I cared about them, but Alan Rickman as Snape was amazing, I love his character and his presence just makes you feel depressed, this was by far his best role, narrowly beating Hans Gruber. I always enjoy the Dursleys, no matter how cruel they are to Harry, and Richard Griffiths is the most underrated actor in the series. The production design and practical effects are top-notch in quality and it helps make you feel like this world exists with these creatures and the beautiful Hogwarts castle. This film is not without issues though as I have several that I noticed upon rewatch. This film is long and slow, it is drawn out because this needs to do a substantial amount of world-building and it is also an origin story for all three of our leads; I understand why they did this, but they could've taken out maybe ten minutes, or at least replaced it with more plot development, this film definitely drags at times and not a lot of time is devoted to the overall plot or the antagonist of this movie. I did not care about Quirrell at all and thought that he was a wasted character who should've been more important considering he was the main villain, not a lot of time was given to the actual sorcerers stone either, we didn't get to fully understand why it was such a coveted item and it feels more like a half baked sub-plot. The camera at times gives some weird angles and tracking shots which I've never noticed before. The full-body CGI is very noticeable and terrible, especially when compared to the amazing practical effects. Back to the positives though, I really enjoyed the Forbidden Forest sequence, it was dark dreary in tone which was refreshing from this happy go lucky, magic is awesome tone that is present in the rest of the film. Quidditch is by far my favorite thing in the wizarding world and the match in this movie is so exciting and viceral, you really wish that it was real and that you could see the amazing sport in real life. This film was a pretty good start to this epic franchise, though most of its problems have to do with pacing, bad CGI, a weak antagonist, and a main plot that was sidelined during the first half of the film and rushed through in the second half. The great acting from everyone, a decent script, Columbus' sure direction, and great makeup and production design paired along with great performances from our young leads and memorable side characters make this a pretty good movie and a solid start to the franchise."
No Name,3.5,"First time I watched this, I did not like it, but after rewatching it I realized how good it was (7/10)"
No Name,3,"So I finally watched the Harry Potter series and man was it something. Starting off we have the ""Sorcerers Stone"" and while it's not totally forgettable, it does leave a lot to be desired. The kids are charming and the story is pretty fair but everything just felt too ""cute"" for me. And while nobody gave a bad performance, I fount mostly every character besides the big three, (Harry, Hermoine and Ron) Hagrid, and Snape (Alan Rickman) to be mostly forgettable. The CGI isn't bad and the dialogue could've definitely been worse. All in all, this film is fine but it doesn't push the boundary what so ever.


P.S. Hagrid was the best character."
No Name,3.5,"Despite its childish nature, The Sorcerer's Stone serves as a strong introduction to the Harry Potter saga."
No Name,5,"I think this movie was the perfect way to present the beginning of the Harry Potter series. It was adventurous and fun to watch, really enjoyed it and is one of my favorite  movies. Defiantly a must see."
No Name,3.5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone nicely introduces the big world of Harry Potter while adding a plot that will keep audiences interested.
No Name,3.5,"it's good as a preface film, but very childish"
No Name,4.5,I never grew up watching Harry Potter but this movie gave me a sense of nostalgia I didn't know I had. It goes to show what a masterpiece this movie is. A great adaptation of the book and a great way to kick off the franchise!
No Name,5,"I enjoyed the books, i enjoyed the movies !!! Great one"
No Name,4,The Harry Potter film which started them all
No Name,4,"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone, adapts J.k Rowling's novel really well, bringing out the Wizard Universe to the big screen. Great performances by Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson as they lead us through the other chapters of  Rowling's franchise."
No Name,3.5,"It doesn't matter if you seen this movie first or read the book first. Odds are you either became are big fan or interested enough to see this franchise all the way to the end. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and wishing I was apart of the adventure. That is what Harry Potter does. It pulls you into the world and makes you never want to leave it. The first movie is a simple plot but it is enough to make you want more. The movie doesn't hold up as good as it did back then, and I am surprised they haven't tried to up date the effects. Don't go looking for any Oscar worthy performances, but the actors do a good enough job to make you fall in love."
No Name,4.5,"Given that the book is short, this movie does not suffer from content deletion. Other than Peeves the Poltergeist being cut, this film is magical. It brought to life every single thing from the books to a screen. The acting from the main three hasn't reached it's peak at this point, but it does eventually. This film allows your mind to leave your television room and travel to Hogwarts on a grand adventure."
No Name,5,It is honestly so hard to believe that j.k Rowling created this universe all on her own. This is honestly one of the best film series out there.
No Name,5,A perfect introduction to a perfect franchise adapted from a perfect book series.
No Name,5,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a young boy whose parents died when he was an infant. After his parents are killed, he has to move in with his aunt and uncle who hate him. They treat him terribly just because the aunt didn't like his sister for one specific reason. This reason is that Harry's parents are both wizards, meaning that they can use magic and spells and other magical things. A man named Hagrid comes to get Harry so that he can attend Hogwarts, the school of witchcraft and wizardry. This is when Harry finds out that he is a wizard and that there is a normal world and a wizarding world. Harry then attends this school and meets friends and they all have to figure out the mystery behind the sorcerer's stone. 
	I am someone who is very into the Harry Potter series. This movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an excellent movie. It puts mystery, adventure, and fun all into one film. I enjoy how the movie explains the characters backgrounds well. It makes it more interesting that we know that Harry's parents were killed and how they were killed. It also makes the plot more interesting that Harry's aunt and uncle hate him so much and that they keep him being a wizard a secret from him because they don't want him to end up like his aunt's sister, his mom. This brings up another factor of this movie that I appreciate, the character development.
	Throughout the movie, we learn a lot about all of the different characters. We learn about Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley's background. About how he has a huge family, goes to Hogwarts, and is also kind of squeamish, but also brave. We also learn about Harry's enemy, Draco Malfoy. Draco is a very mean and hostile boy that also goes to Hogwarts. He tries to make Harry's life adjustment as bad as he possibly can. This balance of people that are good to Harry and bad to him are what makes the film and its plot more interesting for the viewers, like me, to watch. 
	Another reason to enjoy this movie is because of its setting. The movie starts out in the normal human world. I think this was important to include because it shows how much adjusting Harry Potter had to do when he went to the wizarding world. When he was introduced to the wizarding world you could tell that he was a little overwhelmed in the beginning, but as time went on it became his new home. I think that putting Harry in a wizarding school was a great choice to do. This way, Harry would be forced to learn how to use his wizarding abilities and have to interact with other wizards his age. This all makes the plot amusing and leaves the viewers wanting to keep watching. All in all, I think that this movie has many good features to it which makes me recommend others to watch."
No Name,4,It may not be the best movie and It's not the best Harry Potter movie but I still find myself loving it every time I watch it.
No Name,4,"The best word to describe this movie is magic. Whenever I watch this movie, I get fully sucked in to the Wizarding world of Harry Potter and forget everything, something no other Harry Potter movie did. John Williams's score is simply magnificent and underscores every scene brilliantly, the sets for Hogwarts, Diagon Alley and Gringotts are brilliant, the casting is perfect. Actors like Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and Maggie Smith portrays the characters brilliantly and it adapts the book so well. Every character and location is exactly how I describe it and there are so many great moments like the entire 3rd act, the Quidditch match, the Mirror of Erised scene, our first look at Hogwarts and many more. Chris Columbus put so much passion into this movie. I laughed, I cried, I was scared, it's everything I wanted and it exceeds the already excellent book. The child acting and CGI is not the best however and since the first book is my personal least favorite one, it also has to suffer from not the best source material but this movie will always hold a specual place in my heart (A-)"
No Name,4,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone (as it was released in England) is actually quite a good, zappy, magical film that will keep you entertained throughout. No complaints here. The music has a large mystical feel to it too. 

All in all, give it a re-watch some time. Just for fun."
No Name,4,Great introduction to a series that started it all :)
No Name,3.5,"The Potter movie that started it all.

Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.

This film is an introduction to the cultural phenomenon surrounding the Harry Potter universe. With book-to-movie adaptations, there are many things that can go astray. Yet Philosopher's Stone seems to capture the wonderment and childhood terror that makes the series a cross-generational classic.

Also kudos to the actors. Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, et al. gave a stellar performance that charms audiences around the world.

It's a charming firm, lighthearted, and whimsical. There's a ton of world-building that lets audiences' imaginations run wild. The film itself is an impressive watch. Even if the CGI seems a bit dated at some places... but is that a fair critique for a 19 y/o film?

Personally, one complaint I had was how fast time seemed to move in this film. We move from month to month rather disorientingly. But you try compressing a school year in a single 2-hour movie.

The other complaint was based on how things seemed to happen too perfectly for Harry. But I understand that is the book's fault & not the movie's.

3.5/5. Great to watch with family and friends."
No Name,5,"Harry Potter is a brilliant series, and this film is a brilliant introduction to that."
No Name,5,"A charming introduction to the wizarding world of Harry Potter!

Chris Columbus' children's fantasy adventure film Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) is a dreamy fantasy picture that will make you want to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I loved growing up with these movies as a child, now as an adult, I appreciate their delightful filmmaking and storytelling all the more. Richard Francis-Bruce edits this movie with such a natural pace that time flies by with a new quaint scenario of magic every scene. Columbus set a new standard for family entertainment by creating all this cinematic iconography with his greatest film: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. It is pure joy for 152 magical minutes of childhood nostalgia.

J. K. Rowling's writing is like stepping into the magical fantasy world of wizards and witches that we all dreamed of casting spells and going to far away places. She understands the perspective of children desiring more from life, whether she writes about family, friends, love, adventure, travel, or courage in the face of adversity. Rowling invented an entire magical universe all her own that I'm forever grateful for her mind. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a delightful family movie that remains a personal favorite of mine to this day.

Harry Potter famously found the most talented child actors around with natural performances, nice chemistry, and genuinely heartfelt emotions. Daniel Radcliffe is incredibly sympathetic and likable as the eager, yet shy Harry Potter. Rupert Grint is hilarious as the endearing poor fool Ron Weasley. Emma Watson was born to play Hermione Granger with her quick wits and adorable charm. She plays Hermione more smug initially until she warms up to the boys and their adventurous spirit. Tom Felton is perfectly cast as the villainous bully Draco Malfoy. His name even means bad guy, so you know Felton had this in the bag with his smug face and elitist attitude as Draco. He lets you know Malfoy is wealthy and comes from a long line of money and isn't afraid to cheat his way to the top. He's a phenomenally hateable antagonist and memorable character.

Richard Harris is so kind and gentle as the formidable wizard headmaster Albus Dumbledore in all his flowing robes and magnificent beard. He sounds so soothing and knowledgeable that I think Harris' serene and kindly Dumbledore is my favorite incarnation of J. K. Rowling's iconic wizard character. Maggie Smith is gleefully stern as the brilliant witch Minerva McGonagall. Harry Potter is simply her best acting. Robbie Coltrane is hilarious and sweet as the lovable giant Rubeus Hagrid. Alan Rickman is phenomenal as Severus Snape with his wicked wit and morbidly serious tone. Rickman is so fun as Professor Snape because of the look of disdain he puts on so well. Richard Griffiths is very fun as Harry Potter's mean uncle Vernon Dursley alongside Fiona Shaw's wicked Aunt Petunia Dursley. Ian Hart is interesting as the timid and stuttering Professor Quirrell.

I must mention the legendary actor Sir John Hurt cameos as the nice wand merchant Garrick Ollivander in the most mystifying scene in Harry Potter when Harry chooses his wand. Hurt captures an air of mystery and warmth that you will believe in magic!

Other excellent supporting roles of note are David Bradley as the sadistic groundskeeper Mr. Filch with his cute cat Mrs. Norris. Matthew Lewis as the cowardly Neville Longbottom. Warwick Davis as the bank teller goblin and Filius Flitwick. Verne Troyer as Griphook is scary and neat. Harry Melling is such a jerk as Dudley Dursley. John Cleese is funny as Nearly Headless Nick like Julie Walters is kind as Ron's mother Molly Weasley. You can even see a cute young Bonnie Wright as Ron's little sister Ginny Weasley at the train station!

Chris Columbus' charming direction is what makes Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone so charming. You want to visit these magical places in an enchanted English countryside as it all looks real. The production design is mysterious, dusty, warm, and quaintly inviting. The practical effects are mixed carefully with excellent for the era CGI, where a talking snake looks real as does many magic spells. The only green screen that's noticeable is the backgrounds while students fly on brooms and the troll. Even the sorting hat still looks cool.

Judianna Makovsky and Graham Churchyard's costumes are already iconic from Dumbledore's robes, Snape's suit and cloak, to the Gryffindor scarves. Clare Le Vesconte's make-up is inspired with crazy choices for goblins and wizards alike. John Williams' score is so pleasant that you can never forget his theme songs for Harry Potter. He carefully composed each piece for each scene as the notes are cues for particular moments on screen for magical emphasis. He outdid himself with one of his most beloved and memorable scores within his illustrious career as a composer.

Columbus brings his usual Christmas spirit and child's playful attitude alongside his resplendent directorial choices. The scary sequences are dark and mysterious, while various payoffs are cleverly established earlier up with clever framing and sequencing on his part. His swift and imaginative direction transcends time and age as he crafted a wonderful feature for all ages. John Seale's striking cinematography captures wide shots of Hogwarts castle, dark foggy forests, hidden chambers, and brightly lit halls with equal grace. Seale's close-ups are iconic and very expressive.

In conclusion, Chris Columbus directed a classic film with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with his creative direction, Williams' legendary score, and a cool cast of talented kids."
No Name,5,I always refused to watch Harry Potter despite my family all telling me its good and that they thought I'd like it but when I finally watched the first one I instantly felt the need to watch the others this is the movie thats one of the best in the series as its the first one so its the one that first gets you attached before watching the others
No Name,5,I may have misjudged Harry Potter...

This movie soundtrack is misterious. It has lots of adventures hard to manage."
No Name,4.5,"Well you described it best tomatoes, AMAZING, this film is a fresh start to this saga, it's delivers what it's supposed to deliver, and way more, it doesn't have very good acting with the exception of course of characters like Alan Rickman, but the story, THE STORY, it's gives us a fresh introduction to the Wizarding World, and it manages to be as good as the book itself, fantastic"

Rhiannon,5,I've never seen Harry Potter until this day. Its such a great movie! I can't wait to see the others for the first time as well
Lexy,5,One of my all-time faves
No Name,4.5,"Uma das melhores adaptações já feitas!

É impossível, para um fan, não se emocionar nesse filme. Se você leu o livro, sabe do que estou falando. A adaptação respeita a obra original e tenta ser fidedigna as possible. Inclusive, talvez esse seja o filme mais fiel de toda a franquia.

A escolha dos atores foi certeira. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson e Rupert Grint formam um trio com uma boa química que funciona. Fora o sotaque britânico que é de apaixonar. Também vale a menção a Richard Harris, que apesar de não ser meu Dumbledore favorito, definitivamente é o mais bem adaptado.

Em quesitos técnicos o filme se torna balanceado. Aqui temos uma OST fantástica, talvez uma das mais conhecidas do planeta terra - e não é por menos. Além de emocionante, marca uma grande presença no filme, que definitivamente não seria o mesmo sem. Quanto aos efeitos especiais, eles deixam a desejar - mesmo pra época -, mas em alguns casos, como na ""projeção"" de Hogwarts, é bem satisfatória. A duração do filme foi muito bem escolhida- não é muito longo a cansar e nem a ponto de se distanciar muito da obra original, mesmo que tenham cortado uma quantidade significativas de coisas do livro. Sendo assim, é obvio que o universo/atmosfera não é tão rica quanto a dos livros, mas isso alguma vez já foi possível?!"
No Name,5,"An adventurous first step into a magical world, combined with Columbus' direction, Kloves' script, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Seale's cinematography, Francis-Bruce's editing, Craig's production design, McMillan's set decoration, Makovsky's costume design, action sequences, sound design and visual effects, Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone serves as a brilliant and visually dazzling adaptation of its source novel."
No Name,4.5,"This classic movie is loyal to the book, and of course the music by williams is amazing."
No Name,5,"The beginning of an eight film saga, this film starts things of right with a world that not only looks magical, but also feels magical. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have excellent chemistry even at their extremely young age in this film. Any moviegoer should give this a shot, as it is swiftly becoming a classic."
No Name,1.5,"I didn't like ""Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone"" because for me it's too supernatural and fantastic I prefer movies which talk about real life. That's why I didn't watch the other movies and I don't really like the saga."
No Name,5,"To bring the Harry Potter books to life is no easy feat, and but this movie does it brilliantly. I realize a few things were left out of the movie but that is understandable. To think they did this great of a job with child actors, too. It's very easy to fall in love with this movie."
No Name,5,you're a wizard harry
No Name,4.5,A great start for Harry Potter
No Name,4,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first movie in an eight part movie series and hooks all ages in the audience as it unfolds with a plot twist from the beginning. This movie starts lifelong friendships you get to watch grow in this movie and in the movies following this one.

No Name,3.5,"The first movie created this magical world perfectly but due to outdated effects and struggled acting and a story far too slow, it's not perfect, 7/10."

No Name,3.5,watched this movie after 18 years. this will forever be a timeless classic.
No Name,2,Harry Potter is so stupid...... in my opinion The Sorcerers Stone just like all of the Harry Potter movies is so slow and boring and just non likable characters.

No Name,3.5,Not magic like the book
No Name,5,"This movie is classic. Even if you haven't read the book yet, this story will catch you. It is a great adaptation of the book and the beginning of a story that despite being magical, deals with topics such as good and evil, moral values, among others."

No Name,4.5,"Review:
‘Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is a fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus.  It is based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling and is the film is the first instalment of the Harry Potter film series.
This movie is so well done, and to me seems like it was ahead of its time. 
Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life. But on his 11th birthday, he learns he's a powerful wizard -- with a place waiting for him at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As he learns to harness his newfound powers with the help of the school's kindly headmaster (Richard Harris), Harry uncovers the truth about his parents' deaths -- and about the villain who's to blame.
I would say that the casting of the film is perfect. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. They steal your heart and every scene they are in. Also, the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane make their characters likable.
Sometimes the visuals are better than others, but it was good for being made in 2001. The film has a big runtime, but the script is so tight it feels like it blows by.
Overall, anyone who loves fantasy films and worlds with great visuals, this film is for you. I go back to this movie all the time, and I highly recommend it.
4.5/5"
No Name,4.5,I think that harry potter and the sorcerers stone is a great film that encapsulates the book well.
No Name,5,I have seen all of the Harry patter Movie they are very good
No Name,3.5,"It's very hard to adapt a children's book into a film, but WB did the job, is the acting abit rough?? Yes, is the CGI at times bad??? Yes but this is the start of a great franchise, this one is probably the one that I less rewatch over again, but that's saying something when you have a franchise like Harry Potter."
No Name,5,Тhis is my childhood...
No Name,5,They do a really good job to make it feel magical
No Name,3.5,"Outstanding film series, very good individually but it becomes top notch when it all wraps up."
No Name,3,una historia increíble donde empieza la magia para el joven potter
No Name,3.5,"While lacking some of the plot depth in the book, this film brings the magic to life with proper character introduction and great action."
No Name,5,I love harry potter so much such an awesome movie!
No Name,4,"Great start, ending could have been better, but it makes you want to watch more"
No Name,5,"A near perfect adaptation of the introduction to a series that grows up along side its main character, Harry Potter. As Harry's understanding of the world gets more complex, so does the works in the series.  One of the best films in the fantasy genre.  This film has a level of comfort that is in part due to all of the incredibly well built sets and amazing music."
No Name,5,"On my way home from a brutal breakup I decided to pop into the local theater to see a movie, any movie. I ended up watching Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. I went in depressed and I left uplifted to the stars! It was the greatest movie going experience I have ever had. Every Christmas Eve I watch this film."
No Name,5,Loved the movie! Loved the cast!
No Name,5,"Loved this movie! It drew me in 100%. It was so compelling, and made the book come alive. So much magic and wonderment!"
No Name,4,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone adapts its source material faithfully while condensing the novel's overstuffed narrative into an involving -- and often downright exciting -- big-screen magical caper.
No Name,5,"Seen it as a kid, I was younger than the characters so I felt like the incredible universe of J.K Rolling was all around me, I've dreamed to receive my Hogwart's admition's letter. I recomand the books, they're even better."
No Name,5,"An immersive experience with an approach that's close as it gets to the first book, the movie got an magical appearance like Golden-Age-Disney-Cartoons"
No Name,3.5,"This is a solid kick-off to the Harry Potter Franchise. There are some fantastic, colorful visuals, and great character introductions. That being said, the special effects are not that great even by 2001 standards. The quidditch match has some very obvious green screen, and the troll is clearly CGI. Also, the child-acting is not the best, so the kids can sometimes come across as a bit annoying. A- 92/100"
No Name,5,"The beginning of a mystical, magical moment in history. This is the movie that had us all looking for our owls from Hogwarts, and disappointed when they never came. The inexperienced cast had so much content to work with, hardly anyone noticed their hesitation on delivering lines. Complex themes pushed the boundaries on the capabilities of a young cast. That being said, loyalty for this fan favorite runs deep and will likely never be overshadowed."
No Name,3.5,Great book adaptation that is true to its source material.
No Name,5,"Still a treat. Radcliffe and company are all kids, but cute kids! The story runs along nicely, and the adults compliment the kids well."
No Name,4,I love the harry potter series
No Name,4,"Perfectly cast, with an amazing set design, the first film in the Harry Potter franchise opens the series with a wonderful start. Every actor plays their role perfectly, and we love every character from the very start. John Williams's score, as to be expected from him, is also perfect in every way. This faithful adaptation of the beloved novel began this series wonderfully."
No Name,5,"Funny, Entertaining."
No Name,4.5,"I hope you get your owls to send your invitation to Hogwarts, because we're about to look at J.K. Rowling's fantasy world come to life at the movies.. by going through a ton of set-ups."
No Name,5,A fabulous start to an amazing series.
No Name,4.5,"The dazzling world of Harry Potter makes its first entry to the big screen with the Sorcerer's Stone. This movie allowed me to truly envision the popular universe created by J.K. Rowling. While this movie was fascinating to watch with the unique setups, it's not a perfect movie. Because of the lengthy and well-developed narrative in Rowling's novel, director Chris Colombus had to minimize the hours of storytelling and thoroughly developed work into a two and a half hour film. It is upsetting that many aspects I loved to read about in the book were not included, or shallowly touched, but we can't have a 12-hour movie, can we? The special effects strewn throughout were fun and creative, especially the quidditch matches! The well popular book series for all ages provides a strong first step as it tries to create the first film."
No Name,4.5,"First iconic chapter of the saga, a movie to see absolutely and suitable for everyone"
No Name,4.5,Would have gotten 5 if Hermione and Harry smashed
No Name,4.5,The Philosopher's Stone is a great film.
No Name,4,"Honestly, the books are better, but I still enjoyed it even if they cut stuff that made plot holes, and I know they have to cut stuff otherwise its too long, but they still created holes they could at least patch with dialogue. If you don't read the books then you'll enjoy the movie more than me but I still liked it."
No Name,5,"Harry Potter starts his film series here with a fabulous first movie, I couldn't have asked for anything better than this!"
No Name,4.5,"I first fell in love with Harry Potter when I was 8 years old. More than just a story of magic, but of courage, friendship, bravery, adventure, and self-discovery. Harry Potter delivers hope and inspiration. And without him, there'd be no magic. Without magic, there'd be no Hogwarts and the Wizarding World."
No Name,3.5,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone marks the beginning of one of the greatest franchises ever- even though it isn't quite as ""great"" as it could be."
No Name,4.5,"It's my favourite film, however I also enjoyed ‘HP and the chamber of secrets'."
No Name,5,"Harry Potter is a fiction and a fantasy film, it has a lot of action and magic, the special effects are incredible! The movie talks about  a boy who has his parents dead by Voldemort, a very powerful wizard and he survived! He was left only with a scar in form of a lightning bolt! Harry discovered  that he is a wizard. The film is PG."
No Name,4.5,"It got everything. Magic, Beasts, Potions, Flying Broomstick etc. This is the movie you can watch every year and it will give you happiness each time."
No Name,2.5,"This is now the 8th time I've seen Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and I can say that I Doesn't hold up as well as I remembered it.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first film in the Harry Potter saga. The film was directed by Chris Columbus who also directed Home Alone. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley.

The acting is good for the most part, but a few of the children actors feel off a lot of the time. Daniel Radcliffe was fine, but he felt like he was phoning it in a lot of the time.

The characters I felt were strong and memorable, but in my opinion I think that Harry Potter is one of the most overrated and annoying characters from successful book/film history.

The cinematography was sound with some very good shots of the characters and scenery.

The settings of the film are quiet strong ranging from a train station to Hogwarts  the famous magical school.

The set design and props I thought were some of the best things within the film from the building designs to the various magical items. 

The costume design and makeup was also strong especially with Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid and Richard Harris as Professor Albus Dumbledore.

The style of the film is sound from the colour scheme to the settings, but I felt that with the budget they could've made it more colourful.

The practical effects from the makeup to the stunts were done well, but the special effects I felt have aged really badly. Some times it would look fine, but at other times the CGI looks so laughably bad.

The film also had some action toward the end which I felt was pulled off quiet well.

The score of the film in my opinion is very strong and memorable. The other music was also good, but not as memorable.

The film also had some comedy which I felt wasn't bad but not good. I only laughed twice within the film and both moments involved Hagrid.

I did have quiet a lot of complaints with the film from some of the rules to the film feeling slow and off at points.

One of the better things within the film was Hagrid. I felt that they used his size very well unlike some other movies with bigger characters. 

The film I enjoyed, but I wouldn't say that I would watch it over most other movies.

Over all I give it a 
5/10

Memorable, but disappointing"
No Name,5,One of my nostalgic movies I love it
No Name,5,What an absolute pleasure to watch! Great movie and and good job at adapting the book to this script! Splendid casting! A magical world to where we feel truly transported!!
No Name,4.5,Wonderful movie that kicks off my favorite movie series of all time and introduces us into the wizarding world of Harry Potter. 4.5/5
No Name,4,"I think, the magical feeling that this movie leaves for young and old should not be underrated."
No Name,4.5,A charming first entry into the saga with young actors on a script the follows the book very well.
No Name,4,"I praised the film for the acting (particularly Radcliffe, Grint, Watson and Hart), villains, plot, music and how it relates to the novel. Though the visual effects werenï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t as good as today, I still enjoyed the visual effects, and the film."
No Name,4.5,"My opinion of the first movie has changed many times over the years. I've always liked it, but found myself comparing it to the other movies which isn't incredibly fair. The effects were good for that time and also contributed to the slightly older feel that Columbus did his best to portray (the movie is supposed to be set in 1991). The cast was excellently selected and I will always stand by that. The dialogue kept me interested, yet sometimes things were stated too obviously. The only part that did not reflect on the book well was the end where they left out a part of the test to get to the Sorcerer's Stone. The acting and plot was very well done overall."
No Name,3.5,The first of the saga is good enough to hook you up and put you in the mood for the second one.
No Name,5,This is such an iconic movie and goes so well with the book.
No Name,5,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
Chris Columbus, who is the director of the movie, has created an incredible and magical adaptation about the record breaking best-selling novel by J.K. Rowling. Is an action, adventure, sci-fi and fantasy movie. 
Despite the fact that the movie has a long length i enjoyed every second of it, this film has an amazing scenery and a lot of magical creatures, it is extremely entertainment, is a masterpiece. In addition, this film involves me in the story, i feel like i was in the movie, it has a lot of drama and is a super original story. 
Other think i liked most is the cast, Daniel Radcliffe who plays as Harry Potter, have an incredible role in the movie, heÂ´s the best person for that character. Another actress iÂ´d like the most was Emma Watson, who is hermione in the movie, is the best model about an excellent student and a really good friend, despite that she is very young in the movie she acts incredible, he is too talented.  
To sum up, i donÂ´t know why i have not seen it before, for me is a five star movie, is my best fantasy adventure movie, it has amazing special effects and a lot of magic, everyone should watch it."
