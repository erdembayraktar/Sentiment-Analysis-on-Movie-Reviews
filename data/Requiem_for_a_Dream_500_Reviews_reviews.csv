No Name,0.5,boring waste of time i dont recommend
No Name,5,God damn... this was one of the best films ive ever seen!
No Name,4.5,"It’s a dark, gritty, and sometimes sad presentation of the side effects of drugs"
No Name,2,"I know it’s a very popular film, and I understand why so many people like it but I just don’t. It’s upsetting because I almost feel as if I didn’t give it a chance. I may return to this one in the future just to see my take on it then, but for now I didn’t care for it. The lady that played Sara Goldfarb gave a magnificent (and I’m not using that term lightly) performance. During her scenes I felt disturbed in a way that could only be described as… cringe? But it wasn’t cringe it was just shocking. Only Saving Private Ryan has gotten that kind of reaction out of me before I saw this. So that tells me I need to rewatch this film some time soon, I think I’ll really enjoy it. Seeing Marlon Wayans in a movie other than scary movie (or just a comedy in general) made me laugh. That’s not to say he didn’t do a good job though, because he definitely did. Jennifer Connelly was just ok, and Jared Leto was decent. 2/5 stars."
No Name,5,this movie is gut wrenching and phenomenal. i’ve never not been able to breathe at the end of a movie because of how off putting it was but the last 20 minutes leading up to it was one of the if not the best ending scene of a movie.
No Name,4.5,"Watched this masterpiece  on Amazon.Consider this as similar to Magnolia or American version of trainspotting. It's dark of course the insecurity of being old resorting to prescription  medication, or younger set with hard drugs.
 Be prepared for the last 20 minutes so.much going on especially the shock treatment part ..A refrigerator  does cast on it and throughout the movie just watch how attention  is paid to the prescription   addicts refrigerator.."
No Name,5,The feeling of lost and ruined life when wrong decisions are made. So sad and heartbreaking. Movie is a masterpiece!
No Name,4,"« Requiem for a Dream » fonctionne grâce à des performances marquantes. La musique renforce la tension, tandis que les couleurs saturées et le montage dynamique illustrent avec brio la chute (la dépendance) des personnages."
No Name,3,"It was a very heavy movie, I like movies like this, but in the end, there were some very ridiculous scenes and unnecessary scenes, but there were quality scenes, I can't say it was a very bad and disgusting movie, but it was very high quality and I can't say it was great either, it had good quality scenes, there were also empty and unnecessary scenes, but the director was really in the movie. He exaggerated things a lot, I can't say it was bad or good, but I can say that it was one of the most beautiful movie soundtracks I have ever seen."
No Name,5,Very good in a disturbing way
No Name,4.5,"Definitely a very strong movie. One of those movies that exceeds expectations, the ending is so tragic, profound and fits perfectly with what was expected. If you haven't seen it, It will depend a lot on the impact that this type of story has on you. But nothing will ever deny that it's beautiful."
No Name,4,Жоский  фильм 8.9/10
No Name,5,"A dark, gritty masterpiece. Darren Aronofsky made a once in a career film with Requiem For a Dream. I've never seen anything quite like it, before or since. It is superbly acted, very well directed and masterfully edited. It takes you places you likely don't want to visit. The good news is, it's just a movie. A movie most definitely worth watching. I highly recommend. 

97/100"
No Name,5,"A character deconstruction of addiction done Altman style that is also an All Time Classic. One of the first things you notice is the creative tour de france of editing techniques. While this is jumpy with no one characer dominating the others, it never feels unfocused, bloated, meandering, or obnoxious with more style than substance. In fact it's got both. The editing really compliments the pacing perfectly and compensates for so many different storylines. It's a very rare case where the editing really makes this work. It uses music video techniques but unlike a lot of others around this time that try that, it doesn't feel dated at all. It comes off as surreal more than anything and really fits with the subject matter. The acting is first rate and really builds as this progresses to the climatic consequences of all the characters actions. Ellen Burstyn is amazing and is the best of all fo them. Even though her story is arguably the most isolated of all four it's not any less fasinating and a real testament to ehr acting ability. It's brutal to watch and fasinating. Shot in a masterfully surreal way that again never feels showy but really amplifies the dazed and confused atmosphere of the subject matter. It's like a comprehensive Apocalypse Now for drug addiction on all sides of the trade. Everyone who has a strong stomach should give this a try once. If your familiar with the director than it helps going in knowing if you can handle it."
No Name,4,"A very intense and rough watch, Requiem for a Dream is one of the most heartbreaking films I've ever seen. It's not just a depressing film, I really felt attached to all of the characters, and that makes it all the more sad what happens to them. This is a film that I found amazing, but that I might not want to go through again."
No Name,3.5,In an intense look into drug use and the effects it can have on your life. The editing is definitely top tier.
No Name,1,dude honestly this is one of the most overrated movies of all time. like wayyyy too much grandma storyline. maybe my expectations were too high bc of how highly ppl regard this movie but i never write reviews either and this one honestly had to be said. wish i didnt waste my time
No Name,5,"If you've been there, this movie will remind you why you left that life behind... Unbelievable film. 5/5"
No Name,3.5,"It's a well-made and captivating movie. But it's not an easy watch. You will leave this movie feeling very uncomfortable and sad. But not in a good way. I felt really icky after watching this movie. Still, the script is incredibly compelling, and it deserves the recognition that it received. However, I kinda wish that I never watched it."
No Name,4,This slow burn will make your skin crawl by the end. It's depiction of 4 people's descent into madness is unsettling and striking to say the least.
No Name,5,Very familiar stories
No Name,5,"Masterpiece, GENIUS. 11/10 I loved this film! However this is traumatic!"
No Name,2.5,"It’s well made from a technical standpoint, but I just can’t endorse this movie's overly disturbing take on the bad that can come from drug use. The characters are one dimensional and merely exist just to be tortured"
No Name,4,"Hard watch, that's for sure. Ellen B and Jared Leto acting phenomenal. Cringey in parts, his arm. Don't think I'll watch it again though, once is enough."
No Name,1,"This really is pretentious to the nth degree. Ellen Burstyn did a great job, i'll give you that. But the film ( sorry movie) is so far up it's own *ss, it doesn't know whether it's coming or going. It's doesn't help that it has Jared Leto in it, because he just adds to the pretentiousness somewwhat. Hard hitting, hard to watch, so can only do once. Come on, it's not that bad! People need to watch Trainspotting. Because it has humour, so when the hard hitting moments come, they make so much more impact."
No Name,5,"Unflinching, hard to watch, though an absolute must-watch, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a gut-wrenchingly horrific look into the dangers of substance abuse that gets its point across a little too well. Phenomenal acting and a powerful script help elevate the movie as well, though it really is the overall message that gets imprinted into your brain. Genuinely one of the most disturbing watches I've seen to date, but an absolutely necessary one to watch at least (and possibly most) once."
No Name,4,"Wow, I kept putting this movie off as I thought it was going to be slow, depressing and hard to get through but I was wrong this movie kept me glued to my seat. I am glad I gave it a try."
No Name,4.5,Reamente perturbadora
No Name,3,"It's not for me but I understand that the actors are so convincing. If you need something disturbing, this is it."
No Name,5,"Absolute cinema! Ele é bem pesado. Consegue te deixar bem desconfortável durante o filme. Vc realmente consegue sentir ele. A música é FENÔMENO, o som é fenômeno, a atuação tbm e aquele jogo de cortes rápidos mostrando o isqueiro borbulhando (fast cuts and close ups) é absurdo!"
No Name,4,I don't know how to describe this movie but my eyes definitely felt it.
No Name,5,My new favorite movie ever. F*ck August Rush
No Name,0.5,A stark glimpse into Leto's future after his cult collapses when he gets picked up for DMing minors.
No Name,3.5,You can truly feel the agony of the characters for 23 hours of their day in search of the feeling in that 24th.
No Name,4.5,"Combining top notch performances (particularly from Ellen Burstyn), strong subject matter, frenetic cinematography and a memorable musical score from Clint Mansell, Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream provides a haunting and intense look into drug addiction, broken dreams, isolation and despair. It's not one for repeated viewing though."
No Name,4,Definitely a hard movie to watch. Depressing but at the same time a great way to get a message across. 7.7/10
No Name,4,"Requiem for a dream is definitely not for everyone, with it's bleak and sorrow nature, however it's worthwhile with it's unique storytelling and message about the horrors of drug addiction"
No Name,5,Never watching this again btw
No Name,4.5,A gut-wrenching & unforgiving tale of substance abuse that will leave an impression on you to say the least. The perfect pacing & clever cinematography only add to the haunting tone of this movie.
No Name,5,So harrowing! Brilliant acting … Jared never fails! I first watched this when it came out and I'm still recovering .. the ending stays with you that's for sure!!
No Name,5,Everyone should watch this so they can really know how illegal drugs can destroy lives.
No Name,4,"I loved the book, and I thought this was an excellent movie.  I'm glad Selby co-wrote the screenplay.  Kids, just say no to drugs and alcohol.  If you want to know why, watch this movie."
No Name,4,"Muito Chocante uma incrível e real jornada diretamente ao submundo das drogas, os atores desaparecem nos seus papéis é um dos melhores filmes que eu vi"
No Name,5,Visually stunning. Awesome cinematography. A harrowing look at the depths that addiction can drag people down to.
No Name,5,"Beware!You will not ever forget this movie, it shows perfectly All the complications of human nature and relationships, but it gives us an insight into the complicated relationship between addiction and love that most of us try to blind ourselves from."
No Name,4.5,The movie is both amazing and disturbing. They've done a really good job at displaying the lives of addicts. It really makes you think about life and I think that everyone has to watch this movie.
No Name,4,"Damn, i feel very sorry now"
No Name,5,"great acting! put jennifer connelly on the map as a serious actor, imo"
No Name,5,"A true masterpiece which should be shown to teenagers as educational material in a fight against drug use. The pacing of the movie is absolutely perfect. Connection with the characters is so good that I've almost felt physical pain at the end of the movie. In fact, the best way to describe the feeling I've got after watching it is - being hit in the face by a brick. It's one of the rare movies which brings you in its world and connects you to the characters, their hopes, dreams and ultimate demise to the point where you feel physical relief after it ends and you get back to your own life. And it's not because the movie is bad - quite the contrary. It's eye opening. It makes you glad to have your own life, in whatever mental, social or financial state you are in. It makes colors of your real world more vibrant. It simply is a requiem for a dream in every sense of that phrase."
No Name,1.5,"Definitely will never understand the hype. I finally watched this and was left thinking, ""Really? This is it?"""
No Name,5,"The score, the pace, the visuals, the camera work, the acting. everything was put together to make of this movie the best movie you will not watch a second time
not because it is bad but because it is that good, that powerful"
No Name,5,"Absolutely incredible with all around amazing performances, a haunting score, and imagery that will stick with you forever."
No Name,5,"It is a film that can come across as disturbing to some people probably but for me it was a really well executed idea, beautiful acting from the main actors and unique but brilliant cinematography. I think some parts of the story could have been worked on or even extended but generally the feeling/atmosphere is one of the best. Was finding myself wanting for more ."
No Name,4,"Unfiltered, disturbing yet powerful, with graphic imagery that doesn't leave the head anytime soon. Phenomenal score, great cast and some neat editing as well as cinematography. I think it's nicely structured, narrated and paced despite it being about four different characters each with their own arc. While there lacks some writing it is still beautifully directed and delivered. Many scenes that were brilliantly crafted to give off the exact essence of the moment but also a few which could have been a bit more worked on. A well executed portrayal of real-life people shown as cinematic as it gets and one that doesn't shy away from ending it all as unfortunate as possible. I thank my dear friend Jeff for this recommendation."
No Name,5,"It's not a normal film; it's an experience. You can't watch it while chilling. It gives a deep, uncut vision of one of the darkest sides of human beings. Nothing for weak nerves."
No Name,5,the last 20-15 minutes of the movie me cry for a good hour afterwards. safe to say i'm never touching drugs in my life holy hell
No Name,4.5,"THERE'S  NOTHING POSITIVE THAT EVER HAPPENS, STILL WORTH WATCHING...IT IS AN IMPORTANT MOVIE."
No Name,4.5,This movie is truly something. I had heard spoilers of the movie scenes and the ending and I still cried when I watched it. One of favourite movies honestly 😙👌
No Name,3.5,Despair without redemption. The subject matter is very dark. The editing & score are irritatingly repetitive yet mesmerizing. The plot is thin with missed opportunities but the unique vision is captured.
No Name,5,"At first the movie doesn't seem like it is going anywhere until it continues to escalate. Eventually reaching one of the best climaxes in cinematic history. It's a very depressing movie, but it will leave you in shock and awe after it is over."
No Name,3,pretty hard to watch disturbing drug movie well acted and shot but its so depressing worth watching once makes you think but some will find it too disturbing.
No Name,4,one of the most uncomfortable movies ive ever watched. wasnt a bad movie ill just never watch it again.
No Name,4,"Failure is a scary thing; everyone fears it one way or another. Requiem for a Dream hones its themes on this, and is greatly enhanced through a talented cast, this is one seriously depressing ride."
No Name,4.5,the camerawork is great，the music is the same
No Name,5,"I love the theme, and I love the cinematography. I think all of the actors did a great job! I've already seen this a few times. I'm not sure why some people say they can only stomach seeing it once. While the film is somewhat dark, I consider it a masterpiece that's worth seeing several times."
No Name,3,"6.0/10- I’m not grading this from a cinematic standpoint, but from a “that was so disturbing you couldn’t pay me to watch it again” standpoint"
No Name,5,The masterpiece of Darren Aronofsky!
No Name,5,"A shattering, mind-altering and utterly immersive psychological drama that doesn't withold, Requiem for a Dream's ravaging intensity, creative imagery and marvelous performances make it a film that positively will stick with you."
No Name,4,"An uncomfortable watch, but a brilliant film."
No Name,4.5,This movie will make you feel incredibly uneasy.
No Name,1,Tough to watch at the end.  Rough depiction of the depths and sinfulness of man.
No Name,5,"Esse filme é incrivel ele consegue nós colocar na pele dos personagem principais é muito bem dirigido os ângulos de câmera são maravilhosos a trama e o roteiro são muito bem escritos, consegue traçar um paralelo com a vida real das pessoas qur sofrem com esse vicios e o seu final é de nos fazer refletir e causar desconforto de tão inpacnatante, um filme que vale a pena assistir."
No Name,5,It's extreme! They are impressive views affected by the same problem. It's amazing what happens from the starting point to the final point.
No Name,3.5,Amazing performance by Ellen Burstyn
No Name,5,One of my favorite movie ever. Addiction is perfectly depicted by main characters slowly turning into monsters.
No Name,5,"All time favorite movie, watched many times. The movie is very sad and while it definitely can seem out of touch with reality. I think the portrayals of the tragedies it focuses are depicted with the seriousness deserved. I appreciated certain creative decisions for example the slang/jive Ty and Harry use while I have never heard the slang words used outside this movie they are easily understood with context clues and give it a timeless feel - movie specific slang shouldn't become outdated so to speak."
No Name,4,"Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is a harrowing look at addiction and obsession.  Sara Goldfarb's (Ellen Burstyn) universe exists primarily within her Brooklyn apartment where, fueled by amphetamines, she obsesses about appearing on television.  Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto), accompanied by his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans), spend their days looking to score their next fix of heroin.  It is a nightmarish vision from the start as the characters slowly but inevitably descend into a world of horrifying physical and mental pain, psychosis, surreal hallucinations, and the reality that there is no escape.  While Aronofsky's outlandish style is sometimes unnecessarily distracting, the movie is buoyed by some stark and memorable imagery, a remarkable score by Aronofsky regular Clint Mansell, and what could just be Burstyn's career-defining performance."
No Name,2.5,"Tasteless, dull junkie mess... What am I watching?"
No Name,5,The best acting performance from Ellen Burstyn! With the best editing ever done in a movie!
No Name,5,A Once in lifetime experience.
No Name,5,"One of the best depictions of addiction ever put to film. Every character is dealing with their own addiciton to something, and it really hammers home that the ones who fall to addiciton often just are victims."
No Name,5,"It was absolutely amazing. Proof that simple problems that create simple plot lines work really well. The soundtrack was one of the most amazing ones I have ever seen in a movie. The acting was amazing as well, and the topic is masterly explored.
It is a movie that doesn't have a single heart-warming moment, and that is perfect considering the dark and raw atmosphere that they were trying (and successfully did) to create.
Drugs can really mess you up, and this movie portrays that in a beautiful way. These four people end up in a worse and darker place by the time everything is said and done. This film takes us to a journey where we can see the addicts going from less to more, going to extreme extents to get their merchandise, and at the same time we are witnesses of their descent to insanity. 
Another thing I want to point out is the photography. OUTSTANDING. The way this movie uses it's cameras is astonishing. Yet again, simple but incredibly effective shots result from this work of art. This movie will raise your tension and feel the desperation from the characters. It will amaze you with its beautiful scenes and unique atmosphere.
It is simple. It is intense. It is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, without a doubt."
No Name,3.5,"Depressing movie, well done but lacking anything pleasant."
No Name,3.5,This...is one heck of a difficult film to review. You won't enjoy yourself. You're not supposed to. Aronofsky is unflinching in driving home the horrors of drug abuse - but his stylish direction distracts from as much as it enhances that goal.
No Name,4,"QUE TRAUMA. Se la recomiendo a todos y no se la recomiendo a nadie. En serio es una película +18 pero no por la violencia o sexualidad, sino por la carga de realidad tan impactante."
No Name,5,One of the best movies ever made in my opinion. Brutally real. An unforgettable watch that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits roll.
No Name,3.5,"A deeply disturbing film -- showing graphically the effect dope has on four people's lives. All four are involved in personal relationships with each other. Dope is the catalyst but the real evil is society -- dreams that are promised and cannot be fulfilled by four inadequate people. Moreover, the way society treats its failures is gut-wrenchingly depicted. Absolutely not for the faint-hearted, not even sure myself whether I benefitted from watching it."
No Name,4.5,"The editing and cinematography of this movie are absolutely riveting, and Aronofsky's direction is truly a work of art. The messages this movie displays are yet to age and the actors are firing on all cilinders. For people saying it's too dark, depressing and has no business existing, go watch Dr. Dolittle 2 for the 98th time!"
No Name,4,"The pace is frenetic.  That put me off at first, but once I caught up with the rhythm I enjoyed the film.  Ellen Burstyn is terrific."
No Name,4.5,"This movie is incredibly disturbing and depressing, however, you will never forget it. Amazing cinematography and artistically thought out plot."
No Name,5,I'm never watching that again
No Name,4.5,"As a young filmmaker this movie left an imprint.  This film made the camera a stylistic element beyond anything that had been done before.  Sure yes,  other great masterpieces of cinema contained great portraits capture in motion, but rarely was the motion used to repeatedly tell the story.   This is where Requiem For A Dream shines, the use of the camera to tell the simplest of stories, one of vice, and pain and fear, and love and joy which barely slipped through our fingers.  Before the main characters have yet to live they are seeking death.  Their parents, and their parents parents doing the same, except not through existential foes, but actual others, looking to submit to existence with slow death.  Not by drugs, but by war, or the misery of the knowledge of what one could have been.  Don't could have been is the story of this movie, summarized by lifes transposed onto drugs and violence.  All the choices of the characters no matter their prior circumstances."
No Name,4.5,This is really a screwed up movie it's kinda sad but it's a great movie. It's all about drugs and how they ruin your life. Well the son is a heroin addict along with his girl and his best friend. And they figure out a way to make money and able to support their habit but in the long run things just get really bad for them. Now one of the dope fiends mother tries to go on a diet and it doesn't work out so she sees a doctor and they put her on uppers. So she can eat as much as she wants and lose weight. And when she starts out taking them they make her feel really good until her body gets immune to them and then she starts craving the high and she becomes a total mess. The whole movie is great but everything gets screwed up
No Name,5,"Really powerful story, definitely one of the most powerful movies out there."
No Name,1.5,"Sad, depressing, gross, on and on. Yes, drugs damage and kill. We know that. What's the point of putting this offensive mess in people's faces? Other than the good acting, this film has no merit and no need to be made."
No Name,4.5,This movie deserved more oscar noms and Ellen Burstyn should’ve won for best actress. This is very disturbing but expertly crafted in a way I hadn’t seen before when I first saw it. It’s a drug movie masterpiece
No Name,3.5,"Highly discomforting, but sharply crafted to portray horrors effectively—it's a masterpiece I never want to see again."
No Name,5,"A work of art! What a beautiful tragic film. Excellent cinematography. Fine, fine cast! I couldn't take my eyes off it. A must watch."
No Name,4,"Not a movie you will watch over a billion times, more of an educational movie dealing with the levels of addiction, mental illnes,s and drug abuse."
No Name,4.5,"In this twisted Aronofsky flick, four individuals pursue love and adoration in various ways. Their changing lifestyles lead them down a rapid road of addiction, crime, insanity, and greed. Aronofsky's examination of the dreadful and long-lasting effects that these can have on human beings is agonizingly thrilling— possibly unendurable for some. Still, the dramatic thriller was executed very well and the acting was efficacious. It's mind-boggling, tragic, graphic, absolutely shuttering, but above all, realistic. I enjoyed the eeriness and the darkness of the film, but it was made to leave a sour taste in our mouths and Darren Aronofsky delivered.

For the bold and disturbed, I recommend you give it a night-watch. For the more squeamish movie-goers and strangers to the psychological thriller genre, I STRONGLY caution… 88%!"
No Name,4,An amazing but unpleasant film to watch.
No Name,5,"crude, a good representation and a roller-coaster of emotions"
No Name,4.5,"Requiem for a dream is a movie that is daring with super crisp clean imagery,impeccable directing with outstanding performances from its cast. It’s a Heartwrenching look at addiction and it makes for some must watch cinema. This is my 2nd arronfsky film and I’m absolutely hooked. Grade A"
No Name,5,"One of the best, most suspensful movies I've ever seen."
No Name,4,"Incredible score. Raw, wrenching look at what addiction does. Funnily enough, I found the mother's story to be the most captivating. The crosscutting at the end, with each character destroying themselves in pursuit of that craving, is really powerful. There are so many cringe-inducing moments in this film because of how unflinching Aronofsky is in depicting these four interconnected tragedies. Not a fun film to watch, but it is a resounding display of filmmaking."
No Name,4,"A great film that pounds home the motif of ""You reap what you sow""."
No Name,3,"The acting was phenomenal. I agree with others it is a difficult watch. I found the storyline to be a bit cliche, very much in line with something we would have been shown in middle school to scare us away from drugs."
No Name,3.5,"While a bit clunky and jarring for a viewer, who can't help get the theme of this movie stuck in one's head? Great acting from Jared Leto and the entire crew and very interesting parallels between the characters for the audience to analyze. It's one of those movies that are good because of how sad and crazy they are!"
No Name,4,"Great movie, perfect to fall in love and see a work of art at the same time."
No Name,4,"This might be one of my favorite ""darker' films of all time. It's hard to watch, but it evokes so many strange emotions. The first time I watched, I was genuinely terrified and so disturbed for days after. But that is why I NEEDS to be watched, especially by younger people. Watch out for that fridge :)"
No Name,1,"Too twisted, too sad, too creepy. Don't watch it if you are not in a mood for something that will give you a sad, bad feeling., It's not a conventional movie..."
No Name,4,"This movie was very detailed in portraying the lifestyle of a drug addict. It was intense and at times hard to watch. But none of it was fiction, it was all too real."
No Name,4.5,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is a total nightmare of the life of its subjects. The rawness of the film is carry out for its montage and powerful performances. 9/10"
No Name,4,"What a great disturbing experience. I cannot express by just seeing the cruelty of the director in all scenes. Just well-directed one of the world's best movies.

The Heart content is in there. It's not for the faint-hearted folks. It's one of the most horrifying psychological thrillers I ever saw. It's cruelly testing all of your nerves in every single part of the film. Awesome watch"
No Name,4,"A shocking and punching movie that you'll never forget. You see the dreams of each and everyone of the characters be canceled by this drug and it absolutely pushes you away from this. It is a really good way to give a life lesson to people of 15-18 that watches this. Never start because you may be like them. The story of the four characters were tragic but you just wanted them to succeed and that is why I love this movie. The story is perfect and the acting makes the movie more watchable. After this, the original soundtrack of this movie is unforgettable, splendid. I just didn't like that much the repetitive use of little sequences before they take drug or something. I don't know how to call it, but it was a bit too much. A really good movie and a must see."
No Name,5,Still one of the best films ever made in my opinion!
No Name,4.5,"Requiem for a Dream is an interesting psychological drama film about drug use. American director Darren Aronofsky successfully portrays the drug addiction of the four protagonists and its consequences on their physical and emotional state. The interpretations of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are remarkable and, in particular, that of Burstyn, who manages to completely fit into her character. The film also features the extensive use of short cuts, split scenes, and very tight close-ups. Finally, the movie soundtrack composed by Clint Mansell, and which includes the famous track Lux Aeterna, is simply extraordinary and is a fundamental component of the film. One of the best movies about drug addiction."
No Name,4,"A visceral and uncomfortable viewing, but not one to be missed. Requiem won’t be for everyone, but it examines an ugly side of human nature and the unfortunate consequences of addiction in a blisteringly chilling way. The performances were excellent and the commitment was real. It’s not a particularly re-watchable film, but it’s a cult classic to add to the list"
No Name,4,This illustrates the devastating nature & consequences of addiction...
No Name,3.5,"An interesting movie that didn't hit me as hard or intense as it may others. The film portrays the descent into addiction of four related but different individuals. While it's supposed to be an emotional and psychological thriller, it didn't necessarily bring out those feelings in me. I felt bad for the characters and their decision making skills but the progression of the story moved too quickly at times for me to build strong connections with those involved. However, the performances are tragically beautiful and the story is tragically bleak. The portrayal of drugs and its effect on the lives of its users and others around them is the central point and in that sense the film succeeds. Nonetheless, this film will hit harder to those who've been affected by the subject matter or have knowledge on the topic."
No Name,4.5,"Requiem for a Dream shows excellent performances twisted in a world of addiction and struggle. It is at times hard to watch but it shows the reality of addiciton with tough scenes and memorable performances. It's a movie you'd probably only watch once, but you will remember it for a long time."
No Name,4.5,"Devastating and heartbreaking performances from Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly complement Aronofsky's intense direction, making Requiem for a Dream hard to forget."
No Name,5,The best drama ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Name,3.5,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is an American psychological drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky in 2000. It is adapted from Hubert Selby Jr. in 1978. The film describes four characters affected by drug addiction and how it changes their physical and emotional states. Their addiction makes them imprisoned in a world of fantasy and despair. As the movie develops, each character will deteriorate and their reality will be replaced by fantasy, leading to disaster.
""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie of four Americans who have fallen from power. They have no bright future but resort to stimulants. When Sara hoped to find a way out of chemical happiness, for her son Harry, his girlfriend Marian and friend Tyrone, she also got used too the pills and even mother Sara Goldfarb fell into a downward spiral. At the beginning of the film, she still tried to guide the child on the right path by tying the TV he wanted to sell to the radiator, but when a rogue nutritionist confessed to a somewhat neurotic sixty-year-old that she might lose weight, because of the pills she didn't want to stop taking them and got addicted.
The movie focuses on the lives of the residents of Coney Island, and the film shows the consequences of addiction and obsession and how obsession leads to addiction. By playing with different camera angles and the smooth editing work, a special film experience is created. Just like the audience has experienced the pain of various characters. 
Jared Leto convincingly plays the role of drug addict Harry Goldfarb, and he will do his best to get the last batch of heroin. But money is a problem. He has no choice but to force his addict girlfriend Marion into prostitution, and the latter is a brilliant role played by Jennifer Connelly. His good friend Tyrone, played by Marlon Wayans, also tried to control his addiction, but his efforts were in vain.
When friends were struggling with addiction, Harry's mother Sara was glued to the tube when she called for contestants on her favorite TV show. She is determined to participate, but needs to lose a few pounds to wear her favorite clothes. Her obsession with television made her addicted to drugs that can speed up the weight loss process. But the result was disastrous, and Sara slowly and surely seemed to lose control of reality. The exorcist actress Ellen Burstyn played a very good role.
""Requiem for a Dream'' is a drama film that makes you think, but also gives you a bad feeling. The film clearly shows how strong an addiction can be. But also how strong an obsession can be and that this can lead to rash choices with disastrous consequences. Requiem for a Dream is, for me, the example of a good film that I never need to see again. It made me quite depressed. With this masterpiece, he impressed me as a viewer."
No Name,3,"This movie has the best music score. The movie shows you how far people can go just to prove that they are something, even though that chase might/will destroy you. Also, we need some limits, otherwise we will lose control."
No Name,4,Perfect atmosphere crafting that matches the story and its ending perfectly. Good portion of this acomplishment belongs to the delicious sondtrack.
No Name,3.5,"Requiem for a dream is not a depressing film as people exclaim it to be but is a film crafted to talk about tragedy highlighting the harsh realities of life. With beautiful visuals that portray important observations, I can't ponder enough about the appropriate score that suits it comfortably. But in the end, the film fails to provide crucial stepping stones for the plot to accelerate."
No Name,4.5,"RATING: A-   Director: Darren Aronofsky 
Requiem for a Dream is a film that's nothing for the faint hearted. The four leads are really good, considering  that the film has only very little minor characters, Ellen Burstyn is definitely the standout right here. The Style and Cinematography are good and they try to do a lot with split screens and pulling the fantastic Score throughout the entire movie. In one sentence, this is a Masterpiece but I'll never ever want to watch it again."
No Name,5,"A Masterpiece that doesn't hold back and doesn't care if the audience is okay with that decision or not. That's what makes it a true legend in the world of film; once seen, unable to be forgotten. A movie that stays with you forever and perhaps was a bit ahead of its time so far as the extreme nature through which its subject matter of addiction and subsequent downward spiral is displayed, resulting in everything from the perfect technical aspects of score to cinematography and editing, all the way up to the acting talent on display from the four leads, who are arguably two leads (Leto and Burstyn) and two supporters (Connelly and Waynes), all of whom could and should have been nominated for their performances, all of whom carried their weight, and when combined resulted in one of the most gut wrenching, unforgettable, real, true, horrific, and polarizing movies of a generation. There's just simply no other movie like Requiem for a Dream."
No Name,3,"I know its well acted, well directed etc, etc but it was such an unpleasant watch that I can't rate this film that high.  Obviously it was supposed to be a downer but I couldn't find any kind of love from the filmaking because it was a slog to watch these characters spiral into the darkest of pits.  Certainly a onetime watch and I'm really only rating it this high because of the technical aspects of Requiem, nothing else."
No Name,4,A movie that depicts the horrific reality of drug addiction with great cinematography . Although due to heavy exaggeration of storyline and poor characterization it lacks in delivery and influence . Though it's scary enough to keep you sober .
No Name,4.5,"An analysis of addiction, an examination of excess and a poem to the uneducated. This film is exactly what it should be to anyone willing to absorb the message. I love this film. 8/10"
No Name,4,"Hard-hitting and gritty with some extremely uncomfortable scenes. However, they all have their part to play in building themes, story, and character. Leto, Burstyn, Connelly, and Wayans all put in excellent performances, with good support from Christopher McDonald. 

Movie Review #1"
No Name,4,"""In the end it's all nice.""

I've put off watching ""Requiem for a Dream"" for forever given the grim subject matter. A recent re-review by Jeremy Jahns motivated me to finally watch it.

And hoo-boy, what a bleak and brutal masterpiece.

It's clearly Darron Aronofsky's best and most compelling work. The acting is phenomenal. The editing, cinematography, and filming style is just amazing and innovative. The way he brings to life four different character arcs such that we care about each and everyone of them shows an artist who is a master at his craft.

For some reason I didn't have the passionate reaction to this as the many fans/critics that absolutely adore the movie. This may be a generational issue.

Trainspotting was more to my personal liking which I think has to do with the soundtrack which for me really elevated it to a more re-watchable film. Trainspotting may have more comedy, but it can get super dark as well (the baby scene).

Ultimately, this is clearly a movie classic that will stand the test of time."
No Name,4.5,"One of the most terrifying films I have ever seen, if not the most terrifying. Requiem of a dream takes a deep unpolished dive into the physical and psychological ramifications of drug abuse. This superb film will leave you in utter despair at even the thought of consuming recreational drugs and is a must watch!"
No Name,4.5,Terrifying. I say it is scarier than a horror movie.
No Name,4,"83%. This movie is a powerful look into the effect of addiction within society, but more importantly ourselves. Yes, we are selfish creatures. Everything, sooner or later, connects back to us, but that is how the movie gets you. On one hand you are deeply saddened for the characters, and more importantly the people who they represent in real life. But on the other hand you see the worst parts of yourself in these characters and realize you must always fight to keep those demons at bay. Aside from the message the movie is unique and is engaging throughout. I can promise you won't be bored, it will make you feel something in someway."
No Name,4.5,"A tasteless, lazy story, wrapped in perfection"
No Name,5,"Requiem For a Dream proves to be a jarring, unflinching, nightmare that never shies away from the bleak, often haunting and never dull saga of drug addiction. The film doesn a fantastic job of really putting the viewers in the scene and the feelings and emotions jump off of the screen, Well acted by the entire cast, expertly directly, and the soundtrack compliments everything in a superb way. Cinematography is superb and this is shot in many unique quick cut montages that become increasingly erratic and disturbing as the characters slip further into the abyss of addiction, finally reaching a fantastic climax that has the viewers heads spinning. Its hard to say what aronofsky's best work is for me its between, The Wrestler, Black Swan, and Requiem For A Dream, I think in the end Requiem remains a moving, sad, overwhelming and above all lasting example of cinema making an audience feel."
No Name,5,"Utterly incredible. Grindingly real, agonising, beautiful."
No Name,4,"Although not for the faint of heart given it's terribly sad subject matter, Requiem for a Dream definitely strikes an emotional chord, introducing us to the problem of addiction in a very dead own manner, and at times making us feel overwhelmed by the pain of the characters."
No Name,5,"It's not an easy film to sit through multiple times, but it's a bleak, haunting masterpiece. This forever made me Aronofsky fan, hell it changed my life pretty profoundly when I saw it 20 years ago, and it still packs a punch!"
No Name,5,Wow this movie is intense! So real! Shows you where drugs and false priorities get you in life. All of the four main characters give out amazing performances! Its one of the best psychological thrillers ever. The editing is something to give credit too. The score is fire! The violins at the end and the beginning are something I added to my playlist.
No Name,5,"I can't say that I ""enjoyed"" this movie, but I cannot deny that it's excellent and well crafted."
No Name,4.5,A very depressing drama that will make you feel like the walls are closing in.
No Name,5,"Literalmente esta película es como si estuvieras dentro de una montaña rusa por una hora y cuarenta, con una edición espectacular, incluyendo una maravillosa cinematografía, con fantásticas actuaciones de los cuatro actores protagonistas, y una maravillosa dirección artística, debes estar preparado antes de ver la película, porque estas a punto de presenciar una de las películas mas intensas que podrás ver en mucho tiempo"
No Name,4.5,one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. But he is good.
No Name,4,"The film is pure-gut punch and at times, genuinely hard to watch. This is the ultimate ""scared straight"" film as their is a realism and genuine sadness to all of the story-lines. The score is perfect."
No Name,4.5,"This is Darren Aronofsky's 2nd movie. So it made sense for him to tackle a subject like this one near the new millennium. It's his trippy spiral into drug addiction. 
Jennifer Connelly, Keith David, a young Jared Leto, and I forgot Marlon Wayans was in this. 3 characters; a young couple and an elderly woman begin to feel the rush but also the downside of taking these supplements. 
20 years later and it's still a highly styled product of its era, its hopped-up editing schemes and plethora of lens choices and gimmicks a glossy refinement of 90s indie aesthetics and Tarantino-patented extremity. Might not be everyone's taste but it's a creative example of a filmmakers vision. The 1978 novel was grimly forensic in detailing the physical and mental destruction wrought by drug addiction. 
The movie also has one of the most memorable scores ever. Wonderful performances and such bleak imagery are impressive. Good cutting edge indie filmmaking with its split screen style and extreme closeups. 
It says we're all vulnerable to some manner of addiction, and legal ones aren't necessarily safer or less ruinous than their underworld counterparts.
The movie vividly evokes the sensation of what drugs actually do to your system, briefly for better and mostly for worse, from twitchy initial rush through to comedown and tortured aftermath. It all boils down to just saying no. Aronofsky pushes his limits with this plot and it's probably a good thing he did setting the bar for future storytellers."
No Name,4,"Difficult to watch but a well-told story and well-made movie. All the main actors do a great job of conveying the slippery slope of drug addiction, even for well-intended reasons. More relevant today with prescription drug addiction on the rise as well as ICE and other drugs. Warning: does not have a happy ending."
No Name,5,"This movie is SAD. The poor mom left all alone and sinking deeper and deeper into the game show she's watching is really the saddest part, but all of it is miserable and it doesn't really get any better at any point. It's definitely a good movie but in a lot of ways it's too real. 10 stars for really hitting home, minus 5 stars for making me too upset to ever watch it again!!!!"
No Name,5,"There comes a time in everyone's life where they are presented with something that fundamentally shifts their outlook on the nature of mankind. This film is one of those examples. To put it simply, this is a movie about the destructive power of drug abuse. But below the surface, Requiem is so much deeper. This is a film about the depravity of humanity. This is a film about the lengths man will go to when their mind is not right. This is a film that will make you question whether there is hope for the future of the human race. The imagery is visceral beyond anything one could describe. It is one thing to have gruesome physical content, but the true power of this masterpiece comes in the outstanding performances of its cast. Anyone who has struggled with their own mind, even in the slightest of ways, can glean something from this work. It is not for the faint of heart. Be warned: this movie will make you depressed."
No Name,4,"This is what you get when very talented people decide to do a semi-realistic picture of the WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME for EVERY character in the movie. William Shakespeare's review of this film would probably read, ""Now THAT'S what I call a Tragedy! EVERYONE we care about either dies or faces a horrible future!""
What makes this movie special is LOVE. We, the audience grow to love these characters. They are presented to us as good people. They love each other. There's not a 'bad' person in the crowd. If Ellen Burstyn was your apartment neighbor you would be glad to say hi to her when you saw her in the hall. The teenage protagonist loves his mother and just wants a great life for her. for himself, for his friend, and for his pretty girlfriend. Everybody just LOVES everybody else!  If they  were selfish arses or just dealing drugs for money, you could think to yourself, ""Well, they got what they deserved!"" 
But the film's characters DIDN'T get what they deserve. They got WORSE than they deserve.
Should your life be ruined forever just for wanting some fun out of life? The mother just wants to be on TV so she can be ""somebody special"" to her friends. Otherwise, without a man, or other interests, she has nothing to live for or look forward to.
I believe that all of us know that life just ain't supposed to be like that. The penalty for stepping over the line shouldn't be what ALL of these characters get.
I can't stop watching this movie. But I have to tell you that I look away from the screen in some parts. I am silently shouting at the screen, ""No! No! That person does not deserve that! Have mercy on them!"" But in this movie, the quality of mercy IS strained."
No Name,5,"This film is hard to watch but gripping at the same time. Every teenager should be forced to watch this, its a fantastic antidrug message."
No Name,3.5,It's an ambitious piece of filmmaking. I admire it for its realistic portrayal of drug addiction
No Name,2,"Aronofsky shows his touch early in his career; it felt like a sort of sequel to ""Pi,"" with much of the same camerawork, four (instead of one) disturbed characters, and a sort of meandering to an ending that is more message than story.  Some of its themes or points are pretty obvious and hit way on the head far too often and too hard; Burstyn's character and story was overly pathetic and not very profound."
No Name,3,"Meh. This is a hard movie to watch, even in 2020."
No Name,4,"Almost twenty years old, I'd heard good things about this but never seen it.  It's been on my list for awhile, finally clicked with a chance to see it.  Starts decent but too much mama boy and his mama drama.  Then it starts turning into some truly terrifying shit and you realize this movie is becoming more and more morbidly entrancing with each minute that passes.  OH MY GOD!

4 of 5"
No Name,3.5,Legitimately almost had a panic attack towards the end of the movie
No Name,3,Ellen Burstyn is one of the best living actresses and her performance is worth the watch even if the film was way too odd for me.
No Name,4.5,"In my opinion, this is Aronofsky's best film, by far. Dark, real, and grim, and featuring a top 3 performance by an actress I've ever seen in Ellen Burstyn."
No Name,4,"Burstyn is an absolute tour de force in this film, what a transformative performance. Every cast member does a strong turn, but she is the unparalleled standout, accompanied by a major surprise in the form of an unexpectedly good performance from Wayans (who I was unaware had performed in any serious dramas at all). The film's notorious intensity was definitely a driving factor preventing me from seeing this film at some point in the previous two decades, but now having seen it I would describe the film more as exceptionally uncomfortable than unpalatable, gradually building up pressure before ultimately allowing the pot to boil over (characteristic of Aronofsky). The film's take on psychological surrealism and induced delusion is great; parents, don't rely on McGruff the Crime Dog to tell your kids not to do drugs, just show them Requiem for a Dream. (4/5)"
No Name,5,"Requiem for a dream is written and directed by Darren Aronofsky based on the book with the same name written by Hurbert Shelby Jr. This film is the story about 4 individual lives and their addictions. One of them played by Ellen Burstyn gets addicted to diet pills when she is invited on a game show and must slim down in order to fit into a dress she so desperately wants to wear and also to look good. Her son played by Jared Leto who is addicted to a lot of things mainly heroine starts up a business with his girlfriend played by Jennifer Connelly and his best friend played by Marlon Wayans where they get drugs and sell it to make profit. And as the year for each individual drug induced person goes on things start getting worse and worse as the drugs take over their health and life. 

Requiem for a Dream is one of those films that will never escape me and for whoever watches the film I guarantee that it won't leave the mind as well. Through this entire runtime my eyes were glued to the screen for beginning, middle and end. Once in a while I'd think to myself man I am really invested in this film. This film garners your attention and never lets up. Which is an aspect that I think people might not like but we'll get to that in a little bit. From the incredible pacing I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and never found myself attention-less. Requiem for a Dream is an phenomenal piece of cinema that will go down in film history as possibly one if not the nightmarish and disturbing films ever created. And it is by far one of the best films that I have ever seen. Now that might seem very daunting because of the subject matter of the film but I don't know. Not thinking about that subject matter there's something very intriguing about this film that I can't not stop thinking about. 

Darren Aronofsky has crafted such a unique and creative tale of misery and sadness that in a way just seems so perfect. The way the story is told and how the editing plays a major part of the film from editor Jay Rabinowitz. Including the shots and cinematography from director Darren Aronofsky and cinematography Matthew Libatique giving the atmosphere of the film its claustrophobic and disturbing experience. From the nightmarish scenes involving their hallucinations to the drugs they take to moments of consequences they have to endear. Also trying not to forget to mention but the fantastic and nerve racking score from Clint Mansell giving the film another bump of adrenaline and absolute menace. This might be my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever and to be far I haven't seen all of his films yet but man I don't think with an experience like this one will be beaten by any of his other films to tell the truth. He did an amazing job at directing this including writing this. It's very unpredictable there was even a moment in the film after I was halfway through it that I decided I can't predict anything out of this film which is something that I really enjoy from a film. You also get why they do this, they're not just stereotypical junkies, they have motives and reasons why they do the drugs. 

Which leave me to the performances from our 4 main characters. Right off the bat I'm debating if I like Jared Leto more in this or in Dallas Buyers Club. He was terrific in this film. Jennifer Connelly is an actress I'd like to watch more of because man she was also fantastic in this film as the girlfriend of Jared Leto's character. Marlon Wayans as Jared Leto's best friend was also really great in the film which I didn't expect at all but he did really well. But my favorite performance throughout this film was Ellen Burstyn. Out of all of them I felt more for her than anyone. But not to say that I didn't really feel bad for anyone else, I most certainly felt bad for everyone but Ellen's performance I felt just more sympathetic for. From the beginning and end you can see the drastic change in her after going to far with the drugs she takes which was just heart breaking. There's also one scene where I just thought this is by far one of the best actress acting scenes I have ever seen ever. She was freaking phenomenal in this film. Now for all of them just mentioning it briefly but there is one sequence that had my mouth in ah and could not look away. A sequence that made me realize what an uplifting experience this entire film has been. 

Coming back to what I mentioned before this film will tear you to pieces with its editing, storytelling and subject matter. Also it's aspect of claustrophobia. And I will be fully understandable if this subject matter is something you or anyone else can't handle. I would never recommend watching this film ever if you feel that way about the subject matter. Trying not to be super dramatic but it's the truth. Darren Aronofsky understands the subject matter and throws his own unique spin on it giving it a very disturbing and very sad experience and is also a film and has also been deemed a film that no one should watch on a second viewing and it's the absolute truth. This is no blockbuster you can watch over and over again and be entertained by, this is a grounded dark tale that will already never leave your mind because of how it is. All in all if you can handle this subject matter I'd watch it for the experience and be done with it.  Or if you're like me you might really like it but who knows. And another thing worth noting is this film is not trying to promote addiction. This is a film that a wanna be junkie will watch and probably will never want to do drugs ever. That's how terrifying this film is. 

Requiem for a Dream is one of the best and one if not the most disturbing and upsetting film I have ever seen in my life and I gonna give it a 10/10. 
Thank you so much for reading look forward to more reviews very soon."
No Name,5,"You don't ""enjoy"" or ""like"" this movie. You honor it as the most effective ""Don't Do Drugs"" campaign ever created. It's not preachy, it's horrifyingly nihilistic. 9/10."
No Name,4,"I have to say about this movie the score is excellent it felt so dark
a fantastic job helping you slide into shoes of these addicts the fact that is so unsettling and so unnerving lend"
No Name,5,"Easily one of the best films ever made. The depiction of the downward spiral through addiction is gripping, heart wrenching, and unrelenting throughout. The cast is incredible, the acting is amazing, and the music adds just the right tone."
No Name,4,"A scary, messed up trip that does a great job highlighting how ""good intentions"" and ""normal people"" can go crazy, humanizing those who are lost. I wish Tyrone's story was a little more fleshed out."
No Name,5,"A disturbing but accurate depiction of drug addiction, that's solidly acted and beautifully filmed, that will leave audiences emotionally wrecked but also satisfied."
No Name,5,"Aronofsky's harsh soul destroying story of addiction centres on four addicts, the widowed Sarah a heartbreaking (Burstyn) her son (leto) his girlfriend (connelly) & there  friend (Wayans) All four characters descend into the abyss of drug addiction with horrifying life threatening results. Unmissable."
No Name,5,"This is the best movie I've ever seen but I will never watch it again. ﻿This is a movie that you can only ever see once. Requiem for a Dream is not a film that you just pop in on any given night. You have to be prepared to watch four characters slowly spin out of control due to drugs.  It's really disturbing but in a good way, it makes the viewer think."
No Name,3,"The cinematic height of a health problematic film that health classes would present as clearly visualized warning about what would drugs do to you is no exaggeration as Darren Aronofsky was headstrong in his disturbingly honest approach that guarantees sickness, to a puking extent if never looked away, and apathy for the hopelessly unlikable characters sealing, or in their cases injecting, their fates from resulted downward spiral of addictions that disregard living. Even though the characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, pathetically disgusting addictions, the cast performed well in getting through especially the young trio building up their stardom at the time. Only one communication found common sense through Leto's performance in one scene with words his character should have listened to and additionally become a hypocritical drug addict, which is a brutalized truth that people using drugs are arrogantly ignorant of the dangers posed against their well-beings – and that shows how Aronofsky should've gone further in communication rather than focusing on the depressing spiral. Fairly praiseworthy on the aesthetics through the cinematography and acceptable surrealism despite the discomfort, but how can it be rated into the like if it's not enjoyable? If you ever watch this film, whether nighttime or not, immediately follow it with a more positive film, doesn't matter if it's a good one or a bad one, just to get rid of what your eyes just tasted. (B-)"
No Name,4.5,Unique camerawork. Ellen Burstyn is absolutely phenomenal. The movie tell the story of how vulnerable humans are in the face of urges and compulsions.
No Name,5,"Christ, this movie makes me never want to even get close to drugs.

This movie does a better job of scaring people away from drugs than any other PSA or DARE program ever could do.

""I'm going to be a star, Harry!""

5/5. Christ, now I'm going to need to call my mom before I break down."
No Name,4.5,"I'm not sure exactly what this movie was trying to say but somehow I know that it nailed it. This film was disturbing and difficult to watch but it's definitely worth it. The style here is unforgettable. My only complaint is that it was a little too gratuitous at times, but that doesn't hurt the overall experience much."
No Name,5,"Somehow shocking but showing the truth about relationships and abuse of any substances. The steps of addiction are shown in a wired way, make the audience feel the pain the protagonists are going through. Shallow and trashy conversations are just depicting Junkie's life at its best. Hard to watch if you are recovering. But yea."
No Name,5,"Um filme com uma narrativa muito boa,atuações incriveis onde nos mostra uma realidade triste e muito proxima de nós,além de um final que comove e choca ao mesmo tempo"
No Name,4,"An uncomfortable movie to watch and I mean that in the best way. There are great performances, stellar direction, bleak imagery, and an unsettling tone throughout."
No Name,5,The best way to blow your brains and drive you to a misserable and deplorable trance of the human condition.
No Name,5,Haunting. Terrifying. Beautifully done.
No Name,5,This is one of those movies that is utterly majestic and sublime. It is also horrific and should only be watched once.
No Name,5,Brilliant in its darkness
No Name,5,A very dark and riveting movie with a powerful soundtrack.
No Name,4.5,"Yes, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a beautifully made film, and exceedingly well-acted. But in a way, those positively-spun accolades are irrelevant red herrings and tangential false flags. Because the core attribute of ""Requiem for a Dream"" wholly eclipses every other with its pitch-black truth: Sometimes, dreams just don't come true. This is the bleakest film ever made, and there are people who should actively avoid it at all costs. It offers razor blades. Hopelessness. And the promise that if you subject yourself to watching it, you will know too much.

There are experiential darknesses that leave scars in life, but they're relegated to real-world experiences -- abuse, torture, addiction, death, grief. In film, only the experience of watching ""Requiem for a Dream"" can mimic in the psyche some of those destructive true life horrors. Consuming it can take things away from you.

""It's just a movie,"" you say. But when you say that, consider the possibility that you say it irresponsibly. The safe play here is to avoid ""Requiem for a Dream,"" and run the other way; the revelations it offers are just too insidious."
No Name,4,"Emotionally raw and exceptionally truthful, Requiem For A Dream is certainly a film with vision."
No Name,5,"Aronofsky truly knows how to unsettle me like no other. The amateur aesthetic only adds to the grotesque imagery. It's tough to watch but if you can stomach it, you are in for a wild ride that will stay with you"
No Name,3.5,A movie that may be a little too intense for some. Very dark. Has some good acting and directing. I felt depressed after watching this.
No Name,1,"I spent some time in a transitional housing and one of the therapist's who worked there heavily recommended seeing this hot piece of overrated garbage.
Two hours of my life I will never get back. The only highlights of this film were the string quartet and the old lady's convincing pitiful performance.
As an addict who hasn't touched drugs since my teens this movie is an insult to the lifestyle I had as a druggy.
Things just dont get this serious. And the acting, Marlon Wayans was more convincing in Dont Be A Menace , and where were his lines inspired from? Good Times?
Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly need to go back to their supporting roles in their respective superhero flops becuase this just doesn't cut it.
And though the camera work was definitetly something I have never seen before , this is definetly something I will never want to see again.
With the release of this film and that ""This is your brain on drugs commercial"" , I just dont understand how drug abuse could ever be a problem in the States post 2000.
""Requeim For A Dream"" was like watching a 2 hour marathon of Beyond Scared Straight on psychodelics, and even that tv show had better acting this, except for that old lady - that scene where she admits her loneliness to her son was the highlight to this film that tries so hard to exist that I almost vomitted watching it. I spent at least an hour and a half with bile at the back of my throat because this was on. 
Yes, the stories in this are thought provoking views on how drugs and minorities are treated in America , but this is like a far-left propaganda machine : extreme."
No Name,4.5,Stylistic and bleak. One of the truest depictions of addiction and how it effects your life and the lives of all those around you. Gut-wrenching.
No Name,1.5,What was so dark about this? People got what they deserved. What a terrible movie.
No Name,4,"Requiem for a Dream explores the harsh realities of addiction with intense imagery and incredible performances, and although it may be emotionally challenging for some to view, that is simply because it presents the brutal truth."
No Name,5,"First and foremost, Ellen Burstyn was robbed of an Oscar [again].  This is probably the best anti-drug film ever made. Talk about watching a car-wreck in slow motion. This is the death of hope.  The danger of self-delusion. Visually, it would be impossible to be any more in these people's shoes if you tried.  It is brilliant. Nauseating. Sad. Horrifying. It is a class in acting.  A class in editing. A class in directing. Get ready to be thoroughly depressed and numb.....in the best possible way."
No Name,4,This film is known for being dark and depressing but it's fantastic and the cast are incredible at portraying their self-destructive characters.
No Name,3.5,"I loved the very human aspect of the movie. It wasn't just a preachy story of ""look at these stupid kids doing drugs, don't do it''. It showed the characters' feelings and the different circumstances that make people behave in a way they normally wouldn't. Also, how was Wayans' acting more powerful than Leto's? Who decided it was ok to have that hairstyle and accent? I know the story comes from a book, but still. Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this environment though; pure aesthetic pleasure."
No Name,5,that was disturbing. this is the best movie i never want to see again.
No Name,5,"Aronofsky paints a brilliantly depressing and sobering picture of the horrors of addiction. The unusual camera style creates a visual roller coaster of the high to the crash. With the opioid crisis in the US out of control, this movie stay relevant 19 years later."
No Name,5,Equal parts intense and horrifying. It is everything you've heard and more.
No Name,5,"Incredible! The best and most f***** up movie I've never seen!
Never has a movie made all my senses more aware, and happy and sad!
Aronofsky's best!!!
One of most bad ass soundtrack!!!"
No Name,5,Una película de culto... qué más decir? Excelente e impactante.
No Name,3.5,"Interesting comparison of different drug habits. Disturbing, but not praising the addicts."
No Name,5,One of the best films ever made
No Name,5,"Very raw and intense film, definitely not for everyone. However, it's unique editing and storytelling will draw you into this film revolving around the use of drugs. I'm even scared to drink aspirin at this point lol."
No Name,4.5,Love this movie.  Been awhile.  Dark but accurate portrayal of addiction.  Great movie!!
No Name,5,"A movie not for all, but the performance of actress and actors are magnificent. The film represents (based on the book) people's addictions and it's consequences."
No Name,1.5,"I knew how this film would end from the get-go, and hoped the characters would have some sort of redemption.  I was very disappointed (unless you consider fetal position to be synonymous to redemption).  Well shot and directed, but so thin on story that I am sick to my stomach with no takeaway other than ""don't do drugs, kids""."
No Name,4,"Maaan, what a film it is! I finished it almost now, and this shocked me and said me again and again ""never use drug!"". I have watched lots of men when they using drug. But after spending my time on watching this masterpiece, I am sure I will never use it.
This is the pretty valuable ""don't use narcotic/drug"" ad I have seen ever. Actually, I watched lots of  films, even show in theatre, but this one is really powerful in its own way.  Also can be added that in terms of acting, especially performance of Jared Leto, it is type of the film I would love to rate as 8 star."
No Name,5,Convinced me not to do drugs (and kind of scared me).
No Name,3,weird in a fucking great way
No Name,3.5,"An incredibly touching film of addiction, loss and family. Confronting and powerfully honest."
No Name,3,The method of film making isn't as innovative as many would make it seem. But the story is depressing enough.
No Name,5,A masterclass in disturbing cinema
No Name,3.5,Confusingly brilliant.
No Name,5,"We got a winner! Wow, my fav film but i will never watch it again. Well i might, only if i want to cry again. Crazy and unforgiving. You will regret watching this, but you must watch it"
No Name,5,"Completely extraordinary. 
A depth detailed look into 
The life of addiction and 
What it can do to you. 

This movie should be taught 
In school to help avoid drug 
Abuse."
No Name,5,beautifully written . simply a classic .
No Name,4.5,"Innovative filmmaking that successfully imposes its tempo and holds your attention until the last second. Mainly using shock value than conventional storytelling, its eerie atmosphere gives a really dark tone to an already dark theme. The four protagonists are the perfect illustration of the ability of addiction to trigger the rapid demise or breakdown of a person's basic components: bodily integrity, mental health, freedom and dignity."
No Name,4,"Brilliant, shocking, and depressing. The acting is superb and the story is fascinating. But, it is a dark tragedy that some viewers may not be prepared for. I recommend for mature adults; definitely not a family film."
No Name,3.5,"Oof.

After bursting onto the scene with the bleak and unforgiving directorial debut that was ""Pi,"" Darren Aronofsky followed it up by tapping into the bibliography of author Hubert Selby Jr. and crafting this cinematic equivalent of one basically saying ""you ain't seen nothing yet."" As far as cinematic sack taps go, ""Requiem For A Dream"" isn't necessarily the most severe. But, dear God, is it going to be a massive buzzkill to whatever the hell you had going on in your life. As a visual experience, it is simply exhausting, but it's not all for naught. Many critics cite Aronofsky's provocative filmmaking style to be a bit excessive, if not obvious or lacking in finesse. And though I might find this critique to be true in some cases (i.e. ""mother!""), I think ""Requiem For A Dream"" might be that rare case where I couldn't see any other approach doing the story justice. This is a movie that hits that ""best of both worlds"" zone of provocateur filmmaking, where the product ultimately ends up being unnerving and difficult, yes, but also thought-provoking and called for. 

Do I ever want to see it again? Not really, no. But, man, did Ellen Burstyn ever deliver a career-defining performance, if I ever saw one."
No Name,2,Whole lot to hate about this
No Name,5,"The production, the concept, the plot.. everything is just brilliant!"
No Name,5,TOO realistic! Thank you darren!
No Name,4,"Requiem for a Dream is not a film that you just pop in on any given night. You have to be prepared to watch four characters slowly spin out of control due to drugs. This isn't a wholesome, the world is great kind of movie. It's painful to watch, but yet it's hard to not get invested in the story and feel curious about how it'll all end. There isn't much about this one to not like. The writing is great, the story is great, and the characters are all very interesting on their own. Oddly, the only thing I had a bit of an issue with was the cinematography. I just wasn't much of a fan of how it was all shot and the overall look of the film, but that's more of a nitpick than anything. Requiem for a Dream is a must watch, even if you can only get through it once."
No Name,3,"I would say this is A traumatising documentary on the hell hole of drug addiction, with a fantastic theme song."
No Name,2,Watch 4 people's lives breaking apart.
No Name,5,Such an amazing idea with such an amazing actors what means the best movie ever :D <3
No Name,5,"A daunting nightmare spiral of addiction.

Darren Aronofsky's mad drug fueled nightmare journeys the audience through the lives of 4 addicts of various substances. It is split into seasons starting with Summer, then Fall, Winter, and ends in Spring. I will be completely honest and say that it does have its faults. It can lack the subtlety of more mature films in its dialogue and appearance. However, this film is a collection of sequenced art scenes that are gorgeous in how haunting they become. In the end, you may be traumatized like so many that have viewed this film, but Requiem for a Dream will leave you thinking and disturbed. I can guarantee that much.

Jared Leto is a harrowing heroin addict. One of his best acting performances other than Dallas Buyer's Club. He oozes desperation for a fix exponentially throughout the film's duration. Jennifer Connelly is so sympathetic, you just feel worse and worse for her character for what she does for love, acceptance, and drugs. Marlon Wayans is more about making his place in the world with money and heroin dealing. You see his sad past lead to a broken future. Ellen Burstyn is perhaps the most underrated performance in Requiem for a Dream. Her addiction seems to be sugar, then you realize its television. Her obsession with watching leads her to ruination.

In short, Aronofsky demonizes substance abuse, but takes care in showing the downward spiral of addiction is the most exaggerated, but poignant way he knows. The cinematography will dazzle and terrify you. Clint Mansell's legendary and now infamous score will haunt you for the rest of your days. Darren Aronofsky's mad masterpiece is a demonstration of film making with innovative edits, cuts, synchronization, musical swells, and deranged sequencing. Nearly every scene is shot differently. It's a very interesting movie to look at in that I doubt you will be bored.

Check out Darren Aronofsky's unhinged film Requiem for a Dream if you dare. You have been warned."
No Name,4.5,Was totally unprepared for this film
No Name,5,"Requiem for a Dream is co-written and directed by, Darren Aronofsky (Pi) and this film is utterly fantastic. Filled with very intense and thrilling scenes that are emotionally and psychologically tormenting, this film understands the harsh reality of drug abuse. This film has great performances from all the cast members involved, and is truly a masterpiece of psychological cinema."
No Name,5,"This movie is incredible. The characters are so well written and acted, and the movie is immersive. People usually find this movie depressing, but I found it so captivating, intense, and enjoyable that I didn't feel sad afterwards. I've watched this movie more times than almost any other movie, and it's my 2nd favorite movie. I highly recommend it."
No Name,4,"Fantastic permanence by Leto and a very unique directing style, def something ive never seen before."
No Name,4,"A gut-wrenching exploration into drug abuse. Requiem For a Dream delivers a disgusting view of a dark reality no one wants to see, and it reflects it with a perfectly resonant message."
No Name,5,"This movie is one of these movies that has it all. The plot, cinematography, sound, editing, acting. All of it is great, but what really stands out is the editing. It keeps the viewer in suspense and at the edge of the seat. All of it is beautifully made and it's definitely a movie everyone should see at least once."
No Name,4.5,Unflinching uncompromising descent of four lives into a drug fuelled misery.  Fantastic acting and feels all too real. Don't do drugs kids.
No Name,3.5,"It's clear that Darren Aronofsky didn't want to make something new and special in the characters' arcs or the story, but he wanted to put you in the shoes of the characters with his creative use of visuals and sounds, and he succeeded.... kinda!  

Thanks to Aronofsky's direction that harmonized surreal visuals and sounds with the characters' feelings and experiences, I found myself experiencing and feeling what the characters experience and feel while watching the movie. Due to that, this is without a doubt one of the most disturbing and intoxicating movies I've ever watched. 

The problem is that the dramatic aspect in the movie actually harmed the movie; the dramatic scenes at the end of the first act slowed the pace of the movie down.
It's not the only or the major issue I've with this movie. The real issue is that the creative direction that elevated the stereotypical arc of Sara Goldfarb, wasn't enough to do this with the stereotypical arc of Harry and Marion. Also, the oscar-worthy performance by Ellen Burstyn (I really wanna know how she didn't win an oscar) and a few complications in her character, Sara Goldfarb's part was way better and more compelling than Harry and Marion's. I really didn't found myself relate to the characters of Harry and Marion so much, despite the great performances that Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly gave.
The perfect example that can affirm that the dramatic aspect wasn't the most powerful thing in the movie is the character of Tyrone; it's a very bland character and it was very hard for me to relate to its subplot, Marlon Wayans was very good though.  

I love Requiem for a Dream. It's a movie to experience not to watch. It really proves that Darren Aronofsky is a real talent that with his artistic direction can easily mess with your mind.

(7.5/10)"
No Name,1,very poorly made!! and soooo annoying to even sit thru and watch..
No Name,5,seen 2017. maybe rewatch
No Name,4,Great movie on all levels but so messed up.
No Name,4.5,"A film where not much positive happens and that which is positive is probably a drug-fuelled fabrication - yet this is necessary for a realistic portrayal of the terrors of drug addiction, whether illegal or prescribed. an incredible and gut-wrenching film."
No Name,4.5,"Wow, what a movie! Jason Bailey, writing for the New York Times, put it best when he wrote this about Requiem for a Dream: ""The hellhole of abusing drugs - from the ""hard stuff"" of heroin to the seemingly harmless likes of diet pills - is brought to blunt, brutal, visceral life in Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. The focus is on three friends in Brighton Beach who soon put their dreams on the back burner in pursuit of the next high, which gives way to the pursuit of the next one, and so on and so on (in increasingly shorter intervals). But the showcase performance here is Ellen Burstyn, who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance as an aging mother who becomes addicted to pills and gets increasingly lost in herself. Pounding and relentless, it's one of the most harrowing movies ever made about the horrors of addiction."""
No Name,2.5,"The filming style was very unique and interesting for half of the movie. After a while I felt like I was just watching a long, bad trip. The cinematography was great, captivating fear in every shot without a doubt. However, after a while I become bored of despair. The story was too truthful for my taste; too depressing."
No Name,4,"One of the best movie about drugs out there! So intense, so grounded, so rough. What it makes it work so well, is the amazing direction and the perfect music of Clint Mansell. A must-see!"
No Name,2.5,Worth watching once at least
No Name,5,"It's a devastatingly horrific parable of how enslaved we our to addiction. Its symbolic and queasy imagery will stick with you long after the credits roll. It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy cinematic art at its finest, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is right up your alley."
No Name,4.5,"""Requiem for a Dream"" has many metaphors about addiction, about our comfortable world, about how depressed we are. It's definitely one of my favorite drugs movies besides Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"". But, I prefer this film than the Boyle masterpiece. It's a harsh movie, a brutal movie, an honest movie. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, and now, Ellen Burstyn. They are all truly insane supported with such a haunting and beautiful score. Similar to the beauty of an obsession, an art of life. Stylish, honest, yet depressing. The viewing experience is very, very extraordinary but to be honest, I don't want to watch this film again. I just can't afford how terrifying this movie was."
No Name,4,"A gripping, haunting look at drug addiction that assaults the viewer in the rawest sense of the word by the end. The beginning takes some transitioning after which, Requiem is in constant flux of wild emotions, mania, and torturous intensity that will stick with you long after the credits roll."
No Name,3.5,"Just saw this movie in 2018 for the first time. Disturbing yet powerful imagery. Great and believable acting. Do I know what it's like to be addicted to drugs or medications, etc.? No. But if there's something this movie tells me it's to SAY NO."
No Name,4,"With Darren Aronofsky's latest film Mother starring Jennifer Lawrence arriving in theaters across the country this week, now is the perfect time to look back on the best of Aronofsky's career thus far. You can hear more about Mother and the style of Darren Aronofsky on the next ""Everyone Is a Critic Movie Review Podcast"" available on iTunes every Monday Morning. 

Darren Aronofsky is driven by an obsession with obsession. His characters are those that are driven past the brink of madness by their obsessions. The math in Pi, the drugs in Requiem for a Dream, love and immortality in The Fountain, to be the best in Black Swan, Piety and to build a boat in Noah, Aronofsky's characters are obsessives who risk everything for their goals no matter how dangerous or wrong-headed those goals may be. https://geeks.media/classic-movie-review-requiem-for-a-dream?_ga=2.57623146.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710"
No Name,3.5,Still easily Aronofsky's best film by some distance although I wasn't as blown away by it as when I first watched it 17 years...yes 17 years ago.  That piece of music is really overdone and it has dated a little.  Anyway setting that aside the central revolving story and the performances (Burstyn and Leto in particular) are brilliant.  I haven't read the book (yet) but this feels like a direct and successful translation from the page and the descent into misery for all involved has lost none of it's power.
No Name,4,"Puntaje Original: 7.5

Darren Aronofsky en todo su esplendor como director. Requiem for a Dream nos cuenta una historia poderosa, visceral, impactante y con una sincera, profunda y crítica visión hacia el extremismo de las adicciones humanas. Brillantes actuaciones y un estilo visual despampanante."
No Name,1,"One of the worst, most disturbing things i've ever seen... Watched for the song. Better classified as horror"
No Name,2.5,"Alguns filmes não divertem, apenas incomodam. A edição acerta muito nesse sentido. A personagem de Ellen Burstyn conquistou minha empatia. Para mim, Requiem For a Dream valeu a pena por causa dela."
No Name,4,"Requiem For A Dream: Afronosky showcases his talent for filmaking with bleak imagery, excellent preformances and a uncomfortable, daring, and depressing story, that is to much for some."
No Name,4,"Unrelenting look at the destructive power of addiction and obsession with an icing of social commentary about the powerful and powerless.  Aronofsky's best film, in my opinion, with stellar performances by Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn and Marlon Wayans. 

Aronofsky milks every scene for maximum emotion with incredible economy; few scenes last longer than a minute or two.  But the editing is almost supernaturally effective, juxtaposing images of the collapse of four lives with terrific coherence.

A depressing movie, but disciplined in a way that Aronofsky hasn't managed before or since."
No Name,4.5,An amazing movie. The acting is simply amazing. The thing that got me was the cinematography. During Ellen Burstyn's drug scene the camera work was so dramatic. It made it unforgettable. The movie was just amazing through and through.
No Name,4,"This is definitely an art house movie and not for main stream audiences. The quality and commitment of the actors is amazing, the editing is over used as a plot devise but this counter balanced by excellent use of the sound track. The remortless desent of the self destructive cycle is powerfully constructed, while I admire the technical skills that are on display in this movie, it was just too much for my over sensitive nature!"
No Name,3.5,"Ok movie starring Jared leto, the ending was weird."
No Name,5,"What an astonishing piece of work. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of my favorite films of all time, a disturbing and horrifying tale of four people destroying their lives in their pursuit of happiness and success. Through the subjective camerawork and unique editing style, writer-director Darren Aronofsky lets us delve into the mental state of these four characters, what they see, feel, and fear. Incredible performances throughout (Ellen Burstyn delivering one of the most unforgettable performances ever put in history of cinema) and packed with some dark imagery that sticks with you long after you finish the film. It's not for everyone and calling it a drug movie is doing disservice to what the film is actually about. It's deeper and more complex than that. It grabs you by the wrist and never lets go. What a great film."
No Name,3.5,"While the quality of the way this story was told was high, but this was also one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. The disturbing factor went a bit too far, otherwise I would have rated this film higher"

Requiem for a dream is the most intense movie I've ever seen, every single actor in this movie is amazing, but the best of them all is Ellen Burstyn, although Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly offered one of the best performances I ever Seen,Ellen Burstyn gives the best emotion acting I've ever seen , everything u can think of a movie, now think of a movie that does that everything that u can think of a movie right, u got this movie. It's perfect. the score and the events that take place keep ur heart pounding the whole time , this is not for the faint hearted as there are imagery and scenes that are very well done, so well done as it is a psychological horror that stick to ur mind, it's so friggin intense, this is not a heartwarming family movie at all , this is a film that challenges u and makes u sweat all over,every scene with Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb is so intense I don't even wanna see it, it's so effective it makes u scream from the insides,Ellen is so good u think of her character as the main one, although there should be no main character in this drama, The only flaws are the opening credits, and Marlon Wayans feel inferior as everyone is so good"
No Name,5,"Requiem for a Dream is a legitimate cinematic nightmare that takes viewers on a devastatingly real spiral into full-blown drug addiction. At times hard to watch, but even harder to forget, the film's pitch-perfect performances and spellbinding visual storytelling make it Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece."
No Name,4.5,"Requiem for a Dream (2000), directed by Darren Aronofsky, kind of makes you wonder about the filmmaker's past, and just what spurred him to make a movie as dark and depressing as this. It practically screams ""Don't do drugs, kids!"" but it does so in the artsy kind of way that keeps you enthralled and never even approaches the area of preachy. In fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction. 

Ranging from three of the seasons, summer to fall to ultimately winter, the film represents how the characters' lives get darker and colder with each season that progresses. Obviously, summer being the brightest and warmest, and winter being the darkest and coldest.

Addiction is a real thing, and throughout the film, you'll see through Aronofsky's eyes the kind of effects it can (will) have on you. Throw in a beautiful, melancholy score, and you get a touching motion picture that you'll never forget. I can actually hear the Lux Aeterna melody as I write this, but that's probably because I'm listening to it right now.

Requiem for a Dream hosts four main characters, Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, a more serious than normal Marlon Wayans as Tyrone, Jennifer Connelly as Marion, and Jared Leto as Harry Goldfarb, who has ties with each of the other three characters (mother, friend, girlfriend). Each of them is or will become addicted. And each of them meets different, yet terrible, fates in the end.

Ellen Burstyn brings the character of Sara Goldfarb to life so well that it makes me never want to grow old. Starting out as a sweet, (if a little kooky) lonely old woman, her quest to become beautiful again for her game show appearance that she can't wait for causes her to become addicted to diet pills, and everything in her life spirals out of control from there.

This film is not for everyone. If you'd rather watch a feel-good movie where the protagonist(s) prevail and everybody is happy in the end, you should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. Everyone else - come into this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the ride (if that's the correct phrase) that Aronofsky is about to take you through."
No Name,5,"The feeling I felt at the end of the film was the most absolute sadness, for having witnessed a tragedy so announced and at the same time so inevitable. Because ""Requiem for a dream"" is this: a hard and sad movie, as if someone punched him in the stomach. A precise mixture of despair and melancholy, which shows that we should rather dream, but that we must also be aware that no dream is worth it if it is to be achieved that we simply have to sell our soul. A great movie!"
No Name,4.5,"It's not a horror movie, but it's one of the most unsettling movies I've ever seen. The style that this film has is also incredible and unique, I really praise he second short segments shot during the drug taking scenes. The acting is also extremely powerful. This is a movie that likes to fuck with your mind, and it's by far the scariest, most disturbing non-horror movie I've ever seen, which is why it's so good. The score is also very eerie and haunting. Overall, it may not have the age yet to become a classic, but when it does, it's gonna be one hell of a classic. Recommended for sure !!"
No Name,5,This is the best movie ever created.
No Name,5,"One of the most powerful movie's and real life experience you'll have, especially if you never been around drug addiction. Great set of cast and tremendously well acted. Personal top 10 movies ever. Must watch."
No Name,0.5,"Today I watched my cat take a dump in the yard. He spent a solid 3-5 minutes trying to bury it. I walked over and it wasn't even close to being sprinkled with dirt and grass. And it smelled really bad.
Watching my cat shit in the yard and unsuccessfully bury it was better than watching requiem for a dream"
No Name,5,"Moral of the story - don't do drugs kids. I say that cynically of coarse. But the fact is that these characters stories could happen to anyone and probably has happened to some people, sadly. 

On a less negative note, I think Ellen Burstyn's performance was phenomenal. I think she deserves every Emmy every award, ever accolade possible for what she achieved in this movie. Fantastic performance.

Overall, great film with very disturbing themes and a genuine Aronofsky experience. One time watch I think."
No Name,5,This movie is fantastic.A must see.
No Name,4,A well-made movie showing the various repercussions of drug abuse.
No Name,5,"Horrifying, fascinating, and visceral. Disgusting and depressing without being a tired slasher or cliché horror film. Practically indescribable, and the only way to understand my rating is to see it. Not suitable for most people, however-the intimate dive into the depths of drug addiction and subsequent insanity are too much for some to stomach."
No Name,4.5,"Requiem for a Dream is not an easy watch. I am desensitise to most things but even I winced a couple of times when watching this. This makes Trainspotting look like the Teletubbies in terms of its horribly graphic depiction of drugs. Four of the best combined performances in modern cinema help that. Jared Leto is scarily convincing, Ellen Burstyn is almost traumatising to watch, Jennifer Connelly is also worrying because of how good she is and Marlon Wayans is terrific as well, he should have done more serious films, he is a great actor. He stole most of the scenes he was in. The colour pallet in this film is also genius. Everything is very dull, like their lives apart from the few things that bring them joy, like the red dress. Having one of the most iconic movie scores of all time helps too."
No Name,4,Wanted to give it five stars but tablet would not let me. This movie is extremely intense extremely real. Recommend everyone should see
No Name,4,Gritty presentation of the realistic possibilities of addiction and the broken lives that circle around it.
No Name,4,"Difficult to watch, but necessary. A drug movie that looks at different forms of addiction, aging, and loneliness. Pacing slips a little towards the end."
No Name,4,"Good movie, satisfying story, distracting cinematography."
No Name,1,"Clever, but I didn't like it. I'm sure it follows in the same vein as Trainspotting.  A movie I have yet to see. Or want to. Too many scene splicing montage action, and heavy with the chaos of several characters experiencing intense endeavors."
No Name,5,"This movie embodies the bleakness of being young without money or prospects, while also being representative for being old, insecure and lonely. I loved every single second of it."
No Name,4,"A very sad, and perhaps stereotypical view of the drug world, but overall I felt connected to the characters. Some great acting, and definitely gives you a rush, although the comedown is a little bleak. maybe that was the point. overall I liked it, but a re-watch isn't necessary ... but I probably will, if I get the craving ."
No Name,5,"This shocking film tell us a story about people, who want their wishes come true. They can pay a lot to get this what they want."
No Name,4.5,what a movie!! absolutely mind blowing experience...

Grade: A+"
No Name,3,This is a hard-hitting film about drugs and addiction - you have been warned! It is not an easy ride.
No Name,5,Requiem for a Dream throws us into the pit of addiction and in the driver's seat of the deeply tragic characters.
No Name,5,"Great movie, but one you will not bear to watch again. However, the film is spectacularly directed and will stay with you for a long time after the credits roll."
No Name,5,"Amazing film. The cast does a great job especially Ellen Burstyn, its directed and edited perfectly, and the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. It's haunting and disturbing, but impossible to look away from. It's basically the ultimate anti drug movie."
No Name,5,"Visceral, inventive, hallucinatory, and downright terrifying. Darren Aronofsky has made something that is objectively compelling. This is strong Gen X filmmaking that also plays host to one of the strongest performances of modern cinema: Ellen Burstyn's transformative performance as Sara Goldfarb.

It's a masterpiece with purposeful hip-hop music video energy about age, addiction, greed, and empty, desperate clawing toward status. The characters in this cautionary tale all begin with focused gaze and perseverance, which devolve into a nightmare of sin, evil, and shame."
No Name,4,Words cant describe feelings I relive every time I watch Requiem For a Dream.
No Name,5,Emotionally disturbing but filled with excellent performances. Requiem For A Dream is a terrifying and realistic look at the scary mind of a drug addict that will get deeply under your skin until the last frame of this film.
No Name,1,The most depressing movie I have ever seen.
No Name,3.5,"Pretty Good = 3.5/5

Though I found it hard to watch at times, due to the sick and uneasy feeling it constantly left in my stomach, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a very well made, thought provoking film, with some fantastic performances by its cast."
No Name,4.5,Remarkable drug movie that you will remember.
No Name,5,"Best drug movie ever...
Darren Aronofsky is a genius..."
No Name,3,A pretty good movie but the farther you get into it the more exaggerated and unrealistic it becomes. I don't know if that was what the director was going for or if he just doesn't know much more about the subject matter than what he has read in newspapers and sitcoms. It just seems like the closest he's been to drugs or users is about three degrees of separation.
No Name,4,"This is a great film. The first 45 minutes is quite shot, but after that this film is amazing! Very weird film but loved it!"
No Name,5,Sublime! Best film to close a Century.
No Name,4.5,"Oh boy... 

Oooooooh boy...

Requiem for a Dream is an exercise in how miserable can you make your audience without making them want to walk out, and it does that, fairly flawlessly. This Darren Aronofsky tragedy succeeds through strong writing, directing and powerful performances from an ensemble cast.  

Requiem For A Dream follows four Manhattan Beach characters; the son played by Jared Leto, (Dallas Buyers Club), his grandmother played by Ellen Burstyn, (The Exorcist, Interstellar), his girlfriend played by Jennifer Connely, (A Beautiful Mind, Blood Diamond), and his best friend played by Marlon Wayans, (White Chicks, Scary Movie). It follows them as they each build up their hopes and dreams, only to have it torn back down again by their own personal addictions. It's like Of Mice and Men on speed, literally, and good. 

I pitch this film to everyone as a must see, it's a film you should definitely see once, and then never again! It's based on a book by Hubert Selby Jr. who co-wrote the screenplay with Aronofsky, (Black Swan, The Wrestler), a writer famed for his understanding of that sort of low life New York culture and his skill in portraying it, and that really comes through in the film which is scuzzy beyond belief. The dialogue and syntax and slang of the characters really sell them as being in this world, an the grungy lighting, and subtly but meticulously crafted frames help. Subtle beauty, maybe Ang Lee can learn a thing or two. 

The reason Requiem For A Dream works so well is that before it tears them down, it builds up your relationship with the characters, gets you to empathise with them and feel for them and like them, it builds up their hopes and makes their dreams seem wonderfully possible before their falls. In fact that's literally the structure of the film, which is simple but genius, the three acts are denoted by the seasons; summer, fall, and winter. Our associations with each word complimenting the acts. This character involvement would't work if it wasn't for a collection of quite outstanding performances. Leto's accent is a bit ropey but you get used to it and he does everything else really well. There's one scene with a phone call that I nearly cried watching. I wanted to. Wayans gives an uncharacteristically serious performance and he does it really well. When people were wondering why on earth the man behind all these shit parody movies was being invited to join the American Academy I remembered Requiem For A Dream in which he is charismatic and empathetic. The real stand out though, is Elen Burstyn, who was actually Oscar nominated for this movie and boy does she deserve it. By far the most complex character she gives a powerhouse performance in which she is believable but just extraordinarily brittle. Again, there's a scene where Leto comes to visit that's by far the most memorable scene in the film and again I nearly welled up. 

In the end it's moments like those that are the key to understanding the hypnotic, mesmeric, enigmatic attraction of Requiem For A Dream, it has a lot of bleak imagery, and montages that will leave you traumatised but it's interspersed with moments of pathos and emotional sadness that are much more subtle and give the more traumatic sequences weight that without it would just seem gratuitous, and worse, slightly immature, using these images without any understanding of the weight they carry. However, luckily, Aronofsky and Selby Jr. know exactly what they're doing and they do it well. It's carried off with a style, professionalism and maturity that belies that this is only Aronofksy's second film, and first bigger budget one. 

Also, I have to mention Clint Mansell's beautiful, melancholy but perversely techno-influenced score, it's truly amazing."
No Name,5,Extremely dark and just plain sad at parts but I just couldn't look away.  Great film.
No Name,5,one of the best movies I've ever seen.

No Name,5,Wow! Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar! Most amazing performance I have ever seen! This is the best work Jennifer Connelly has done. Leto and Wayans are equally good! This movie is a touching and terrifying look at how drugs can take over lives and how quickly can destroy them. This is a rollercoaster ride with a knockout ending. Hang on to your seats.
No Name,5,"Okay. I get it. Don't do drugs. However, this movie is so much more than that. Aside from its very dark material, it is a joy to watch. I suppose only someone into the film-making style would agree with me, but ""Requiem For A Dream"" keeps a relenting pace that only grows stronger as it progresses, and my eyes can never turn away. While the subject matter is extremely somber, there is a jovial essence that is quite abundant. How masterful to make a film so strong in its message and to also have it resonate in your bones afterwards. It's not a wake up call, it's your surprise birthday party disguised as an intervention."
No Name,4,Damn. Should have watch The Big Lebowski. This is depressing...
No Name,0.5,No idea what was going on but I'm not interested to find out too.
No Name,3.5,"Con uno stile unico e scene esplicite e crude, Requiem for a Dream è un film con una visione strettamente pessimistica: il regista Darren Aronofsky sceglie una storia che non presenta neanche la minima luce di speranza, ed il risultato è commovente e difficile da dimenticare."
No Name,5,"The best film in the world, the editing , sound, the cinematography, the acting the sound track its all just brilliance and truly masterpiece in every aspect of great film making. Something very eye opening."
No Name,5,"Heart-stopping, gut-wrenching, breath-taking bravura. Drugs are a hellhole. This film exposes that, and the painful emptiness underneath the surface. See it and feel its effect. Let it transform you in a way few films can."
No Name,4,"Requiem for a Dream is maybe one of the most depressing and heart breaking movies in the history of cinema, featuring an old woman,  who starts doing drugs to fight back her addiction to chocolate and sweets and attend her favorite TV show unsuccessfully, whose son is a junkie like his best friend and his girlfriend. 

The movie is divided in three parts:
-SUMMER, where the characters are introduced, and where Aronofsky gives the audience hope about the future of them. The love between Harry and Marion is particularly exalted, like Sara's typical widow's way to live. All the main characters underestimate their addiction to drugs as they reach their top. 
-FALL, where everything start crumbling. Drugs take control over everyone's life. 
-WINTER, aka the saddest part of the movie. Not crying is a challenge at this point, as Arronofsky great technique to create a link to all the characters makes you feel like you are part of their lives. 

The movie is not perfect at all, as it features a really poor character's design, an overall repetitive pacing before the latter part, a sometimes confusing photography, but has a strong and perfect soundtrack (one of the most famous in the world), a great plot and is just so entertaining, you sometimes forget to be seeing a DVD. With Trainspotting, this is the best ""don't do drugs"" movie ever, although I wouldn't recommend it to weak people as it may be one of the less enjoyable experience ever."
No Name,4,"Requiem for a Dream is a great movie with a talented cast, in which Ellen Burstyn shines the most."
No Name,3.5,Glad I watched it... Will never watch it again! No thanks!
No Name,5,"Powerful, unforgettable, and absolutely heartbreaking, Requiem For A Dream finds Darren Aronofsky at his best, pulling out spectacular performances from Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Connelly, sending out a warning about the dangers of drugs and modern media."
No Name,5,"Requiem for a Dream holds the psychological depth expected of an Aronofsky work, but unlike other films I've seen of his, this one feels empathetic and hopeful. During the Summer chapter of the movie, we truly believe that the characters may have a future, but come Winter, all hope is lost in one of the most effectively depressing and sobering scenes in all of cinema. Requiem, while not the most adult movie I've seen, is certainly inappropriate for younger audiences--yet, that is not the reason I might hesitate to recommend it. The ending is truly unsettling and saddening, and left me in a state of introspection and loneliness."
No Name,5,"This film is the quintessential drug movie. Skip the D.A.R.E program and just watch this. Amphetamines, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine & Opiates; this mix may not kill you but it's certainly going to try. The drama here revolves around the relationships of these friends and family. Altogether another fantastic film but yet again not journey for the weak at heart. This one will leave the boldest of the bunch; pale in the face. It's a visual spectacle as well; for Aronofsky to try such rapid edit techniques and experimental camera work at the time (2002) was truly avant guard. His next visual leap can be witnessed in 2006's The Fountain. Yet another of his signature films, intense and graphic. The performances here though are ahead of their time and the initial NC-17 rating will keep many from viewing."
No Name,1,"Arronofsky seems more focused on mortifying the audience than telling a good story with his disturbing images and idiot plot narrative. The characters act so stupidly, whatever sympathy we have for them is completely eradicated by the end. Dark, disgusting and overall, bad. I do not recommend."
No Name,3,"This was thoughtful and well done, but I felt this movie was too unrealistic. Worth watching, but it's a fairly whitewashed depiction of heroin addiction.  Then again, who would watch it if it wasn't?"
No Name,3.5,"Requiem for a dream is a really good film. Darren Aronofsky utilizes some very interesting directing methods which makes the film unique and makes it stand out from other movies of the same genre. The actors are fantastic in their respective roles and the movie has some pretty intense sequences that make it stick with you hours after the film ends. Some parts of the film feel out of place, though, and some characters do some really absurd things that make the viewer not empathize with them and their decisions."
No Name,5,"This  movie is just perfect. Excellent direction, fantastic actors. I love it."
No Name,4.5,".......

That's my review.  An ellipses."
No Name,2.5,"If displaying the consequences of a life of drugs was the agenda, this was accomplished.  If making an entertaining movie was the agenda not so much."
No Name,5,"Every high schooler should be forced to watch this movie, which is more than just a movie - it's a brutal, soul-scarring intervention."
No Name,4.5,"What a trip. What a fucked up, disturbing, ugly, colourless, gritty, painful, numbing experience. But it was worth it. There is nothing, there is no movie that feels like an experience more than this one, and it's so goddamn real. And the fact that it's sixteen fucking years old... It's heartbreaking, it's painful, it's depressing, it's real. It's real. It feels so real. The movie really depressed me. It really brought me to just thinking low and sad. It's not a movie for the faint of the heart, if you're not ready (I wasn't ready for this movie when I watched it), yeah, don't watch it. But it's incredible. I hated myself for watching it but I don't regret watching it at all. How Ellen Burstyn got robbed of an Oscar is beyond me."
No Name,4,"This movie conveys the feelings of anxiety and paranoia so incredibly well that it's hard to say that this movie is enjoyable. However, the imagery is powerful and quite successful in achieving its purpose of exposing the horrors of addiction. So while I wouldn't say I enjoyed watching this movie, I'm glad that I did."
No Name,5,It kills you on the inside
No Name,4.5,Probably one of the darkest movies I've seen in my life.
No Name,5,This movie is fabulous and lovely to me. Great movie to me ever
No Name,4.5,Masterful filmmaking. Every scene just has such a good rhythm. Requiem For a Dream is full of creative and original ideas. Its extremely uncomfortable but this film has purpose and artistry. Thank God for Darren Aronofsky
No Name,2,Certainly not a Sunday afternoon film!
No Name,4.5,One of the most devastating and visually impactful films ever made. Sticks with you forever. Cried my eyes out after barely blinking through the end credits.
No Name,4,"Never before have I seen a film (or anything for that matter) that has shown the harsh realities of the drug world. If you don't want your kids to do drugs, then you should show them this movie."
No Name,5,A brutal look at the harsh reality of the toll drug abuse takes on human beings.
No Name,4,"Whilst it borders on becoming a little too 'MTV' (what that means makes sense to me, at least), 'Requiem For A Dream' has more than enough gusto and originality to get away with its endlessly dark and moody storytelling.

The performances are strong, though no one really stood out- likely because of the majority of the film's subdued nature. However, when it does build up Burstyn delivers something memorable and fascinating. 

Really, it was Sara Goldfarb's story that kept me engaged and interested here and I think it easily made up for some of the film's weaker points. It would be very easy for a film taking itself this seriously to be nothing but a complete joke and whilst, this possibly comes somewhat close at times, it never actually ends up there and I think that's a credit to Aronofsky's direction- this isn't a film trying to be cool, it's just legitimately cool at times. The way he captures frantic addictive tendencies is a real technical achievement and it makes up for some of the script's, quite generic, interpretations of these same concepts.

Deserving of its cult status but still just a little too nineties if we're being honest (though I believe it's technically a film of the noughties but, facts are irrelevant)."
No Name,3.5,Parallel experiences of both extremes of the life spectrum. drug abuse is devastating no matter how old or responsible you are.
No Name,5,"Watching Requiem For a Dream was an experience with lasting effects. It's the most hopeless film I've seen to date with a completely ruthless portrayal of drug addiction and the horrors associated. This is not as much due to the subject matter, but more so to how the characters' struggles are so sympathetic, and these struggles being presented with such scrutiny by Darren Aronofsky and the cast that is devastatingly painful to watch.

There is an unwavering sense of disgust from the opening scene, and it never lets up from there, making it the only film that I can confidently say I wanted to squirm in my seat while watching. It is an upsetting film in every sense of the word, made apparent by the emotional performances, the characters' goals in life slowly slipping through their fingers (hence the title) due to their use of drugs, and the uncomfortably close camera angles that give the viewer a cringe-inducing sense of entrapment. 

It's easy to think of this film before seeing it and assume it is purely dependent on the significance of the subject matter with no substance from a filmmaking standpoint. However, if the film lacked in filmmaking, it would not be nearly as upsetting. Darren Aronofsky knows how to trap the viewers into the horrible events with a stellar cast, Clint Mansell's haunting score, and an unwavering sense of dread. This dread is made possible by how the characters are crafted. Watching them abandon dignity, hold onto false hope, and stomach such disturbing situations made me almost struggle to stay seated, a feat no other film has accomplished. 

One cannot talk about this film without mentioning Ellen Burstyn's performance. She is tied with Essie Davis in The Babadook for my favorite performance by an actress. What they do so well is make the viewers feel such pity for their miserable lives with performances so convincing that it's easy to forget that they are actors. Although Burstyn outshines everyone else, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly are fantastic in their roles, doing what Aronofsky most definitely expected them to do: Make the audience feel their characters' pain.

As well as the performances, what Aronofsky does technically is equally astounding. Whether a director can add more layers to the story than what is on paper is what separates a mediocre director from a great one, and Aronofsky proves himself to be the latter. Aronofsky uses the same editing technique each time a specific character takes a specific drug, for instance. As the viewer counts the times the technique is used, they feel more and more despair as the characters addictions become gradually stronger. 

*****SPOILERS FOLLOW*****

Where his technical skills really shined for me was the final scene where he wraps up the film perfectly. He shows a montage of our characters laying down, and provides so much with this one directorial choice. All characters except that of Jared Leto assume the fetal position. My interpretation of this is that it's a gesture of despair, conveying a similarity between them.

The position also indicates that they are clutching the one thing that helps them take their mind off their new unbearable lives. The reason Harry (Jared Leto) does not assume the position is that he has nothing to hold on to. Every other character does, but the thing that gives them hope is what makes each character arc distinct from the others.

Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) clutches the thought of his mother, making him the most hopeful character since he is being forcefully held from his drugs and still has thoughts of a peaceful life. Although the movie shared a theme with Trainspotting in conveying the frightful easiness of slipping into addiction with the story of Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Darren Aronofsky himself said that Tyrone is the only character with hope of escape. 

Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is similar in that she has something that gives her hope, but different in that she has completely abandoned her life. She curls herself around the heroin she went to such desperate measures to get her hands on, showing how drugs are her salvation from her new life even though they are the cause.

The film concludes with perhaps the most depressing character arc in the movie, which is that of Sara Goldfarb. Solidifying the heart-breaking monologue she gives earlier, the thing she holds on to is the fantasy of appearing on television. She knows this will never happen, but the thought of it comforts her. Within this fantasy, her son Harry is implied to have married his girlfriend Marion and appears well-dressed and happy. Him and his mother tell each other they love each other, and the film fades to its end credits. What makes this character arc the most depressing out of all of the others is that her son's life and their relationship being healthy is within the fantasy of her appearing on television. This suggests that her son loving her and vice versa is just as outlandish as her television fantasy. That notion is emphasized further by Sara smiling, but tears running down her eyes can be seen. 

The way Aronofsky presented the film's wrap-up is the major highlight of his directorial talents within this movie. He knew to convey more ideas visually than what is shown through dialogue and the actors' performances, making this movie's presentation of the subject matter all the more complex. Although it is a film that had me emotionally drained long after seeing it, I cannot deny that it is excellently crafted."
No Name,5,"Requiem for a Dream is dark and grim, yes. But it's an important film that will linger in your memory for years to come. It's frenetic editing and pace is sublime, and has some of the best performances of each actor's career. A true masterpiece."
No Name,3.5,WOW! that was intense! Love the hip hop montage and overall crazyness. mind blowing :O
No Name,5,"Harrowing, thought-provoking, and unforgettable."
No Name,5,Best movie about drug addiction
No Name,5,"Anyone who has a history with substance abuse will find this movie very disturbing.  What starts off as a glorification of use, suddenly takes a 180, erases any feelings of nostalgia that you felt, and replaces it with fear, sadness, and remorse.  Depending on the severity of your history with substance abuse, this movie will punch you in the gut, then kick you in the nads, and then torture you with the realities and eventual outcomes of addiction.  In a sense, this story could be a blueprint for the degenerate gambler, the alcoholic, and even to a degree, the tragedies of mental illness (ie the gut-wrenching fight between yourself and your mind; the deterioration of sanity).  If any of this is applicable to you, I'm really rooting for you and your happiness.  I hope this film proves to be more of a stark reminder re the your past, vs a snapshot of what you're experiencing."
No Name,2.5,"5.7/10 — ""Mediocre""/""Passable"""
No Name,3,"Where a visual treat, and a very disturbing tale about the murky drugged underworld (both legal and illegal). It leaves several gaps that are strange even by Aronofsky standard.

That being said, you'll find yourself having to remind yourself to breathe occasionally as certain tensions successfully keeps you on edge throughout."
No Name,5,"Unlike other reviewers who rate movies subjectively with their feelings, I rate this movie five stars objectively based on the quality of the storytelling, direction, acting, music, and camera work.  All five of these elements were top notch.  Was the movie difficult to watch?   Yes.  Did I want to curl up into the fetal position and hug my mother afterwords?   Oh yes.   Ellen Burstyn's performance of an amphetamine-addicted middle aged single mother that degenerates into drug-fueled insanity is perhaps the greatest acting Performance I've ever witnessed and will haunt me forever.  The Academy robbed her at the Oscars by giving it to Julia Roberts for Erin Brokovitch. One of the worst Oscar snubs, in my opinion.  I'm sure the Oscar voters that year could have used a dose of objectivity themselves."
No Name,4.5,"This is a film that has really grown on me with repeat viewing.  It's certainly not easy going, but it's a remarkable adaptation of Selby's novel ... really capturing the sense that the seeds of these character's downfall have been planted even before the story begins.  It makes the small moments of hope all that more poignant.  I think there are really only three serious missteps.  It's a mistake to have nominally updated the story's setting to the present day since several aspects of the plot only really make sense in the context of the book's early 70's time frame. While the film is stylish, it's also generally realistic and believable in tone, which makes the excessiveness of the Ellen Burstyn's hallucinations in one key scene stand out as too much.  Finally, while Marlon Wayans is good in this (can that be said of ANY other movie he's in), his character is brutally underdeveloped."
No Name,4,Powerful - the kind of film that makes you feel empty inside.
No Name,4.5,"A very disturbing but yet engrossing look at how drugs can turn someone's life to rock bottom. I really loved how the film continually moved from each of the four characters slowly faster and faster, until the finale was a whirlwind of flashes of them struggling to survive, leaving an impression on me that will not soon be forgotten. The acting was great, Marlon Wayans gives the best performance I've ever seen from him and Jared Leto was really good too. The director used a bunch of really cool camera effects that were fun to look at and didn't distract from the message the film was sending. Requiem for a Dream is a really harsh look at drug addiction, but I would consider it necessary viewing"
No Name,3.5,"Scary, dark, disturbing, hard to watch, but it's a must see for everyone."
No Name,4.5,Probably Marlon Wayans' best work.
No Name,0.5,A film only enjoyed by media students.
No Name,5,In my top 3 for best films ever seen. One of the first films to make feel emotions I never felt before and I will defend that to my grave.
No Name,4.5,"Powerful doesn't even describe how I felt upon viewing Requiem for a Dream. Jared Leto continues to amaze me, Marlon Wayans shocked me with a dramatic performance and Jennifer Connelly shines. Darren Aronofsky takes us on journey that will leave you in tears, depressed and amazed. Verdict: buy with confidence"
No Name,5,"Haunting soundtrack, outstanding directing, and lifelike acting accompany this work of art with a hard hitting message."
No Name,2,"Personally being someone who has struggled with addiction for a long time, I am always drawn towards movies that broach the subject of addiction.  When talking amongst other addicts about movies on this subject, usually Requiem for a Dream is everyone's favorite, for being so realistic and in your face.  But just cause something is realistic does not mean it is automatically going to make a great feature length film.  Jared Leto is really good in this movie portraying the role of the drug addict very authentically.  Just his physical look alone. The soundtrack is downright disturbing and matches the subject matter perfectly. It is funny though, most people will say the standout performance in Requiem is from Ellen Burstyn, I disagree, I think Leto takes the cake for this movie.  The mother's descent into addiction due to a fascination that she is going to be on a television show and must lose weight becomes really disturbing and almost annoying by the end of the movie.  This is a movie that you feel like you need to take a shower after you watch it, because you feel so dirty.  Yes it is a very authentic movie when it comes to addiction, but a tad over the top if you ask me, if they cut out some of the more disturbing things, I think this movie really would have been better, but that's just me.  I would not recommend this to the average movie fan."
No Name,3,"This is a really hard movie to review.  At one end, it is a very dark realistic film about addiction, with great performances from all involved.  On the other end, it is one of those movies that is so disgusting and disturbing that its hard to watch but also hard to take your eyes off of.  The best way to describe this movie is, you feel like you need to take a shower after you watch it.  Being a former addict myself, someone who knows all too well about the depths addiction can take you to, I find the movie very realistic but also a bit overblown.  Some parts I feel like I can relate to and other parts I just feel are put in there for shock value.  It has a very dark and slow deliberate pace as do most of Aronofsk's films.  But overall I would not go out of my way to recommend this movie to the average movie watcher."
No Name,5,One of the first films that I saw that helped me see the difference between a film and a movie.
No Name,4,"bons plans de camÃ©ra! suspence jusqu'Ã  la fin qui est d'ailleurs, Ã  la limite troublante!"
No Name,5,"This is a requiem for living dead.
In the desperate reality, I want them to sleep peacefulltonight."
No Name,5,"Be prepared for one of the most violent nightmares imaginable, back in a time when, Aronofsky, was more than capable of smashing your teeth in with a hammer for over an hour. Requiem is the chilling tale that surrounds 4, drug addicted human beings, who are all connected. It  documents the progression of the rise and fall of drug addiction, showing the glamorous highs and the frightening lows, highlighting the extremes people will go to, in order to get their next fix. In Aronofsky's second outing, he manages to craft a film so unique and arresting, its almost impossible to look away, despite the horror unfolding on screen. Led by an all star cast, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waynes, Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, Aronofsky lobs his characters into the depths of hell and then for good measure throws us, the audience, in after them. Shot in a stylish but very rough looking demeanor, Requiem may fool you into thinking your about to witness the same old drug related tale, however the script soon pole vaults into another world, full of dreams and aspirations, demands and exceptions, Aronofsky isnt afraid to tackle some difficult subject matter here, really getting into the meat off all 4 characters downfalls and its harrowing to watch. His quick cut and ominous style becomes a staple of normality straight off the bat and paces the film wonderfully. Requiem doesnt feel bloated, nor does it ever grind to a halt, its constantly on the move, utilizing sound and a blistering soundtrack from Clint Mansell and The Kronos Quartet, to its full advantage. The film weaves in and out of normality, using a wide array of visual techniques, in order to disorientate the audience, which by the finale will have you feeling like you, yourself are coming off a year long drug binge. It's horrible and gritty, intense and creative, stylish and violent to such an extent, Requiem should come with a viewer discretion advised sticker. One of cinema's rare treats, that gets under your eyelids and stings for the duration of its stay, a must own, however approach with caution."
No Name,4,An unconventional work of art
No Name,0.5,Why did i sit through this?  How did it get a rating this high?
No Name,4,Hou will need several reality checks especially at the climax of the film. One of the most entertaining movies that is able to make you feel terrible. Not a feel good movie. and not a family movie. But this movie sets out what it attempts to do. To make a psychological thriller that will leave you thinking about it for the remainder of your week.
No Name,4.5,"Requiem for a Dream is excellent in terms of acting, directing, score. It is the type of film I'd like to rate as five stars but too many mistakes were made. There were many useless scenes (e.g. ice cream stand with the cop) and the end was far overwrought. Instead the time would have been better spent developing the Tyrone character more. Overall, the work is very talented but also amateurish. Like the culture it portrays, Requiem for a Dream is a mixture of flaws and flashes of brilliance."
No Name,0.5,I was disgusted by this film. The soundtrack is the only thing that makes me give this 1/2 star.
No Name,5,"Watch it once, and you become ""addicted""! Oh, the irony. A masterpiece coupled with one the most powerful soundtracks the music industry has ever witnessed."
No Name,5,"A masterpiece that Ive only seen once, one day I will get the stomach to watch it again."
No Name,3,"It's not a great movie, but it is a good one.  This film is really going to stick in my head though despite its flaws and lack of cohesion or character development.  If I had to describe this film in just one sentence, I would say it is a symbolic clash between our own consuming desires and the harsh reality that comes with the consequences of what we may be wiling to do to achieve ""happiness"".  I am serious though...I don't think I can watch this film again.  The last 15 minutes literally gave me a nervous breakdown.  I mean, it was heavy, Doc!  The acting was superb, the cinematography/editing/camerawork was absolutely suiting to the message of addiction and harmful desire that it was hoping to convey, and the soundtrack was beautifully intense.  Although this movie is no masterpiece, it is also a film you WILL NEVER forget.  I feel psychologically violated."
No Name,1,"Overrated garbage just like the other Darren Aronofsky films I've seen. A large potion of this film is quick cuts of random things shown in fast motion. It's not art, it's random bullshit. The one positive thing I can say is that performers weren't bad. Otherwise, this movie is a screwed up, depressing waste of time."
No Name,5,It really leaves a hard feeling on your gut when you finish it for the first time.
No Name,4,"Surprised I took so long to finally watch this.  Visually beautiful, chaotic, terrifying, and disgusting with strong performances by the whole cast, a great soundtrack, and probably the best anti-drug/addiction film you'll ever see."
No Name,5,"It will be too intense for some to stomach,but viewers with enough patience to get through, Requiem for a Dream will show sheer power and unparalelled honesty of its Story"
No Name,5,"Darren Aronofsky sempre buscou maneiras diferentes de contar um história - e todos seus filmes diferem entre si em linguagem e isso é admirável. Aqui, a montagem quase de videoclipe dá o tom à narrativa sobre chegar ao fundo do poço e descobrir que ainda se está longe do fundo. E o elenco, mesmo Marlon Wayans, é excelente, principalmente Ellen Burstyn."
No Name,4,"Requiem for a dream is satisfyingly challenging. Although there were some trivial errors, it would tug on the emotions of even the heartless. Becoming more and more fast paced throughout the movie, my heart was racing by the end."
No Name,4.5,Most realistic movie about addiction I've seen. This is what it's like to be a junkie.
No Name,3.5,"I just thought it needed a more structured storyline and conclusion; it was TOO ambiguous and as they said, hard to digest it all. But overall, the performances, directing & cinematography are freaking brilliant."
No Name,4.5,"With dark and unsettling imagery, ""Requiem for a Dream"" will get to you one way or another."
No Name,4,??? ?? ???? ???? ?? ???? ??? ?? ???? ?? ???? ???.
No Name,4,"Excellent filmmaking overall, and an incredible script. Ironically, too depressing."
No Name,4,Aronofsky works his Midas touch.
No Name,4.5,"absolute terrifying and absolute disturbing. Extremely depressing and heartbreaking. This film is ballsy in so many ways. While it's not enjoyable to watch(seriously don't watch it with your parents or anyone), the film is a great piece of art-- it pushes buttons, changes things, speaks as a strong voice no single person can have.."
No Name,3.5,"Not entirely sure what to make of it - aronofsky's call for not taking drugs? either way, leto's and especially connelly's cold turkey desperation is pretty awesome."
No Name,5,"One of the most tragic and intense movies I have ever seen. This movie grabs your attention with masterful directing and editing, then throws you into the downward spiral of the destruction drugs can inflict on you. The acting is powerful, the imagery is disrurbing, and the tone is set brilliantly by its amazing score. The final 15 minutes are some of the most intense and heartbreaking scenes ever filmed. This is a movie that may not be watched often, but will never be forgotten. It is an absolute masterpiece that must be viewed by all. 10/10"
No Name,4.5,A haunting score and editing mixed with stellar acting performances makes this an experience hard to forget.
No Name,4,This is intense! An outstanding film but also one of the most depressing movies ever.
No Name,5,This really should be a public service movie to ask people not to touch drugs
No Name,3.5,"You could watch it once, sure, but you'll never need to watch it a second time. Very detailed, makes you want to score, but, most of all will draw away all your curiosities of ever being on or doing drugs."
No Name,4.5,Don't do drugs kids!
No Name,5,"Requiem for a Dream is the movie that made me decide once and for all I would not do drugs. Surrounded by many movies like it such as Trainspotting and The Basketball Diaries, this is the only one that genuinely both moved and disturbed me. It is a tough watch but definitely a movie that all people (with strong stomachs) should check out.

This movie shows drug addiction through stories about a widowed woman, played to perfection by Ellen Burstyn, her son Harry, a great Jared Leto, his girlfriend Marion, a good Jennifer Connelly, and his best friend Tyrone, a spectacular Marlon Wayans at his best. All of these characters have a view of happiness that they are all trying to reach but addiction is getting in the way of them reaching it. 
All of the performances are off the charts. Every one in this movie gives it their all and it shows. The writing is great the dialogue is spot on. The direction is perfect from Darren Aronofsky, he really know how to make the audience feel like they are on drugs, and the cinematography is chilling, bleak, and perfect. And the score, oh my god the score, is so perfect and disturbing and fitting for this film. The sound track alone will give you chills. It really is one if the best soundtracks of all time in my opinion. 
Requiem for a Dream is a dark disturbing tale that is not for people who are bothered by strong depictions of addiction. It makes drugs not look fun for a change. It makes you not want to do them, which it was meant to do. This movie is great, and I have no flaws with it."
No Name,4,"Begins in search of pleasure and happiness and end up in having momentary bliss that has very dreadful consequences, the concept of Drugs always has the exiting stories to tell with attractive narrative pattern of awesome beginning to the awful ending, drugs intoxicates our body gradually that never let us to live properly or die happily, the obsession for such substances has very huge negative impact on an individual, 2000's 'Requiem for a Dream' is the master class work on drugs and drug addiction that perfectly showcases the overall effects and symptoms of the drug both physical and the social impacts. This movie clearly shows the self punishing act by slow poisoning our self with drugs, this film shows the unintentional attempt of the human towards self destruction.

'Requiem for a Dream' has very good narrative pattern that moves so effectively presenting the materials to its viewers and most specifically some extraordinary technical works in cinematography and editing had given the excellent impactive touch to the work, the scene of delusions by Sara, Harry's disintegrated journey that dilapidate his life, Marion's cravings makes her to end her life into the unpleasant and unwanted acts of guilt, every characters has been designed with each specific distinct traits of its own, Burstyn is the actual superstar of this flick she has rendered very wonderful performance as the diet buff, her expressions are very fantastic, Jarred and Jennifer had made the good act and gave justice to their role, the rapid scenes are the exclusive signature of this film, the bgm's are so perfect accordingly to the scene that intensifies the mood of the audience, truly this is the work of distinction."
No Name,4,An uncompromising and intense narrative.
No Name,4,"This haunting film brings you along for the joyous ascension of the protagonists, only to drop you down into their eventually realized nightmare."
No Name,5,"A funny, at times, but, sad view of addiction. This film shows the loneliness and desperation being an addict can bring as well as moments of hope and wanting something more. I wish I could give it more stars because the movie and the cast deserve more than a simple 5 star rating."
No Name,5,Fucking the best. 10 out of ten!!!!1!11!!one
No Name,5,"Still one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. This hallucinogenic cautionary tale about drug addiction does not hold back. The decent into the hellish depths of addiction is brilliantly acted by all. The score is also really powerful and as the four protagonists become more depraved,  tortured and in the end left like soulless zombies the music becomes almost hypnotic. Love it!"
No Name,5,One of the best films that I never want to have to experience again.
No Name,5,Amazing cinematography. One of the top 5 films of my life.
No Name,3,"I'm not really a fan of the movie. It reminds me of Fear And Loathing without the humor, without the likable characters, and the movie doesn't mean anything. It's the cinematic equivalent of an anti-drug PSA and has all the subtlety of Reefer Madness. But as someone who appreciates the art of downer cinema I give the movie credit for having some of the most distressing scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It didn't effect me emotionally because I just didn't care about the characters. It tries to pull a Martin Scorsese by showing us bad people who get it in the end, but Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are no Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. This might sound cruel, but the film kind of reminds me of an Itchy And Scratchy cartoon. Like I said, the exception are a few very pitiful scenes, but if you saw a real mouse chop up a real cat with a chainsaw you might find that a little more shocking. I think Aronofsky is overrated, but he's definitely a visionary. In the future I think he'll be more known for his impact on movies in general than the movies themselves."
No Name,5,This is pure art. One of the best films in history of cinema.
No Name,5,"I was surprised I did not add a review of this film earlier. Perhaps I forgot to.
Where do I start? This film is just an outstanding masterpiece. It delivers its content in a magnificent way. Although it took me 30 minutes to really start understand (a bit of) what was going on the film, the film gets possible to be understood after that quite easily. Truly a work of art. The story is phenomenal, actors are great, originality is top-notch and the overall quality of the film outbursts in hyper-sized shines (ironic, because it's a very dark film). There is much more that I had to write on this review, but I only like to make reviews right after watching the film, because a bit is forgotten and/or cannot be well explained, or put into words. Regardless, now the most important part of the review,....  I give this film a worthy 5/5, because it really deserves it. Totally on my favorite films of all time."
No Name,5,"This has to be one of the most disturbing yet beautiful movies I've ever seen. This is very much a cautionary tale, you will not watch this movie and feel happy and uplifted by the end. This is one of the most heart wrenching and realistic endings of all time, but it is most definitely a movie everyone needs to watch at least once in their life, you will never even want to touch heroin, pills, cocaine, or any other hard drug."
No Name,4,"Have to admit that thought this is by far the most depressing movie I have ever seen, Requiem for a Dream does have some insanely good cinematography and a good story telling skill."
No Name,3.5,"hense the title of the movie being the title of the song that is played throughout the movie, the song gets annoying, like the movie sometimes. the screenplay isnt that original, but i like it and it works. The cinemetography and scene editing is nice when it works, but its annoying, and unforgetable when it doesn't, but i understand why the filmmakers did some of these annoying things, and it really makes sence i just dont like it that much. most of the camera work is in the characters perspective and they are high most of the time, so its always kind of choppy, time-lapsed and fast motion blur, with weird sound effects and a boring score. the acting is pretty fuckin good, and thats what i really like about this movie, but almost every good thing in this movie was cancelled out by somthing bad, or somthing not good, or somthing that wasn't very entertaining. but as a whole i really dont think its that bad overall, i just think its a little over rated, and if it wasnt for the performances or casting and some of the disturbing imaginary scenes, and sometimes not imaginary scenes were very good, and some of the things written for the characters add alot of weight to the characters which made me want to watch more. this is not a thought provoking film which i wanted it to be, it is just plain, strait up weird and about drug addiction and what it is like to live in a world of coruption and drugs. the two best things about this movie, were the writing, and the strong performances from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely,Marlon Wayans surprisingly and Jared Leto's mother in the film that got nominated for an Oscar, which was definatly worthy. So, if you're bored and maybe considering having a movie marathon or somthing, because its definatly a film worth viewing. The positives are stronger than the negatives in this film."
No Name,5,"psychological effect of losing dreams, the effect of drugs and getting old and wasting all. best psycho-drama with powerful effect in our emotional state. i was carried away, that i may end up like Sarah. Im young."
No Name,3.5,"It's good, but like, fuck this movie."
No Name,1,"Really inconsistent movie. It's good at parts, but terrible at other. It's like a crazy roller coaster that will make you sick and nothing really happens in the movie. It's about prescription drugs and illegal drugs. About the effects about both of those drugs. Nothing special. Most concepts in this movie don't hold water over time because people should already know this. Also some of the effects of prescription drugs were way worse than the illegal drugs. It's really strange and isn't really cohesive. The movie then drags on for three years and I actually started to get tired. Overall its not complete trash but just on the list of another shitty Darren Aronofsky movie. 1.2"
No Name,4,As junkie movies goes this is my #1.  The different stories all meshing together is awesome. I felt the desperation felt by everyone in this movie.  I highly recommend this dark and wonderful movie!
No Name,4.5,"An exceptionally well-crafted thriller that still haunts my dreams to this day. Ghosts and creepy little kids are not scary. This is FRIGHTENING. The Ellen Burstyn hallucinations are some of the creepiest sequences I have ever seen. However, this is still a great film and although it may not have a Hollywood ending (to say the least), it sends a clear message to be careful with drugs."
No Name,4.5,"A powerful and disturbing story about addiction from Darren Aronofsky, Requiem for a Dream gives us the twin tales of a mother and sons fall into linked but very different drug-fuelled nightmares. There are moments of the darkest of humour as the lives of the pair spiral out of control but the fates of both are dealt with in an unflinching and graphic manner that is cold and disturbing. Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto lead the cast and for me, Burstyn's story is probably the most heart-breaking as we see the lonely old widow become dependent on tranquillisers and slimming pills as she becomes obsessed with the chance of appearing on a low-budget TV game show. This is a hard-hitting and deeply uncomfortable movie that seems as brutally relevant today as it was when it was first made over a decade ago. The score by the brilliant Clint Mansell underpins the onscreen imagery perfectly and has rightly gone on to have a life of its own, being instantly recognisable. Not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, this is a powerful drama from a superb filmmaker."
No Name,3.5,"Don't do drugs.
And with that, I will never watch this again."
No Name,4.5,"Once in a lifetime experience. I don't want to watch it again, but I'm surely glad I did watch it. Intense as fuck."
No Name,4,"Darren Aronofsky mostra-nos a adição das suas personagens de uma forma crua e alucinante. Jared Leto tem sem dúvida um toque de génio, Ellen Burstyn teve uma nomeação merecida aos Oscars mas quem me surpreendeu mais foi mesmo Jennifer Connelly."
No Name,5,Punch in the stomach . A film that you can't unsee.
No Name,3.5,"Wow, Requiem for a Dream is so dark and depressing. It is easily one of the most detailed looks into how drug abuse can destroy your life. Aronofsky uses every trick in the director's playbook to give the audience the sensation of being affected by the addictions of the main characters. There is shaky camera work, there are dramatic focus shifts. Even the music is used to create an unsettling atmosphere. It puts you on edge as a viewer, and makes it utterly impossible to relax while watching the movie. Perhaps the most amazing thing to me was that the actors actually managed to make their characters sympathetic to me. There were moments where I actually wanted them to have a successful sale in order to dig themselves out of the pit they had fallen into. Typically it's hard for me to identify with a movie character who continues to make the wrong decisions, but some magical combination of the script and the acting had me rooting for these people.

One of the most effective techniques that Aronofsky used in this film are the repetitive smash-cut montages of each step that goes into taking drugs. It made for a really artistic way of showing how the drug abuse had become routine to the characters, and it also offered a great contrast when later Ellen Burstyn's character became addicted to her own drug of choice. I also enjoyed what this film had to say about people who struggle with a less toxic, but perhaps just as damaging, addiction like television. It makes you question your own life and look to see what you have grown overly attached to that might be getting in the way of more important things. The one thing about Requiem for a Dream that kind of holds me back from absolutely falling in love with it is that this film is exceedingly hard to watch. In fact I can't picture subjecting myself to it again, at least not for a really long time. While I do think it is amazingly well-constructed, and startlingly realistic, there's nothing that would prompt me to want to go through that again."
No Name,4,Best movie I will never watch again.
No Name,4,"Highly recommended to young and elderly people, or everyone with potential exposure to drug abuse. The movie brilliantly described the outcome of drug addiction behavior. Portrayed lavishly in artistic manner, one may not notice the horrible hallucinogenic effect of drug prescription by any irresponsible medics. 

The theme song haunts ludicrously from beginning to end, however it colored the right atmosphere the picture needs. Grim, alarming, yet melancholic. 

Youth only come once, hence you may stumble once or few times but not to fall too deep nor steep for it may be too late to resuscitate later."
No Name,5,Take some time out for yourself after this movie. Then watch it again.
No Name,5,I will sum up this movie in less than 6 words. A Messed Up Anti-Drug PSA.
No Name,4.5,"A truly unbelievable experience, ""Requiem for a Dream"" chronicles descent into drug addiction with a stomach churning, bleak ferocity that is totally unparalleled.  Possibly the most important and effecting film about this subject matter ever made."
No Name,3.5,"Blends the gritty reality of addiction with an overarching poeticism, brilliant direction, and idiosyncratic, inspired acting.
Very intense and stark images are disturbing, beware.
Much like a dream with elements of the dark, desperate fears, this is a cautionary tale of filmmaking despite the disturbing subject matter."
No Name,4,"Disturbing, messed up and beautifully made. Requiem for a Dream was definitely one of a kind with great cinematography."
No Name,3,Well acted but I definitely couldn't sit through it again.
No Name,0.5,it's made me sick .. i even couldn't end it
No Name,4,"I always thank creating a movie about addiction will bring a stereotype, but this movie showed me that work of a great director may vary and be new, the effect of this movie on viewer is very high"
No Name,4.5,"***Due to the recent RT changes that have basically ruined my past reviews, I am mostly only giving a rating rather than a full review.***"
No Name,4,One of my favorites.
No Name,5,favorite movie!!! life = addiction
No Name,5,"""Marion... I've been thinking about you so much... are you okay?""

Requiem for a Dream is dark and perverted account of the downfall of four drug addicts. While basing his film around drugs, Aronofsky's use of imagery and detail will trigger a muscle in the viewers mind that explores all and any sort of - addiction. Requiem is about addiction, indecency, loss of love and innocence. It may appear as an anti-drug scheme to a basic minded individual but any open minded person will walk away challenged, I definitely was."
No Name,2.5,I still don't get why the big deal is.
No Name,5,Not for the faint... Bring your big boy pants to watch this film....but it's awesome!
No Name,3,Very jumbled up and at first glorified drugs.  As it went along it was then aimed at the miseries of drug use and abuse.  Very good in that aspect but overall a dull movie.  Acting was pretty decent.
No Name,4.5,Should be shown to the youth to keep them off drugs.
No Name,4.5,the tragic ending is a bit forced to be so emotional but great job on keeping it so unsettling
No Name,3,This is the most depressing film I've ever seen in my life. 10/10
No Name,5,A disturbingly horrific reality of the degrading negatives of drugs.
No Name,5,"Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a masterful work of art that is a powerful display of the damages of drug addiction. The finale of this movie will stick with you long after the credits roll. The movie's real and effective story, brilliant direction, and strong performances. It is by no means a film you will want to watch again any time soon or one that is easy to take in, but is one that must be experienced by everyone. The way the film uses quick shots and the haunting score give it a unique power that is truly well done. It's a deeply saddenining motion picture that will leave you shaking."
No Name,3,"it's hard to know where that line lies between desires and addiction; Aronofsky said this film isn't about drugs, it's about monsters -- everyone has potential to experience addiction to something (not necessarily drug related) and it's scary how fast you can fall under it's spell. the film did a great job of depicting just 4 examples of how addiction can change a person's life. even though none of the outcomes were good, the mother's story hit closer to home for me. i've never come close to wanting to do drugs, so hers was the most relatable. it's great to have goals and strive to be something better, but when that turns into obsession -- or rather, addiction -- you could be doing more harm than good."
No Name,3.5,It's good but it really is sometimes hard to watch.
No Name,5,Very depressing but very powerful film. This will stick with you in your mind for quite a while.
No Name,4.5,"When talk about best movies of all time, you must talk about this movie. Excellent."
No Name,5,"Truly depressing, but if you love movies, you can't miss it."
No Name,5,Can't even describe into words how much this movie means to me. Ellen Burstyn went above and beyond. Perfect film even if disturbing and heart wrenching in parts. I wish that Marlon Wayons would have walked out of that door that Aronofsky opened for him to be a serious actor... But he didn't. He chose to remain a Wayans and not be taken seriously.  Oh well. He had the chance.
No Name,4.5,????????????? ??????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????? ???????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????
No Name,5,Strong movie with a strong message. At the end it made me grateful I'm not addicted to anything. You gotta watch it in the right mood though cos it's depressing.
No Name,5,"Fantastic, trippy, beautiful, and haunting"
No Name,5,This movie left me speechless. The way that it goes from scene to scene is insane. This movie never gets old from start to finish. One of the best movies out there.
No Name,4.5,masterful and macabre
No Name,4.5,"A filmmaking masterpiece, the editing is phenomenal as well as the pace of the film. 2 men and a woman strive to make it in New York City selling heroin, but end up realizing they've embarked on the wrong path. Definitely leaves you speechless at the end. Great replay value, a timeless classic."
No Name,5,"Uma das maiores performances do cinema vinda de  Ellen Burstyn e uma das mais competentes direções do ano de seu lançamento, ""Réquiem para um Sonho"" é tão perturbador quanto seu título, e comove, deprime e enlouquece mais que qualquer pílula."
No Name,2.5,"Good Visuals, but over all the film feels like a one hour PSA on not doing drugs..The Problem with this film is that there is no character to connect with, they are all egotistical or selfish morons, why should I care about a character who is an ass to his mom and dose drugs to death?"
No Name,4.5,"This film is about drugs and addiction. Not a love story, not a happy ending tale. It shows were a person could end up, when using. It;s brutal, but it;s true. it's a punch in the face, disturbing."
No Name,5,A movie so horrifying that you can't look away if you tried. This movie will make you want to never do drugs and give you nightmares for quite a while. Also an awesome and fitting soundtrack.
No Name,4.5,What an intense film!
No Name,3,"Stylistic. Delirious. Confronting. Burstyn plays her tragic role perfectly. While Leto, Wayans and Connelly remind us how horribly wrong it could all go.... TL;DW - Drugs are bad."
No Name,4,One of the most disturbing movies you will ever seen... you won't be the same after seeing it... guaranteed.
No Name,5,"10/10
another classic, really fucked up"
No Name,4,a striking story.. details are dazzling.. no word to say!
No Name,4,"Well-made, deeply unsettling and potent, the strength of this film lies in its editing and the actors' performances. While sometimes overbearing, and though I do still go to 'Trainspotting' when I need a hard reminder of the tolls that addiction takes, this film deserves some credit as well."
No Name,3.5,Avoided watching this for years - and for a reason. Quite shocking stuff...
No Name,5,A truly incredible film that I never want to see again.
No Name,5,Such a twisted film... Just perfect!
No Name,3,Tragic film banking on quick cuts of flashy over-stimulation.  I appreciate the effort and some of the artistic liberties taken but saw the characters' conclusions a bit forced and over-the-top.
No Name,4,"While this is one of Aronofsky's better movies with some great cinematography and style,the first half of Requiem For a Dream should be as powerful, potent, and viscerally emotional as the second. However, few movies have been able to capture what drug addiction does to our bodies, to our minds, and to our lifestyle so well. If you want someone close to you to stop drug addiction, make them watch this movie; it's *that* shocking."
No Name,3.5,"While most people see movies solely for entertainment value, several of us actually welcome a challenge. Requiem for a Dream is a graphic and often unpleasant movie, but it's evident that was the intention. Disney cartoons and comic-book blockbusters are all fine and good, but movies like this are the reason I'm a movie addict. Movies about young, strung-out junkies are not new. Movies like Another Day in Paradise, Rush, and Kids all addressed similar issues, to varying degrees of success. The tough part is not showing the ugliness of heroin addiction. Just watch someone shooting up and you're seeing a tragedy. What's difficult is presenting honest characters, and not apologizing for their actions. They're not heroes or villains in Aronofsky's hands, and how you feel about these characters lies with you. The screenplay doesn't guide you, and any movie that forces you to decide things for yourself is always a welcome change.

Everyone has their addictions, right? For some, it's crack cocaine. Others can't function without their morning cup of coffee. Love, contentment, approval, happiness; Wish for any of them too hard, and you find yourself an addict. Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream displays how rampant addiction affects the lives of four interlocked characters, and it's not a pretty picture. But that's exactly why this is an excellent movie. While several scenes are of unnerving discomfort, the intention is never simply to shock. A filmmaker can ""stun"" an audience whenever he wants to; it's his party. The tough part is to tell a story and prove thematic points by using the shock value responsibly.

Harry (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict. When we first meet him, he is appropriating his mother's television set to hock for his next ""fix"". Long-suffering mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn) screams with her son, but never really gets angry with him. Five minutes later, she's simply buying the TV back. Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) also participate in Harry's hypodermic activities, and the three eventually hatch a plan: To become dealers on their own and make thousands of bucks! Meanwhile, Sarah has received a strange phone call, promising her a spot as a TV contestant. Alone in her home, she quickly begins preparing for her night on TV by popping diet pills.

This is a movie of several excellent components, most notably a handful of excellent performances, a restrained yet visually stunning directorial style, and a hypnotic musical score. While a handful of scenes linger a bit too long, that's a nearly pointless complaint in a movie so strong on nearly every other level. Requiem for a Dream is not a ""fun"" movie, nor is it merely a drug-related melodrama. This is a smart movie about how addiction shackles people, for movie fans who can handle the heavy stuff.

Ellen Burstyn is remarkable in this movie. While she hasn't been seen in films too often lately, her performance simply should place her back in this should have placed her in the public eye. As a woman who becomes increasingly more unable to deal with reality, she is heart-breakingly believable, and the result is one of the best acting performances I have seen. Also quite surprising is the work of Jennifer Connelly, in a nearly impossible role. Her stunning beauty has somehow mislabeled her as a ""pin-up"" actress, as she's nearly always excellent, regardless of how small the role. She'll get a lot of attention for her courageous performance. Jared Leto is serviceable as the anti-hero Harry. Although it's easy to buy him as a junkie, he simply plays his role too clean-cut most of the time. Leto is tough to buy him as a sleazy addict when he looks like the cover of a Teen magazine. Director Aronofsky presents several unique sequences, and he offers several harsh and resonant montage sequences, some truly shocking visual sequences, and a wonderfully effective usage of sound effects. (Each moment of addiction satisfaction is presented in a rapid-fire display of color, light and sound.) Especially memorable is the use of the infectious score by Clint Mansell, which gives the movie a dark, desperate heartbeat.

Much has currently been made of the MPAA's decision to threaten this movie an NC-17 rating, thanks to a sequence near the end, which depicts some particularly unsavory acts. Apparently, The MPAA missed the point of this movie entirely. By deleting (or even editing) the scene in question would negate the entire point of the movie: That true addiction leads to true degradation. I was glad he didn't compromise.

I can't promise that you'll love this movie, but you'll be able to see how censoring a movie can sometimes disembowel it. Requiem for a Dream is a tough movie to watch, but the film offers a lot to enjoy. Darren Aronofsky deftly avoids many of the ""drug-movie"" cliches so evident in other films of this style, and his film is a sobering and fascinating piece of work. While this movie is NOT for all tastes, I can recommend it as one of the best and bravest drug-movies ever made . Requiem for a Dream is a film that will stay with you long after you leave the theater, and it's a rare film that can do that."
No Name,5,"Everything about this movie is fantastic. The score, the acting, the story, the writing, the directing, the visuals, literally everything. No movie has ever left me feeling so hopeless before, and to this day it is the only movie that has physically shaken me.

Requiem For a Dream is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and it might very well be the best movie of the 2000s thus far. If you haven't seen it, I implore you to watch it.

11/10"
No Name,5,"An experience so you don't have to. Once you see it from start to finish, you'll understand. Overall, a masterpiece of visual storytelling and character empathy."
No Name,5,This is an impossible movie to rate. Did I like it? No. Is it extremely well made? Absolutely. This beautifully directed and acted movie is truly stunning. The most powerful movie I've ever seen. Never before has a movie truly disturbed me to the point of sweating or cringing. Ellen gives a powerful performance especially near the end of the film. Requiem for a Dream has a very claustrophobic feeling to it and you will hardly be able to breath during the movie due to the intensity and atmosphere. Lux aterna is a great song and the soundtrack really adds to the movie as a whole. A movie that is impossible to forget and will leave you stunned for a long time after the credits role.
No Name,4,"Yeah, answers.com definitely classifies this correctly under the ""fantastic films you only want to watch once"" list."
No Name,2.5,"A visceral experience if nothing else. Fearless acting performances and stylistically daring choices by Darron Aranofsky gives 'Requiem' a fascinatingly hypnotic quality, but the film's insistently grotesque, bludgeoning imagery and overwrought chaos violently collapses in on itself as the thing devolves into a suspect mess."
No Name,5,I love it its unique and meaningful.
No Name,4,I will never touch a drug in my life after seeing this film...
No Name,5,"The most bone chilliing movie I have ever seen. This movie gives us a very realistic portrayal of drugs and the dark corners of humans and how far they can go for it. This movie honestly scares with its realism. The performances are Top-Notch! And why didn't the theme song ""Requiem for a Tower"" win/get nominated for any Oscars? It is awesome and just like the movie, Bone chilling. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen...but I never want to see it again. Understand my logic?"
No Name,4.5,"WOW!!  What a ""don't do drugs"" ad! Great acting and the cinematography is GREAT as well as the acting! Even a bigger Jared Leto fan now!"
No Name,4,"The people at D.A.R.E. must salivate over this movie. If you've ever found yourself wondering whether or not to try hard drugs, this film should put that flame out with a vengeance."
No Name,5,"Disturbing, incredible editing, Ellen Burstyn plays her role brilliantly, fantastic story that keeps you hooked."
No Name,5,"Brutally awfull, Aronofsky's Requiem shows us how we destroy our lifes by choosing to live our fantasies. Very strong and intended for a mature audience, this movie is a living nightmare that will pursuit forever. You will never forget Ellen Burstyn perfomance or Jared Leto's arm. One of the best"
No Name,2,"*OFFICIAL BETTER THAN EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE SEAL*

Emotionally manipulative waste of time that cares more about its anti drug message than its characters.

Great music though."
No Name,5,Mr. Aronofsky's masterpiece
No Name,5,"The term ""nightmare film"" does not mean a film that is so terrible that it was a nightmare to make, rather it refers to a film that it the living embodiment of a nightmare that one would have. Requiem for a Dream plays out in a way that can only have been drawn from someone's deepest psychological terrors that come out to play in the time of twilight, in which the definite barrier between reality and hallucination is commonly deteriorated. This is probably one of Mr Mackey's favourite movies."
No Name,4,The best anti drug movie of all time. Its a great movie that I never want to see again.
No Name,5,Probably my favorite independent film and the best movie I've ever seen on drug addiction. With a fantastic visual style and brilliant score this movie will haunt you long after you've watched it.
No Name,4,"dirty, grimy, glad finally glad i saw it. almost evil. Could have have easily been set in Collingwood, or Brixton at the same time."
No Name,3.5,"It may be a bit dull at times, but good nonetheless."
No Name,4.5,"The movie is as entretaining as it gets just as its harsh and imaginative, and its a cinematographical achievement, filled with shocking and heartbreaking moments supported by the stellar cast and almost perfect directing and writing. One hell of an amazing and shocking ride."
No Name,5,"Everything a movie should be. 

It shows the harsh reality of drug addiction through great performances and simple yet impactful cinematography. This movie won't  leave you with a cheesy message or a cliche uplifting ending."
No Name,5,"Once you lay your eyes on it, you won't be forgetting it anytime soon.

No Name,4,"Notable como pocas, Réquiem for a Dream tiene un gran problema. No es agradable de ver. 4 historias vinculadas a la droga y la soledad se mezclan, desencadenado cada una en especie de locura. La obra que consolidó a Aronofsky como director de renombre, y en especial a Clint Mansell, por un soundtrack que quizás es el más conocido de la historia. Recomendable, pero afirme el estómago."
No Name,5,"As it stands right now, Requiem for a Dream is not the most comfortable film to watch, but in terms of the acting, the execution, and the imagery, it is a masterpiece.

No Name,3.5,"7.5/10

Requiem for a Dream is a true visual marvel, and does a brilliant job of creating nail-biting tension and a nightmarish scenario - however, it's a bit too heavy handed in its anti-drug message to truly soar."
No Name,5,5 stars come on people
No Name,5,Darren Aronofsky is a true cinematic artist. Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto have palpitating chemistry.
No Name,5,"A masterpiece. If you still want to do drugs after seeing it, then I have no words. Love the pulse-pounding score and cinematography."
No Name,2.5,"Although there are some really creative shots and ways to covey the different addictions, this is an oppressively miserable film."
No Name,3,"The message gets a bit muddled. Heroin and diet pills can destroy lives, but the characters are also destroyed by neglectful doctors (Sara's doctor not picking up on her hallucinations, Harry's doctor ignoring the arm) and a justice system that fails to understand that many druggies are non-violent people that should face rehabilitation and not retribution (Marlon's narrative). The message seems to be this: addiction is bad, drugs are bad, don't do them or they will destroy your lives, but too many extraneous variables are in the narrative. What is the film trying to say? I feel like it was just trying to be bleak and depressing for the sake of it. Well-filmed though."
No Name,4.5,"Despite the obvious lack of subtlety, this rightfully depressing and memorable movie is expertly crafted and acted, resulting in a vivid and formidable picture of our darkest human qualities."
No Name,5,"Bleak, devastating and profoundly honest, this film manages to say more in under 2 hours than most can do in a lifetime."
No Name,5,"Powerful, scary and dramatic!
I watched the movie about 10 years ago and just watched it again, it still has the same impact on me. Definitely a masterpiece!"
No Name,1.5,"I got to say that ""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of the unusual movie I have ever seen. It's a movie that you will have no understanding the story line. The performances in this movie are kind of acceptable. Darren Aronofsky gives us some that is a different style in his directing. The screenplay by Hubert Selby, Jr. is okay. The score is fine. ""I got to say that this is not my favorite."
No Name,5,"So mad at myself for putting off seeing this film for so long.
This film is mainly about the abuse of drugs and how they end up ruining your life one way or another if you have no self control. But then again, heroin is said to be quite addicting.

Harry (Jared Leto), girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connolly) and friend and partner Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are good friends who like to do drugs. But they either do it to feel good in general or to stop themselves from feeling bad in a bad situation. This film gives a great look into how addicts do drugs and everything is all better to them. Harry and Tyrone get into a sticky situation when they are in need of more drugs so they take part in a drug lord's operation, making them eventually travel from their hometown of Brooklyn to Miami, where Harry is forcibly taken to the hospital by Tyrone so doctors can take a look at his dead arm. At the end of the film, the two of them end up going to prison and Harry's arm is amputated.

Marion on the other hand continues to support her addiction by taking part in prostitution and sex rings.

As for another important character, Sara (Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's mother who is widowed and stays home and watches her favorite infomercial/game show all day long. She gets a call one day saying that she has been chosen to appear on said show. To lose weight, she tries to go on a diet, failing, and then succumbing to horribly addicting diet pills.

It's a sad road Sara travels on. She becomes addicted to these pills and becomes mentally unstable, waiting to hear from the producers of the show to tell her when she can be on the show.

In the end, all four characters curl up in a fettle position.
I cried deeply.

This film is so sad but also, so incredible well directed and edited with great camera work and great fast paced scenes (hip hop cuts), especially cuts on drug related items during at which time the audience assumes the characters are getting high.

Such a once in a lifetime film. Every mature minded individual should see it.

Requiem for a Dream, I give you a 100%."
No Name,5,The kind of movie one does never get to forget and changes the way you see everything.
No Name,4.5,"Two word review: Slowly Intense. The story starts out slow, but gradually crescendos into a chaotic, awesome climax, as the lives of all four main characters unravel around them, terrible but impossible to look away from. All the stories are amazing, making it impossible to not care about the characters. Fantastic movie, but very intense. Not for the faint of heart."
No Name,4.5,"""Oh my God Harry.."" - The opening line to my absolute favorite Bastille song (It's a cover song, but I don't give a shiz): Requiem For Blue Jeans. The movie starts out on a frantic/sad/confusing/angry note, and spirals out of control so fast, you won't even know what hit you. From a non-drug addicts perspective, Requiem has you trying to relate to what everyone is feeling or going through, it's a roller coaster of back catalog memories. Requiem is a massive slap in the face to anyone that has a drug addiction, and if they continue to use after having seen this movie, well, may God have mercy on their soul. The editing and imagery was executed perfectly. At no point in the film did I feel lost (except the first 5 minutes, but then everything became VERY clear to me what was going on) or confused about the timeline of events taking place, it flowed exceedingly well. The amount of sorrow I felt for each character at certain points, summoned ol' Kermit to the back of my throat. When Kermit makes an appearance, I know the movie is a winner. Requiem for a Dream is extremely powerful and should not be taken with a grain of salt. Thanks to this recommendation, I could finally put a face to yet another favorite bastille cover song of mine. The song: What Would You Do -- fades out with the following quote, ""It's a reason to get up in the morning. It's a reason to lose weight, to fit in the red dress. It's a reason to smile. It makes tomorrow all right."" I never searched the quote or let it bother me too much that I didn't have the slightest clue what movie it came from, because it was too beautiful to want to google it. There was a certain air of mystery behind the voice that I loved hearing so much. However, the pictures in my mind will be that much more meaningful to these songs after having seen this movie. And yes, I have a terrible addiction to Bastille. Let's just hope it doesn't spiral out of control.."
